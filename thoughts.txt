what next:
- write preprocessing scripts: get a list of paragraphs (requires some judgement calls as to what exactly a paragraph is)
- do some exploratory unsupervised classification
- do some reading up on trade and free trade agreements
- read up the stanford nlp textbook


some issues:
- how do we handle non-english texts? do we simply get rid of them i think we should
- only do one of stemming and lemmatization
