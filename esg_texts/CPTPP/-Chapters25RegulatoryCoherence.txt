REGULATORY COHERENCE 
 
 
Article 25.1:  Definitions 
 
For the purposes of this Chapter: 
 
covered regulatory measure means the regulatory measure determined by each 
Party to be subject to this Chapter in accordance with Article 25.3 (Scope of 
Covered Regulatory Measures); and 
 
regulatory measure means a measure of general application related to any matter 
covered  by  this  Agreement  adopted  by  regulatory  agencies  with  which 
compliance is mandatory. 
 
  
Article 25.2:  General Provisions 
 
1.  For the purposes of this Chapter, regulatory coherence refers to the use of 
good  regulatory  practices  in  the  process  of  planning,  designing,  issuing, 
implementing  and  reviewing  regulatory  measures  in  order  to  facilitate 
achievement of domestic policy objectives, and in efforts across governments to 
enhance regulatory cooperation in order to further those objectives and promote 
international trade and investment, economic growth and employment.   
 
2.  The Parties affirm the importance of: 
 
(a)  sustaining and enhancing the benefits of this Agreement through 
regulatory  coherence  in  terms  of  facilitating  increased  trade  in 
goods and services and increased investment between the Parties; 
 
(b)  each Party’s sovereign right to identify its regulatory priorities and 
establish  and  implement  regulatory  measures  to  address  these 
priorities, at the levels that the Party considers appropriate; 
 
(c)  the role that regulation plays in achieving public policy objectives; 
 
(d)  taking  into  account  input  from  interested  persons  in  the 
development of regulatory measures; and 
 
(e)  developing regulatory cooperation and capacity building between 
the Parties. 
 
25-1 
 
Article 25.3:  Scope of Covered Regulatory Measures 
 
  Each Party shall promptly, and no later than one year after the date of 
entry into force of this Agreement for that Party, determine and make publicly 
available the scope of its covered regulatory measures.  In determining the scope 
of covered regulatory measures, each Party should aim to achieve significant 
coverage.  
 
 
Article 25.4:  Coordination and Review Processes or Mechanisms  
 
1.   The Parties recognise that regulatory coherence can be facilitated through 
domestic  mechanisms  that  increase  interagency  consultation  and  coordination 
associated with processes for developing regulatory measures.  Accordingly, each 
Party shall endeavour to ensure that it has processes or mechanisms to facilitate 
the effective interagency coordination and review of proposed covered regulatory 
measures.  Each Party should consider establishing and maintaining a national or 
central coordinating body for this purpose.  
 
2.  The Parties recognise that while the processes or mechanisms referred to 
in  paragraph  1  may  vary  between  Parties  depending  on  their  respective 
circumstances (including differences in levels of development and political and 
institutional structures), they should generally have as overarching characteristics 
the ability to:  
 
(a)  review  proposed  covered  regulatory  measures  to  determine  the 
extent to which the development of such measures adheres to good 
regulatory practices, which may include but are not limited to those 
set out in Article 25.5 (Implementation of Core Good Regulatory 
Practices), and make recommendations based on that review; 
 
(b)  strengthen consultation and coordination among domestic agencies 
so as to identify potential overlap and duplication and to prevent 
the creation of inconsistent requirements across agencies; 
 
(c)  make recommendations for systemic regulatory improvements; and 
 
(d)  publicly report on regulatory measures reviewed, any proposals for 
systemic regulatory improvements, and any updates on changes to 
the processes and mechanisms referred to in paragraph 1. 
 
Each Party should generally produce documents that include descriptions of those 
processes or mechanisms and that can be made available to the public. 
 
 
 
25-2 
Article 25.5:  Implementation of Core Good Regulatory Practices 
 
1.  To assist in designing a measure to best achieve the Party’s objective, each 
Party should generally encourage relevant regulatory agencies, consistent with its 
laws and regulations, to conduct regulatory impact assessments when developing 
proposed  covered  regulatory  measures  that  exceed  a  threshold  of  economic 
impact, or other regulatory impact, where appropriate, as established by the Party.  
Regulatory  impact  assessments  may  encompass  a  range  of  procedures  to 
determine possible impacts. 
 
2.  Recognising that differences in the Parties’ institutional, social, cultural, 
legal  and  developmental  circumstances  may  result  in  specific  regulatory 
approaches, regulatory impact assessments conducted by a Party should, among 
other things: 
 
(a)  assess the need for a regulatory proposal, including a description of 
the nature and significance of the problem;  
 
(b)  examine feasible alternatives, including, to the extent feasible and 
consistent with laws and regulations, their costs and benefits, such 
as risks involved as well as distributive impacts, recognising that 
some costs and benefits are difficult to quantify and monetise; 
 
(c)  explain the grounds for concluding that the selected alternative 
achieves the policy objectives in an efficient manner, including, if 
appropriate, reference to the costs and benefits and the potential for 
managing risks; and 
 
(d)  rely  on  the  best  reasonably  obtainable  existing  information 
including  relevant  scientific,  technical,  economic  or  other 
information, within the boundaries of the authorities, mandates and 
resources of the particular regulatory agency. 
 
3.   When conducting regulatory impact assessments, a Party may take into 
consideration the potential impact of the proposed regulation on SMEs.  
 
4.  Each Party should ensure that new covered regulatory measures are plainly 
written and are clear, concise, well organised and easy to understand, recognising 
that some measures address technical issues and that relevant expertise may be 
needed to understand and apply them.  
 
5.  Subject to its laws and regulations, each Party should ensure that relevant 
regulatory  agencies  provide  public  access  to  information  on  new  covered 
regulatory  measures  and,  where  practicable,  make  this  information  available 
online. 
 
25-3 
6.   Each Party should review, at intervals it deems appropriate, its covered 
regulatory measures to  determine whether specific regulatory measures  it has 
implemented should be modified, streamlined, expanded or repealed so as to 
make the Party’s regulatory regime more effective in achieving the Party’s policy 
objectives. 
 
7.  Each Party should, in a manner it deems appropriate, and consistent with 
its laws and regulations, provide annual public notice of any covered regulatory 
measure that it reasonably expects its regulatory agencies to issue within the 
following 12-month period. 
 
8.  To the extent appropriate and consistent with its law, each Party should 
encourage  its  relevant regulatory  agencies to consider regulatory  measures in 
other Parties, as well as relevant developments in international, regional and other 
fora when planning covered regulatory measures.  
 
 
Article 25.6:  Committee on Regulatory Coherence 
 
1.  The  Parties  hereby  establish  a  Committee  on  Regulatory  Coherence 
(Committee), composed of government representatives of the Parties.  
 
2.  The Committee shall consider issues associated with the implementation 
and operation of this Chapter.  The Committee shall also consider identifying 
future priorities, including potential sectoral initiatives and cooperative activities, 
involving  issues  covered  by  this  Chapter  and  issues  related  to  regulatory 
coherence covered by other Chapters of this Agreement.  
 
3.  In identifying future priorities, the Committee shall take into account the 
activities of other committees, working groups and any other subsidiary body 
established under this Agreement and shall coordinate with them in order to avoid 
duplication of activities.   
 
4.  The Committee shall ensure that its work on regulatory cooperation offers 
value  in  addition  to  initiatives  underway  in  other  relevant  fora  and  avoids 
undermining or duplicating such efforts.   
 
5.  Each  Party  shall  designate  and  notify  a  contact  point  to  provide 
information, on request by another Party, regarding the implementation of this 
Chapter in accordance with Article 27.5 (Contact Points). 
 
6.  The Committee shall meet within one year of the date of entry into force 
of this Agreement, and thereafter as necessary.   
 
7.  At least once every five years after the date of entry into force of this 
Agreement,  the  Committee  shall  consider  developments  in  the  area  of  good 
regulatory practices and in best practices in maintaining processes or mechanisms 
25-4 
referred to in Article 25.4.1 (Coordination and Review Processes or Mechanisms), 
as well as the Parties’ experiences in implementing this Chapter with a view 
towards considering whether to make recommendations to the Commission for 
improving the provisions of this Chapter so as to further enhance the benefits of 
this Agreement. 
 
 
Article 25.7:  Cooperation 
 
1.  The Parties shall cooperate in order to facilitate the implementation of this 
Chapter and to maximise the benefits arising from it.  Cooperation activities shall 
take into consideration each Party’s needs, and may include:

(d)  strengthening  cooperation  and  other  relevant  activities  between 
regulatory agencies; and 
 
(e)  other activities that Parties may agree.  
 
2.  The  Parties  further  recognise  that  cooperation  between  Parties  on 
regulatory matters can be enhanced through, among other things, ensuring that 
each Party’s regulatory measures are centrally available. 
 
 
Article 25.8:  Engagement with Interested Persons 
 
  The  Committee  shall  establish  appropriate  mechanisms  to  provide 
continuing opportunities for interested persons of the Parties to provide input on 
matters relevant to enhancing regulatory coherence. 
 
 
Article 25.9:  Notification of Implementation  
 
1.  For the purposes of transparency, and to serve as a basis for cooperation 
and capacity building activities under this Chapter, each Party shall submit a 
notification  of  implementation  to  the  Committee  through  the  contact  points 
designated pursuant to Article 27.5 (Contact Points) within two years of the date 
of entry into force of this Agreement for that Party and at least once every four 
years thereafter. 
 
25-5 
2.  In its initial notification, each Party shall describe the steps that it has 
taken since the date of entry into force of this Agreement for that Party, and the 
steps that it plans to take to implement this Chapter, including those to: 
 
(a)  establish  processes  or  mechanisms  to  facilitate  effective 
interagency  coordination  and  review  of  proposed  covered 
regulatory measures in accordance with Article 25.4 (Coordination 
and Review Processes or Mechanisms); 
 
(b)  encourage  relevant  regulatory  agencies  to  conduct  regulatory

(e)  provide information to the public in its annual notice of prospective 
covered  regulatory  measures  in  accordance  with  Article  25.5.7 
(Implementation of Core Regulatory Practices). 
 
3.  In subsequent notifications, each Party shall describe the steps, including 
those set out in paragraph 2, that it has taken since the previous notification, and 
those that it plans to take to implement this Chapter, and to improve its adherence 
to it.  
 
4.  In  its  consideration  of  issues  associated  with  the  implementation  and 
operation of this Chapter, the Committee may review notifications made by a 
Party pursuant to paragraph 1.  During that review, Parties may ask questions or 
discuss specific aspects of that Party’s notification.  The Committee may use its 
review and discussion of a notification as a basis for identifying opportunities for 
assistance and  cooperative  activities to  provide assistance in  accordance with 
Article 25.7 (Cooperation).
