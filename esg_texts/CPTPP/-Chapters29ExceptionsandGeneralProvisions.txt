taking  action,  including  maintaining  or  increasing  a  customs  duty,  that  is 
authorised by the Dispute Settlement Body of the WTO or is taken as a result of a 
decision by a dispute settlement panel under a free trade agreement to which the 
Party taking action and the Party against which the action is taken are party. 
 
 
Article 29.2:  Security Exceptions 
 
Nothing in this Agreement shall be construed to: 
 
(a)   require a Party to furnish or allow access to any information the 
disclosure of which it determines to be contrary to its essential 
security interests; or 
 
 
Article 29.3:  Temporary Safeguard Measures

adopting or maintaining restrictive measures with regard to payments or transfers

relating to the movements of capital:

difficulties or threats thereof; or 
 
  (b)  if, in exceptional circumstances, payments or transfers relating to 
capital movements cause or threaten to cause serious difficulties

3.  Any measure adopted or maintained under paragraph 1 or 2 shall: 
 
  (a)  not be inconsistent with Article 9.4 (National Treatment), Article 
9.5  (Most-Favoured-Nation  Treatment),  Article  10.3  (National

described in paragraph 1 or 2; 
 
  (e)  be temporary and be phased out progressively as the situations 
specified in paragraph 1 or 2 improve, and shall not exceed 18 
months in duration; however, in exceptional circumstances, a Party 
may extend such measure for additional periods of one year, by 
notifying  the  other  Parties  in  writing  within  30  days  of  the 
extension,  unless  after  consultations  more  than  one-half  of  the 
Parties  advise,  in  writing,  within  30  days  of  receiving  the 
notification that they do not agree that the extended measure is 
designed and applied to satisfy subparagraphs (c), (d) and (h), in 
which  case  the  Party  imposing  the  measure  shall  remove  the

conformity with subparagraphs (c), (d) and (h), taking into account 
the  views  of  the  other  Parties,  within  90  days  of  receiving 
notification that more than one half of the Parties do not agree; 
 
(f)  not  be  inconsistent  with  Article  9.8  (Expropriation  and 
Compensation);5

4  Without prejudice to the general interpretation of Article 9.4 (National Treatment), Article 9.5 
(Most-Favoured-Nation Treatment), Article 10.3 (National Treatment), Article 10.4 (Most-
Favoured-Nation Treatment), Article 11.3 (National Treatment) and Article 11.4 (Most-Favoured-
Nation Treatment), the fact that a measure adopted or maintained pursuant to paragraph 1 or 2 
differentiates between investors on the basis of residency does not necessarily mean that the 
measure is inconsistent with Article 9.4 (National Treatment), Article 9.5 (Most-Favoured-Nation 
Treatment), Article 10.3 (National Treatment), Article 10.4 (Most-Favoured-Nation Treatment), 
Article 11.3 (National Treatment) and Article 11.4 (Most-Favoured-Nation Treatment). 
 
5 For greater certainty, measures referred to in paragraph 1 or 2 may be non-discriminatory 
regulatory actions by a Party that are designed and applied to protect legitimate public welfare 
objectives as referred to in Annex 9-B(3)(b) (Expropriation). 
 
6  The term “restricted assets” in this subparagraph refers only to assets invested in the territory of 
the restricting Party by an investor of a Party that are restricted from being transferred out of the 
territory of the restricting Party. 
29-3  
 
(h)  not be used to avoid necessary macroeconomic adjustment. 
 
4.  Measures referred to in paragraphs 1 and 2 shall not apply to payments or 
transfers relating to foreign direct investment.7 
 
5.  A  Party  shall  endeavour  to  provide  that  any  measures  adopted  or 
maintained under paragraph 1 or 2 be price-based, and if such measures are not 
price-based, the Party shall explain the rationale for using quantitative restrictions 
when it notifies the other Parties of the measure. 
 
6.  In  the  case  of  trade  in  goods,  Article  XII  of  GATT  1994  and  the 
Understanding on the Balance of Payments Provisions of the GATT 1994 are 
incorporated  into  and  made  part  of  this  Agreement,  mutatis  mutandis.    Any 
measures adopted or maintained under this paragraph shall not impair the relative 
benefits accorded to the other Parties under this Agreement as compared to the 
treatment of a non-Party. 
 
7.  A Party adopting or maintaining measures under paragraph 1, 2 or 6 shall: 
 
(a)  notify, in writing, the other Parties of the measures, including any 
changes  therein,  along  with  the  rationale  for  their  imposition, 
within 30 days of their adoption; 
 
(b)  present,  as  soon  as  possible,  either  a  time  schedule  or  the 
conditions necessary for their removal; 
 
(c)  promptly publish the measures; and 
 
(d)  promptly commence consultations with the other Parties in order to 
review the measures adopted or maintained by it. 
 
(i)  In the case of capital movements, promptly respond to any 
other Party that  requests consultations in  relation to  the 
measures adopted by it, provided that such consultations 
are not otherwise taking place outside of this Agreement. 
 
(ii)  In the case of current account restrictions, if consultations 
in relation to the measures adopted by it are not taking 
place  under  the  framework  of  the  WTO  Agreement,  a 
                                                                                                                                      
 
7  For the purposes of this Article, “foreign direct investment” means a type of investment by an 
investor of a Party in the territory of another Party, through which the investor exercises 
ownership or control over, or a significant degree of influence on the management of, an 
enterprise or other direct investment, and tends to be undertaken in order to establish a lasting 
relationship.  For example, ownership of at least 10 per cent of the voting power of an enterprise 
over a period of at least 12 months generally would be considered foreign direct investment. 
29-4  
Party, if requested, shall promptly commence consultations 
with any interested Party.

29-5  
 
or any successor of these designated authorities as notified in writing to the other 
Parties; 
 
tax convention means a convention for the avoidance of double taxation or other 
international taxation agreement or arrangement; and 
 
taxes and taxation measures include excise duties, but do not include: 
 
(a)    a “customs duty” as defined in Article 1.3 (General Definitions); or 
 
  (b)   the measures listed in subparagraphs (b) and (c) of that definition. 
 
2.  Except as provided in this Article, nothing in this Agreement shall apply to 
taxation measures. 
 
3.  Nothing in this Agreement shall affect the rights and obligations of any 
Party under any tax convention.  In the event of any inconsistency between this 
Agreement and any such tax convention, that convention shall prevail to the 
extent of the inconsistency. 
 
4.  In the case of a tax convention between two or more Parties, if an issue 
arises as to whether any inconsistency exists between this Agreement and the tax 
convention, the issue shall be referred to the designated authorities of the Parties 
in question.  The designated authorities of those Parties shall have six months 
from the date of referral of the issue to make a determination as to the existence 
and extent of any inconsistency.  If those designated authorities agree, the period 
may be extended up to 12 months from the date of referral of the issue.  No 
procedures concerning the measure giving rise to the issue may be initiated under 
Chapter  28  (Dispute  Settlement)  or  Article  9.19  (Submission  of  a  Claim  to 
Arbitration) until the expiry of the six-month period, or any other period as may 
have been agreed by the designated authorities.  A panel or tribunal established to 
consider  a  dispute  related  to  a  taxation  measure  shall  accept  as  binding  a 
determination  of  the  designated  authorities  of  the  Parties  made  under  this 
paragraph. 
 
5.  Notwithstanding paragraph 3: 
 
(a)  Article 2.3 (National Treatment) and such other provisions of this 
Agreement as are necessary to  give effect  to  that Article shall 
apply to taxation measures to the same extent as does Article III of 
GATT 1994; and 
 
(b)  Article 2.15 (Export Duties, Taxes or other Charges) shall apply to 
taxation measures. 
 
6.  Subject to paragraph 3: 
29-6  
 
(a)  Article 10.3 (National Treatment) and Article 11.6.1 (Cross-Border 
Trade)  shall  apply  to  taxation  measures  on  income,  on  capital 
gains, on the taxable capital of corporations, or on the value of an 
investment or property9 (but not on the transfer of that investment 
or  property),  that  relate  to  the  purchase  or  consumption  of 
particular services, except that nothing in this subparagraph shall 
prevent a Party from conditioning the receipt or continued receipt 
of an advantage that relates to the purchase or consumption of 
particular services on requirements to provide the service in its 
territory; 
 
(b)  Article  9.4  (National  Treatment),  Article  9.5  (Most-Favoured-
Nation Treatment), Article 10.3 (National Treatment), Article 10.4 
(Most-Favoured-Nation  Treatment),  Article  11.3  (National 
Treatment),  Article  11.4  (Most-Favoured-Nation  Treatment), 
Article  11.6.1  (Cross-Border  Trade)  and  Article  14.4  (Non-
Discriminatory Treatment of Digital Products) shall apply to all 
taxation measures, other than those on income, on capital gains, on 
the taxable capital of corporations, on the value of an investment or 
property9 (but not on the transfer of that investment or property), 
or  taxes  on  estates,  inheritances,  gifts  and  generation-skipping 
transfers; and 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
but nothing in the Articles referred to in subparagraphs (a), (b) and (c) shall apply 
to: 
 
(d)  any most-favoured-nation obligation with respect to an advantage 
accorded by a Party pursuant to a tax convention; 
 
(e)  a non-conforming provision of any existing taxation measure; 
 
(f)  the continuation or prompt renewal of a non-conforming provision 
of any existing taxation measure; 
                                                 
9  This is without prejudice to the methodology used to determine the value of such investment or 
property under Parties’ respective laws. 
29-7  
 
(g)  an  amendment  to  a  non-conforming  provision  of  any  existing 
taxation  measure  to  the  extent  that  the  amendment  does  not 
decrease its conformity, at the time of the amendment, with any of 
those Articles; 
 
(h)  the adoption or enforcement of any new taxation measure aimed at 
ensuring  the  equitable  or  effective  imposition  or  collection  of 
taxes, including any taxation measure that differentiates between 
persons  based  on  their  place  of  residence  for  tax  purposes, 
provided that the taxation measure does not arbitrarily discriminate 
between persons, goods or services of the Parties;10 
 
(i)  a provision that conditions the receipt or continued receipt of an 
advantage relating to the contributions to, or income of, a pension 
trust, pension plan, superannuation fund or other arrangement to 
provide  pension,  superannuation  or  similar  benefits,  on  a 
requirement  that  the  Party  maintain  continuous  jurisdiction, 
regulation  or  supervision  over  that  trust,  plan,  fund  or  other 
arrangement; or 
 
(j)  any excise duty on insurance premiums to the extent that such tax 
would, if levied by the other Parties, be covered by subparagraph 
(e), (f) or (g). 
     
7.  Subject to paragraph 3, and without prejudice to the rights and obligations 
of the Parties under paragraph  5, Article 9.10.2 (Performance Requirements), 
Article 9.10.3 and Article 9.10.5 shall apply to taxation measures. 
 
8.  Article  9.8  (Expropriation  and  Compensation)  shall  apply  to  taxation 
measures.    However,  no  investor  may  invoke  Article  9.8  (Expropriation  and 
Compensation) as the basis for a claim if it has been determined pursuant to this 
paragraph that the measure is not an expropriation.  An investor that seeks to 
invoke Article 9.8 (Expropriation and Compensation) with respect to a taxation 
measure must first refer to the designated authorities of the Party of the investor 
and the respondent Party, at the time that it gives its notice of intent under Article 
9.19 (Submission of a Claim to Arbitration), the issue of whether that taxation 
measure is not an expropriation.  If the designated authorities do not agree to 
consider the issue or, having agreed to consider it, fail to agree that the measure is 
not an expropriation within a period of six months of the referral, the investor may 
submit its claim to arbitration under Article  9.19 (Submission of a Claim to 
Arbitration). 
 
                                                 
10  The Parties understand that this subparagraph must be interpreted by reference to the footnote 
to Article XIV(d) of GATS as if the Article was not restricted to services or direct taxes. 
29-8  
9.  Nothing in this Agreement shall prevent Singapore from adopting taxation 
measures no more trade restrictive than necessary to address Singapore’s public 
policy objectives arising out of its specific constraints of space. 
 
 
Article 29.5:  Tobacco Control Measures11 
 
  A  Party  may  elect  to  deny  the  benefits  of  Section  B  of  Chapter  9 
(Investment) with respect to claims challenging a tobacco control measure12 of the 
Party.  Such a claim shall not be submitted to arbitration under Section B of 
Chapter 9 (Investment) if a Party has made such an election.  If a Party has not 
elected to deny benefits with respect to such claims by the time of the submission 
of such a claim to arbitration under Section B of Chapter 9 (Investment), a Party 
may elect to deny benefits during the proceedings.  For greater certainty, if a Party 
elects  to  deny benefits  with  respect  to  such claims, any such claim  shall be 
dismissed. 
 
 
Article 29.6:  Treaty of Waitangi 
 
1.   Provided  that  such  measures  are  not  used  as  a  means  of  arbitrary  or 
unjustified discrimination against persons of the other Parties or as a disguised 
restriction on trade in goods, trade in services and investment, nothing in this 
Agreement shall preclude the adoption by New Zealand of measures it deems 
necessary to accord more favourable treatment to Maori in respect of matters 
covered by this Agreement, including in fulfilment of its obligations under the 
Treaty of Waitangi. 
 
2.   The  Parties  agree  that  the  interpretation  of  the  Treaty  of  Waitangi, 
including as to the nature of the rights and obligations arising under it, shall not be 
subject  to  the  dispute  settlement  provisions  of  this  Agreement.    Chapter  28 
(Dispute Settlement) shall otherwise apply to this Article.  A panel established 
under Article 28.7 (Establishment of a Panel) may be requested to determine only 
whether any measure referred to in paragraph 1 is inconsistent with a Party’s 
rights under this Agreement. 
 
 
                                                 
11  For greater certainty, this Article does not prejudice: (i) the operation of Article 9.15 (Denial of 
Benefits); or (ii) a Party’s rights under Chapter 28 (Dispute Settlement) in relation to a tobacco 
control measure.  
 
12 A tobacco control measure means a measure of a Party related to the production or consumption 
of manufactured tobacco products (including products made or derived from tobacco), their 
distribution, labelling, packaging, advertising, marketing, promotion, sale, purchase, or use, as 
well as enforcement measures, such as inspection, recordkeeping, and reporting requirements.  For 
greater certainty, a measure with respect to tobacco leaf that is not in the possession of a 
manufacturer of tobacco products or that is not part of a manufactured tobacco product is not a 
tobacco control measure. 
29-9  
Section B:  General Provisions 
 
 
Article 29.7:  Disclosure of Information 
   
Nothing in this Agreement shall be construed to require a Party to furnish 
or allow access to information, the disclosure of which would be contrary to its 
law or would impede law enforcement, or otherwise be contrary to the public 
interest,  or  which  would  prejudice  the  legitimate  commercial  interests  of 
particular enterprises, public or private. 
 
 
Article 29.8:  Traditional Knowledge and Traditional Cultural Expressions 
 
  Subject to each Party’s international obligations, each Party may establish 
appropriate measures to respect, preserve and promote traditional knowledge and 
traditional cultural expressions. 
 
29-10
