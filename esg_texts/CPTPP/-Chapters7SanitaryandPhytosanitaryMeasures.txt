SANITARY AND PHYTOSANITARY MEASURES 
 
 
Article 7.1:  Definitions 
 
1.  The definitions in Annex A of the SPS Agreement are incorporated into 
this Chapter and shall form part of this Chapter, mutatis mutandis. 
 
2.  In addition, for the purposes of this Chapter:  
 
competent authority means a government body of each Party responsible for 
measures and matters referred to in this Chapter; 
 
emergency measure means a sanitary or phytosanitary measure that is applied by 
an importing Party to another Party to address an urgent problem of human, 
animal or plant life or health protection that arises or threatens to arise in the Party 
applying the measure; 
 
import  check  means  an  inspection,  examination,  sampling,  review  of 
documentation, test or procedure, including laboratory, organoleptic or identity, 
conducted at the border by an importing Party or its representative to determine if 
a consignment complies1 with the sanitary and phytosanitary requirements of the 
importing Party;  
 
import  programme  means  mandatory  sanitary  or  phytosanitary  policies, 
procedures or requirements of an importing Party that govern the importation of 
goods; 
 
primary  representative  means  the  government  body  of  a  Party  that  is 
responsible for the implementation of this Chapter and the coordination of that 
Party’s participation in Committee activities under Article 7.5 (Committee on 
Sanitary and Phytosanitary Measures); 
 
risk  analysis  means  the  process  that  consists  of  three  components:  risk 
assessment; risk management; and risk communication; 
 
risk communication means the exchange of information and opinions concerning 
risk and risk-related factors between risk assessors, risk managers, consumers and 
other interested parties; and 
 
                                                 
1  For greater certainty, the Parties recognise that import checks are one of many tools available to 
assess compliance with an importing Party’s sanitary and phytosanitary measures. 
7-1  
risk management means the weighing of policy alternatives in light of the results 
of  risk  assessment  and,  if  required,  selecting  and  implementing  appropriate 
control options, including regulatory measures.

issues; 
 
(b)  reinforce and build on the SPS Agreement; 
 
(c)  strengthen communication, consultation and cooperation between 
the  Parties,  and  particularly  between  the  Parties’  competent 
authorities and primary representatives; 
 
(d)  ensure that sanitary or phytosanitary measures implemented by a 
Party do not create unjustified obstacles to trade;  
 
(e)  enhance transparency in and understanding of the application of 
each Party’s sanitary and phytosanitary measures; and  
 
(f)  encourage  the  development  and  adoption  of  international

7-2  
 
Article 7.5:  Committee on Sanitary and Phytosanitary Measures 
 
1.  For the purposes of the effective implementation and operation of this 
Chapter, the Parties hereby establish a Committee on Sanitary and Phytosanitary 
Measures (Committee), composed of government representatives of each Party 
responsible for sanitary and phytosanitary matters. 
 
2.  The objectives of the Committee are to:  
 
(a)  enhance each Party’s implementation of this Chapter;  
 
(b)  consider sanitary and phytosanitary matters of mutual interest; and 
 
(c)  enhance  communication  and  cooperation  on  sanitary  and 
phytosanitary matters.  
 
3.  The Committee: 
 
(a)  shall provide a forum to improve the Parties’ understanding of 
sanitary and phytosanitary issues that relate to the implementation 
of the SPS Agreement and this Chapter; 
 
(b)  shall provide a forum to enhance mutual understanding of each 
Party’s  sanitary  and  phytosanitary  measures  and  the  regulatory 
processes that relate to those measures; 
 
(c)  shall exchange information on the implementation of this Chapter;  
 
(d)  shall determine the appropriate means, which may include ad hoc 
working groups, to undertake specific tasks related to the functions 
of the Committee; 
 
(e)  may  identify  and  develop  technical  assistance  and  cooperation 
projects  between  the  Parties  on  sanitary  and  phytosanitary 
measures; 
 
(f)  may serve as a forum for a Party to share information on a sanitary 
or phytosanitary issue that has arisen between it and another Party 
or Parties, provided that the Parties between which the issue has 
arisen have first attempted to address the issue through discussions 
between themselves; and 
 
(g)  may  consult  on  matters  and  positions  for  the  meetings  of  the 
Committee  on  Sanitary  and  Phytosanitary  Measures  established 
under Article 12 of the SPS Agreement (WTO SPS Committee), 
and meetings held under the auspices of the Codex Alimentarius 
7-3  
Commission, the World Organisation for Animal Health and the 
International Plant Protection Convention. 
 
4.  The Committee shall establish its terms of reference at its first meeting and 
may revise those terms as needed.  
 
5.  The Committee shall meet within one year of the date of entry into force 
of this Agreement and once a year thereafter unless Parties agree otherwise. 
 
 
Article 7.6:  Competent Authorities and Contact Points 
 
  Each Party shall provide the other Parties with a written description of the 
sanitary and phytosanitary responsibilities of its competent authorities and contact 
points within each of these authorities and identify its primary representative 
within 60 days of the date of entry into force of this Agreement for that Party.  
Each Party shall keep this information up to date. 
 
 
Article 7.7:  Adaptation to Regional Conditions, Including Pest- or Disease-
Free Areas and Areas of Low Pest or Disease Prevalence 
 
1.  The  Parties  recognise  that  adaptation  to  regional  conditions,  including 
regionalisation,  zoning  and  compartmentalisation,  is  an  important  means  to 
facilitate trade.   
 
2.  The Parties shall take into account the relevant guidance of the WTO SPS 
Committee and international standards, guidelines and recommendations.  
 
3.  The Parties may  cooperate on the recognition  of pest- or disease-free 
areas, and areas of low pest or disease prevalence with the objective of acquiring 
confidence in the procedures followed by each Party for the recognition of pest- 
or disease-free areas, and areas of low pest or disease prevalence.  
 
4.  When an importing Party receives a request for a determination of regional 
conditions from an exporting Party and determines that the information provided 
by  the  exporting  Party  is  sufficient,  it  shall  initiate  an  assessment  within  a 
reasonable period of time. 
 
5.  When an importing Party commences an assessment of a request for a 
determination of regional conditions under paragraph 4, that Party shall promptly, 
on request of the exporting Party, explain its process for making the determination 
of regional conditions.  
 
6.  On request of the exporting Party, the importing Party shall inform the 
exporting Party of the status of the assessment of the exporting Party’s request for 
a determination of regional conditions.   
7-4  
 
7.  When  an  importing  Party  adopts  a  measure  that  recognises  specific 
regional conditions of an exporting Party, the importing Party shall communicate 
that measure to the exporting Party in writing and implement the measure within a 
reasonable period of time.  
 
8.  The importing and exporting Parties involved in a particular determination 
may also decide in advance the risk management measures that will apply to trade 
between them in the event of a change in the status.   
 
9.  The Parties involved in a determination recognising regional conditions 
are encouraged, if mutually agreed, to report the outcome to the Committee.  
 
10.  If the evaluation of the evidence provided by the exporting Party does not 
result in a determination to recognise pest- or disease-free areas, or areas of low 
pest and disease prevalence, the importing Party shall provide the exporting Party 
with the rationale for its determination. 
 
11.  If there is an incident that results in the importing Party modifying or 
revoking the determination recognising regional conditions,  on request of the 
exporting  Party,  the  Parties  involved  shall  cooperate  to  assess  whether  the 
determination can be reinstated.  
 
 
Article 7.8:  Equivalence 
 
1.  The Parties acknowledge that recognition of the equivalence of sanitary 
and phytosanitary measures is an important means to facilitate trade.  Further to 
Article 4 of the SPS Agreement, the Parties shall apply equivalence to a group of 
measures or on a systems-wide basis, to the extent feasible and appropriate.  In 
determining  the  equivalence  of  a  specific  sanitary  or  phytosanitary  measure, 
group of measures or on a systems-wide basis, each Party shall take into account 
the relevant guidance of the WTO SPS Committee and international standards, 
guidelines and recommendations.  
 
2.  On request of the exporting Party, the importing Party shall explain the 
objective  and  rationale  of  its  sanitary  or  phytosanitary  measure  and  clearly 
identify the risk the sanitary or phytosanitary measure is intended to address. 
 
3.  When an importing Party receives a request for an equivalence assessment 
and determines that the information provided by the exporting Party is sufficient, 
it shall initiate the equivalence assessment within a reasonable period of time. 
 
4.  When  an  importing  Party  commences  an  equivalence  assessment,  that 
Party shall promptly, on request of the exporting Party, explain its equivalence 
process  and  plan  for  making  the  equivalence  determination  and,  if  the 
determination results in recognition, for enabling trade. 
7-5  
 
5.  In determining the equivalence of a sanitary or phytosanitary measure, an 
importing Party shall take into account available knowledge, information and 
relevant experience, as well as the regulatory competence of the exporting Party.  
 
6.  The  importing  Party  shall  recognise  the  equivalence  of  a  sanitary  or 
phytosanitary  measure  if  the  exporting  Party  objectively  demonstrates  to  the 
importing Party that the exporting Party’s measure: 
 
(a)  achieves  the  same  level  of  protection  as  the  importing  Party’s 
measure; or 
 
(b)  has the same effect in achieving the objective as the importing 
Party’s measure.2 
 
7.  When an importing Party adopts a measure that recognises the equivalence 
of  an  exporting  Party’s  specific  sanitary  or  phytosanitary  measure,  group  of 
measures  or  measures  on  a  systems-wide  basis,  the  importing  Party  shall 
communicate the measure it has adopted to the exporting Party in writing and 
implement the measure within a reasonable period of time. 
 
8.  The  Parties  involved  in  an  equivalence  determination  that  results  in 
recognition are encouraged,  if mutually agreed, to  report the outcome to  the 
Committee. 
 
9.  If  an  equivalence  determination  does  not  result  in  recognition  by  the 
importing Party, the importing Party shall provide the exporting Party with the 
rationale for its decision. 
 
 
Article 7.9:  Science and Risk Analysis 
 
1.  The  Parties  recognise  the  importance  of  ensuring  that  their  respective 
sanitary and phytosanitary measures are based on scientific principles. 
 
2.  Each Party shall ensure that its sanitary and phytosanitary measures either 
conform to the relevant international standards, guidelines or recommendations 
or, if its sanitary and phytosanitary measures do not conform to international 
standards, guidelines or recommendations, that they are based on documented and 
objective  scientific  evidence  that  is  rationally  related  to  the  measures,  while 
recognising the Parties’ obligations regarding assessment of risk under Article 5 
of the SPS Agreement.3 
                                                 
2  No Party shall have recourse to dispute settlement under Chapter 28 (Dispute Settlement) for 
this subparagraph. 
 
3  No Party shall have recourse to dispute settlement under Chapter 28 (Dispute Settlement) for 
this paragraph. 
7-6  
 
3.  Recognising  the  Parties’  rights  and  obligations  under  the  relevant 
provisions of the SPS Agreement, nothing in this Chapter shall be construed to 
prevent a Party from: 
 
(a)  establishing the level of protection it determines to be appropriate; 
 
(b)  establishing or maintaining an approval procedure that requires a 
risk analysis to be conducted before the Party grants a product 
access to its market; or  
 
(c)  adopting or maintaining a sanitary or phytosanitary measure on a 
provisional basis. 
 
4.  Each Party shall:  
 
(a)  ensure  that  its  sanitary  and  phytosanitary  measures  do  not 
arbitrarily  or  unjustifiably  discriminate  between  Parties  where 
identical or similar conditions prevail, including between its own 
territory and that of other Parties; and 
 
(b)  conduct its risk analysis in a manner that is documented and that 
provides  interested  persons  and  other  Parties  an  opportunity  to 
comment, in a manner to be determined by that Party.4 
 
5.  Each Party shall ensure that each risk assessment it conducts is appropriate 
to  the  circumstances  of  the  risk  at  issue  and  takes  into  account  reasonably 
available  and  relevant  scientific  data,  including  qualitative  and  quantitative 
information. 
 
6.  When conducting its risk analysis, each Party shall: 
 
(a)  take into account relevant guidance of the WTO SPS Committee 
and international standards, guidelines and recommendations; 
 
(b)  consider  risk  management  options  that  are  not  more  trade 
restrictive5 than required, including the facilitation of trade by not 
taking any measure, to achieve the level of protection that the Party 
has determined to be appropriate; and 
 
                                                 
4  For greater certainty, this subparagraph applies only to a risk analysis for a sanitary or 
phytosanitary measure that constitutes a sanitary or phytosanitary regulation for the purposes of 
Annex B of the SPS Agreement. 
 
5  For the purposes of subparagraphs (b) and (c), a risk management option is not more trade-
restrictive than required unless there is another option reasonably available, taking into account 
technical and economic feasibility, that achieves the appropriate level of sanitary or phytosanitary 
protection and is significantly less restrictive to trade.  
7-7  
(c)  select a risk management option that is not more trade restrictive 
than required to achieve the sanitary or phytosanitary objective, 
taking into account technical and economic feasibility. 
 
7.  If an importing Party requires a risk analysis to evaluate a request from an 
exporting Party to authorise importation of a good of that exporting Party, the 
importing Party shall provide, on request of the exporting Party, an explanation of 
the information required for the risk assessment.  On receipt of the required 
information from the exporting Party, the importing Party shall endeavour to 
facilitate the evaluation of the request for authorisation by scheduling work on this 
request  in  accordance  with  the  procedures,  policies,  resources,  and  laws  and 
regulations of the importing Party. 
 
8.  On request of the exporting Party, the importing Party shall inform the 
exporting Party of the progress of a specific risk analysis request, and of any delay 
that may occur during the process. 
 
9.  If the importing Party, as a result of a risk analysis, adopts a sanitary or 
phytosanitary measure that allows trade to commence or resume, the importing 
Party shall implement the measure within a reasonable period of time.  
 
10.  Without prejudice to Article 7.14 (Emergency Measures), no Party shall 
stop the importation of a good of another Party solely for the reason that the 
importing Party is undertaking a review of its sanitary or phytosanitary measure, 
if the importing Party permitted the importation of that good of the other Party 
when the review was initiated. 
 
 
Article 7.10:  Audits6 
 
1.  To determine an exporting Party’s ability to provide required assurances 
and meet the sanitary and phytosanitary measures of the importing Party, each 
importing Party shall have the right, subject to this Article, to audit the exporting 
Party’s competent authorities and associated or designated inspection systems.  
That  audit  may  include  an  assessment  of  the  competent  authorities’  control 
programmes,  including:  if  appropriate,  reviews  of  the  inspection  and  audit 
programmes; and on-site inspections of facilities. 
 
2.  An audit shall be systems-based and designed to check the effectiveness of 
the regulatory controls of the competent authorities of the exporting Party. 
 
                                                 
6  For greater certainty, nothing in this Article prevents an importing Party from performing an 
inspection of a facility for the purposes of determining if the facility conforms with the importing 
Party’s sanitary or phytosanitary requirements or conforms with sanitary or phytosanitary 
requirements that the importing Party has determined to be equivalent to its sanitary or 
phytosanitary requirements. 
7-8  
3.  In undertaking an audit, a Party shall take into account relevant guidance 
of  the  WTO  SPS  Committee  and  international  standards,  guidelines  and 
recommendations. 
 
4.  Prior to the commencement of an audit, the importing Party and exporting 
Party involved shall discuss the rationale and decide: the objectives and scope of 
the audit; the criteria or requirements against which the exporting Party will be 
assessed; and the itinerary and procedures for conducting the audit. 
 
5.  The  auditing  Party  shall  provide  the  audited  Party  the  opportunity  to 
comment on the findings of the audit and take any such comments into account 
before  the  auditing  Party  makes  its  conclusions  and  takes  any  action.    The 
auditing Party shall provide a report setting out its conclusions in writing to the 
audited Party within a reasonable period of time. 
 
6.  A decision or action taken by the auditing Party as a result of the audit 
shall be supported by objective evidence and data that can be verified, taking into 
account  the  auditing  Party’s  knowledge  of,  relevant  experience  with,  and 
confidence  in,  the  audited  Party.    This  objective  evidence  and  data  shall  be 
provided to the audited Party on request. 
 
7.  The costs incurred by the auditing Party shall be borne by the auditing 
Party, unless both Parties decide otherwise. 
 
8.  The auditing Party and audited Party shall each ensure that procedures are 
in place to prevent the disclosure of confidential information that is acquired 
during the audit process. 
 
 
Article 7.11:  Import Checks 
 
1.  Each Party shall ensure that its import programmes are based on the risks 
associated with importations, and the import checks are carried out without undue 
delay.7 
 
2.  A Party shall make available to another Party, on request, information on 
its import procedures and its basis for determining the nature and frequency of 
import checks, including the factors it considers to determine the risks associated 
with importations. 
 
3.  A Party may amend the frequency of its import checks as a result of 
experience gained through import checks or as a result of actions or discussions 
provided for in this Chapter. 
 
                                                 
7  For greater certainty, nothing in this Article prohibits a Party from performing import checks to 
obtain information to assess risk or to determine the need for, develop or periodically review a 
risk-based import programme.   
7-9  
4.  An importing Party shall provide to another Party, on request, information 
regarding  the  analytical  methods,  quality  controls,  sampling  procedures  and 
facilities that the importing Party uses to test a good.  The importing Party shall 
ensure that any testing is conducted using appropriate and validated methods in a 
facility that operates under a quality assurance programme that is consistent with 
international laboratory standards.  The importing Party shall maintain physical or 
electronic  documentation  regarding  the  identification,  collection,  sampling, 
transportation and storage of the test sample, and the analytical methods used on 
the test sample. 
 
5.  An importing Party shall ensure that its final decision in response to a 
finding of non-conformity with the importing Party’s sanitary or phytosanitary 
measure, is limited to what is reasonable and necessary, and is rationally related to 
the available science. 
 
6.  If an importing Party prohibits or restricts the importation of a good of 
another Party on the basis of an adverse result of an import check, the importing 
Party shall provide a notification about the adverse result to at least one of the 
following:  the  importer  or  its  agent;  the  exporter;  the  manufacturer;  or  the 
exporting Party.  
 
7.  When the importing Party provides a notification pursuant to paragraph 6, 
it shall: 
 
(a)  include: 
 
(i)  the reason for the prohibition or restriction;  
 
(ii)  the legal basis or authorisation for the action; and  
 
(iii)  information  on  the  status  of  the  affected  goods  and,  if 
appropriate, on their disposition;  
 
(b)  do  so  in  a  manner  consistent  with  its  laws,  regulations  and 
requirements as soon as possible and no later than seven days8 after 
the date of the decision to prohibit or restrict, unless the good is 
seized by a customs administration; and 
 
(c)  if the notification has not already been provided through another 
channel,  transmit  the  notification  by  electronic  means,  if 
practicable. 
 
8.  An importing Party that prohibits or restricts the importation of a good of 
another Party on the basis of an adverse result of an import check shall provide an 
opportunity for a review of the decision and consider any relevant information 
                                                 
8  For the purposes of this paragraph, the term “days” does not include national holidays of the 
importing Party. 
7-10  
submitted to assist in the review.  The review request and information should be 
submitted to the importing Party within a reasonable period of time.9 
 
9.  If an importing Party determines that there is a significant, sustained or 
recurring pattern of non-conformity with a sanitary or phytosanitary measure, the 
importing Party shall notify the exporting Party of the non-conformity. 
 
10.  On  request,  an  importing  Party  shall  provide  to  the  exporting  Party 
available information on goods from the exporting Party that were found not to 
conform to a sanitary or phytosanitary measure of the importing Party.  
 
 
Article 7.12:  Certification 
 
1.  The  Parties  recognise  that  assurances  with  respect  to  sanitary  or 
phytosanitary requirements may be provided through means other than certificates 
and  that  different  systems  may  be  capable  of  meeting  the  same  sanitary  or 
phytosanitary objective. 
 
2.  If an importing Party requires certification for trade in a good, the Party 
shall ensure that the certification requirement is applied, in meeting the Party’s 
sanitary  or  phytosanitary  objectives,  only  to  the  extent  necessary  to  protect 
human, animal or plant life or health.  
 
3.  In applying certification requirements, an importing Party shall take into 
account  relevant  guidance  of  the  WTO  SPS  Committee  and  international 
standards, guidelines and recommendations. 
 
4.  An importing Party shall limit attestations and information it requires on 
the  certificates  to  essential  information  that  is  related  to  the  sanitary  or 
phytosanitary objectives of the importing Party. 
 
5.  An  importing  Party  should  provide  to  another  Party,  on  request,  the 
rationale for any attestations or information that the importing Party requires to be 
included on a certificate. 
 
6.  The Parties may agree to work cooperatively to develop model certificates 
to  accompany  specific  goods  traded  between  the  Parties,  taking  into account 
relevant  guidance  of  the  WTO  SPS  Committee  and  international  standards, 
guidelines and recommendations. 
 
7.  The Parties shall promote the implementation of electronic certification 
and other technologies to facilitate trade. 
 
                                                 
9  For greater certainty, nothing in this Article prevents an importing Party from disposing of goods 
which are found to have an infectious pathogen or pest that, if urgent action is not taken, can 
spread and cause damage to human, animal or plant life or health in the Party’s territory. 
7-11  
 
Article 7.13:  Transparency10 
 
1.  The Parties recognise the value of sharing information about their sanitary 
and phytosanitary measures on an ongoing basis, and of providing interested 
persons and other Parties with the opportunity to comment on their proposed 
sanitary and phytosanitary measures. 
 
2.  In implementing this Article, each Party shall take into account relevant 
guidance of the WTO SPS Committee and international standards, guidelines and 
recommendations. 
 
3.  A Party shall notify a proposed sanitary or phytosanitary measure that may 
have an effect on the trade of another Party, including any that conforms to 
international standards, guidelines or recommendations, by using the WTO SPS 
notification submission system as a means of notifying the other Parties.  
 
4.  Unless urgent problems of human, animal or plant life or health protection 
arise or threaten to arise, or the measure is of a trade-facilitating nature, a Party 
shall normally allow at least 60 days for interested persons and other Parties to 
provide written comments on the proposed measure after it makes the notification 
under paragraph 3.  If feasible and appropriate, the Party should allow more than 
60 days.  The Party shall consider any reasonable request from an interested 
person or another Party to extend the comment period.  On request of another 
Party, the Party shall respond to the written comments of the other Party in an 
appropriate manner. 
 
5.  The Party shall make available to the public, by electronic means in an 
official journal or on a website, the proposed sanitary or phytosanitary measure 
notified  under  paragraph  3,  the  legal  basis  for  the  measure,  and  the  written 
comments or a summary of the written comments that the Party has received from 
the public on the measure.   
 
6.  If a Party proposes a sanitary or phytosanitary measure which does not 
conform to an international standard, guideline or recommendation, the Party shall 
provide  to  another  Party,  on  request,  and  to  the  extent  permitted  by  the 
confidentiality  and  privacy  requirements  of  the  Party’s  law,  the  relevant 
documentation that the Party considered in developing the proposed measure, 
including documented and objective scientific evidence that is rationally related to 
the measure, such as risk assessments, relevant studies and expert opinions. 
 
7.  A Party that proposes to adopt a sanitary or phytosanitary measure shall 
discuss  with  another  Party,  on  request  and  if  appropriate  and  feasible,  any 
scientific or trade concerns that the other Party may raise regarding the proposed 
                                                 
10  For greater certainty, this Article applies only to a sanitary or phytosanitary measure that 
constitutes a sanitary or phytosanitary regulation for the purposes of Annex B of the SPS 
Agreement. 
7-12  
measure and the availability of alternative, less trade-restrictive approaches for 
achieving the objective of the measure.  
 
8.  Each Party shall publish, preferably by electronic means, notices of final 
sanitary or phytosanitary measures in an official journal or website. 
 
9.  Each Party shall notify the other Parties of final sanitary or phytosanitary 
measures through the WTO SPS notification submission system.  Each Party shall 
ensure that the text or the notice of a final sanitary or phytosanitary measure 
specifies the date on which the measure takes effect and the legal basis for the 
measure.  A Party shall also make available to another Party, on request, and to 
the extent permitted by the confidentiality and privacy requirements of the Party’s 
law,  significant  written  comments  and  relevant  documentation  considered  to 
support the measure that were received during the comment period. 
 
10.  If a final sanitary or phytosanitary measure is substantively altered from 
the proposed measure, a Party shall also include in the notice of the final sanitary 
or phytosanitary measure that it publishes, an explanation of:   
 
(a)  the objective and rationale of the measure and how the measure 
advances that objective and rationale; and  
 
(b)  any substantive revisions that it made to the proposed measure.   
 
11.  An exporting Party shall notify the importing Party through the contact 
points referred to in Article 7.6 (Competent Authorities and Contact Points) in a 
timely and appropriate manner: 
 
(a)  if it has knowledge of a significant sanitary or phytosanitary risk 
related to the export of a good from its territory; 
 
(b)  of urgent situations where a change in animal or plant health status 
in the territory of the exporting Party may affect current trade; 
 
(c)  of significant changes in the status of a regionalised pest or disease; 
 
(d)  of new scientific findings of importance which affect the regulatory 
response with respect to food safety, pests or diseases; and 
 
(e)  of significant changes in food safety, pest or disease management, 
control or eradication policies or practices that may affect current 
trade. 
 
12.  If feasible and appropriate, a Party should provide an interval of more than 
six months between the date it publishes a final sanitary or phytosanitary measure 
and the date on which the measure takes effect, unless the measure is intended to 
7-13  
address an urgent problem of human, animal or plant life or health protection or 
the measure is of a trade-facilitating nature. 
 
13.  A  Party  shall  provide  to  another  Party,  on  request,  all  sanitary  or 
phytosanitary measures related to the importation of a  good into that Party’s 
territory. 
 
 
Article 7.14:  Emergency Measures 
 
1.  If a Party adopts an emergency measure that is necessary for the protection 
of human, animal or plant life or health, the Party shall promptly notify the other 
Parties of that measure through the primary representative and the relevant contact 
point referred to in Article 7.6 (Competent Authorities and Contact Points).  The 
Party  that  adopts  the  emergency  measure  shall  take  into  consideration  any 
information provided by other Parties in response to the notification. 
 
2.  If a Party adopts an emergency measure, it shall review the scientific basis 
of that measure within six months and make available the results of the review to 
any Party on request.  If the emergency measure is maintained after the review, 
because the reason for its adoption remains, the Party should review the measure 
periodically. 
 
 
Article 7.15:  Cooperation 
 
1.  The  Parties  shall  explore  opportunities  for  further  cooperation, 
collaboration  and  information  exchange  between  the  Parties  on  sanitary  and 
phytosanitary matters of mutual interest, consistent with this Chapter.  Those 
opportunities may include trade facilitation initiatives and technical assistance.  
The Parties shall cooperate to facilitate the implementation of this Chapter. 
 
2.  The Parties shall cooperate and may jointly identify work on sanitary and 
phytosanitary matters with the goal of eliminating unnecessary obstacles to trade 
between the Parties.  
 
 
Article 7.16:  Information Exchange 
 
  A Party may request information from another Party on a matter arising 
under  this  Chapter.    A  Party  that  receives  a  request  for  information  shall 
endeavour  to  provide  available  information  to  the  requesting  Party  within  a 
reasonable period of time, and if possible, by electronic means. 
 
 
 
 
7-14  
 
Article 7.17:  Cooperative Technical Consultations  
 
1.  If a Party has concerns regarding any matter arising under this Chapter 
with  another  Party,  it  shall  endeavour  to  resolve  the  matter  by  using  the 
administrative procedures that the other Party’s competent authority has available.  
If the relevant Parties have bilateral or other mechanisms available to address the 
matter, the Party raising the matter shall endeavour to resolve the matter through 
those mechanisms, if it considers that it is appropriate to do so.  A Party may have 
recourse to the Cooperative Technical Consultations (CTC) set out in paragraph 2 
at any time it considers that the continued use of the administrative procedures or 
bilateral or other mechanisms would not resolve the matter. 
 
2.  One or more Parties (requesting Party) may initiate CTC with another 
Party (responding Party) to discuss any matter arising under this Chapter that the 
requesting Party considers may adversely affect its trade by delivering a request to 
the primary representative of the responding Party.  The request shall be in writing 
and identify the reason for the request, including a description of the requesting 
Party’s concerns about the matter, and set out the provisions of this Chapter that 
relate to the matter.   
 
3.  Unless  the  requesting  Party  and  the  responding  Party  (the  consulting 
Parties) agree otherwise, the responding Party shall acknowledge the request in 
writing within seven days of the date of its receipt.   
 
4.  Unless the consulting Parties agree otherwise, the consulting Parties shall 
meet within 30 days of the responding Party’s acknowledgement of the request to 
discuss the matter identified in the request, with the aim of resolving the matter 
within 180 days of the request if possible.  The meeting shall be in person or by 
electronic means. 
 
5.  The consulting Parties shall ensure the appropriate involvement of relevant 
trade and regulatory agencies in meetings held pursuant to this Article. 
 
6.  All communications between the consulting Parties in the course of CTC, 
as well as all documents generated for CTC, shall be kept confidential unless the 
consulting  Parties  agree  otherwise  and  without  prejudice  to  the  rights  and 
obligations of any Party under this Agreement, the WTO Agreement or any other 
international agreement to which it is a party. 
 
7.  The requesting Party may cease CTC proceedings under this Article and 
have recourse to dispute settlement under Chapter 28 (Dispute Settlement) if:   
 
(a)  the meeting referred to in paragraph 4 does not take place within 37 
days of the date of the request, or such other timeframe as the 
consulting Parties may agree under paragraphs 3 and 4; or 
 
7-15  
(b)  the meeting referred to in paragraph 4 has been held. 
 
8.  No  Party  shall  have  recourse  to  dispute  settlement  under  Chapter  28 
(Dispute Settlement) for a matter arising under this Chapter without first seeking 
to resolve the matter through CTC in accordance with this Article.  
 
 
Article 7.18:  Dispute Settlement 
 
1.  Unless  otherwise  provided  in  this  Chapter,  Chapter  28  (Dispute 
Settlement) shall apply to this Chapter, subject to the following:  
 
(a)  with respect to Article 7.8 (Equivalence), Article 7.10 (Audits) and 
Article  7.11  (Import  Checks),  Chapter  28  (Dispute  Settlement) 
shall apply with respect to a responding Party as of one year after 
the date of entry into force of this Agreement for that Party; and 
 
(b)  with respect to Article 7.9 (Science and Risk Analysis), Chapter 28 
(Dispute Settlement) shall apply with respect to a responding Party 
as of two years after the date of entry into force of this Agreement 
for that Party. 
 
2.  In a dispute under this Chapter that involves scientific or technical issues, 
a panel should seek advice from experts chosen by the panel in consultation with 
the Parties involved in the dispute.  To this end, the panel may, if it deems 
appropriate, establish an advisory technical experts group, or consult the relevant 
international standard setting organisations, at the request of either Party to the 
dispute or on its own initiative.
