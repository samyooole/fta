mechanisms  may  include  the  recognition  of  regulatory  outcomes,  whether 
accorded  autonomously  or  by  mutual  arrangement,  or  broader  international 
frameworks.  To this end, the Parties shall endeavour to exchange information on 
any such mechanisms applied in their jurisdictions and explore ways to extend 
these or other suitable arrangements to promote compatibility between them.

electronic means, including personal information, when this activity is for the 
conduct of the business of a covered person.

measures inconsistent  with paragraph 2 to  achieve a legitimate public policy 
objective, provided that the measure:
