revision of this Article and Annex 4B. 
 
 
ARTICLE 4.4 : OUTWARD PROCESSING 
 
1.  Notwithstanding the relevant provisions of Article 4.2 and the product-specific 
requirements set out in Annex 4A, a good listed in Annex 4C shall be considered as 
originating even if it has undergone processes of production or operation outside the 
territory of a Party on a material exported from the Party and subsequently re-imported 
to the Party, provided that:

4-1 The last process of production or operation does not exclude the non-qualifying operations stipulated 
in Article 4.16 
  
 
ARTICLE 4.5 : REGIONAL VALUE CONTENT 
 
  When a regional value content is required to determine an originating good, the 
regional value content of a good shall be calculated on the basis of the following 
method: 
 
 
              CV - VNM  
    RVC =    ---------------------- x 100 
  CV 
 
where 
 
RVC   is the regional value content, expressed as a percentage; 
 
CV     is the customs value adjusted to an F.O.B. basis; and 
 
VNM    is the value of non-originating materials used by the  
   producer in the production of the good. 
 
 
ARTICLE 4.6 : UNASSEMBLED OR DISASSEMBLED GOODS

disassembled form but is classified as an assembled good pursuant to the provisions of 
sub-paragraph (a) of paragraph 2 of the General Rule for the Interpretation of the 
Harmonized System shall be considered as an originating good, if the good meets the 
requirements of Article 4.2. 
 
 
ARTICLE 4.7 : INTERMEDIATE MATERIALS 
 
  Any self-produced material that is used in the production of a good may be 
designated by the producer of the good as an intermediate material for the purpose of 
calculating the regional value content of the good under Article 4.5, provided that where 
 the intermediate material is subject to a regional value content requirement, no other 
self-produced material subject to a regional value content requirement used in the 
production of that intermediate material may itself be designated by the producer as an 
intermediate material.  
 
 
ARTICLE 4.8 : NEUTRAL ELEMENTS 
 
In  order  to  determine  whether  a  good  originates  it  shall  not  be  necessary  to 
determine the origin of the following which might be used in its  production  and not

(a)  fuel and energy; 
(b) tools, dies and moulds; 
(c)  spare parts and materials used in the maintenance of equipment and buildings; 
(d)  lubricants,  greases,  compounding  materials  and  other  materials  used  in 
production or used to operate equipment and buildings; 
(e)  gloves, glasses, footwear, clothing, safety equipment and supplies;

production. 
 
 
ARTICLE 4.9 : ACCUMULATION 
 
1.  Originating materials from the territory of a Party incorporated in the production of 
a good in the territory of the other Party, shall be considered to originate in the territory 
of the other Party. 
 
2.  For the purpose of establishing that a good is originating, the producer of a good 
may accumulate one’s production with the production, in the territory of one or both of 
the Parties by one or more producers, of materials incorporated in the production of the 
good, so that the production of those materials is considered as done by that producer, 
provided that the good complies with the criteria set out in Article 4.2. 
 
 
 ARTICLE 4.10 : DE MINIMIS 
 
1.  A good that does not undergo a change in tariff classification pursuant to Annex 4A 
shall be considered as originating if: 
 
(a)  the value of all non-originating materials used in its production that do not 
undergo the required change in tariff classification does not exceed ten (10) 
per cent of the customs value of the good; and 
(b)  the good  meets all other applicable criteria set forth in this Chapter for 
qualifying as an originating good. 
 
  The value of such non-originating materials shall, however, be included in the 
value of non-originating materials for any applicable regional value content requirement 
for the good. 
 
2.   Paragraph 1 shall not apply to: 
 
(a)  a non-originating material used in the production of a good provided for in 
Chapters 1 through 14 of the Harmonized System; and 
(b)  a non-originating material used in the production of a good provided for in 
Chapters 15 through 24 of the Harmonized System unless the non-originating 
material is provided for in a different subheading from that of the good for 
which the origin is being determined under this Article. 
 
3.  A good provided for in Chapters 50 through 63 of the Harmonized System that is 
not an originating good, because certain fibres or yarns used in the production of the 
component of the good that determines the tariff classification of the good do not 
undergo  an  applicable  change  in  tariff  classification  set  out  in  Annex  4A,  shall 
nonetheless be considered as originating if the total weight of all such fibres or yarns in 
that component is not more than eight (8) per cent of the total weight of that component. 
 
 
ARTICLE 4.11 : FUNGIBLE GOODS AND MATERIALS 
 
1.  The determination of whether fungible goods or materials are originating goods 
shall be made either by physical segregation of each good or material or through the use 
of any of the inventory management method, such as averaging, last-in, first-out, or first 
 in, first-out, recognised in the Generally Accepted Accounting Principles of a Party in 
which the production is performed or otherwise accepted by the Party in which the 
production is performed. 
 
2.  Once a particular inventory management method is selected under paragraph 1, 
that method shall continue to be used for those fungible goods or materials throughout 
the fiscal year of the person that selected the inventory management method. 
 
 
ARTICLE 4.12 : ACCESSORIES, SPARE PARTS AND TOOLS 
 
1.  Accessories, spare parts, or tools, delivered with a good that form part of standard 
accessories, spare parts or tools of the good, shall be considered as originating if the 
good is an originating good, and shall be disregarded in determining whether all the 
non-originating materials used in the production of the good undergo the applicable 
change in tariff classification set out in Annex 4A, provided that: 
 
(a)  the accessories, spare parts or tools are not invoiced separately from the good; 
and 
(b)  the quantities and value of the accessories, spare parts or tools are customary 
for the good.  
  
2.   If the good is subject to a regional value-content requirement, the value of the 
accessories, spare parts or tools shall be taken into account as originating or non-
originating materials, as the case may be, in calculating the regional value content of the 
good. 
 
 
ARTICLE 4.13 : PACKAGING MATERIALS AND CONTAINERS FOR RETAIL SALE 
 
  Packaging materials and containers in which a good is packaged for retail sale 
shall, if classified with the good, be disregarded in determining whether all the non-
originating materials used in the production of the good undergo the applicable change 
in tariff classification set out in Annex 4A, and, if the good is subject to a regional value 
content requirement, the value of such packaging materials and containers shall be taken 
into  account  as  originating  or  non-originating  materials,  as  the  case  may  be,  in 
calculating the regional value content of the good. 
 ARTICLE 4.14 : PACKING MATERIALS AND CONTAINERS FOR SHIPMENT 
 
  Packing materials and containers in which a good is packed for shipment shall be 
disregarded in determining whether:  
 
(a)  the non-originating materials used in the production of the good undergo an 
applicable change in tariff classification set out in Annex 4A; and 
(b)  the good satisfies a regional value content requirement. 
 
 
ARTICLE 4.15 : DIRECT CONSIGNMENT 
 
  A good shall not be considered to be an originating good of a Party by reason of 
having  undergone  production  that  satisfies  the  requirements  of  Article  4.2,  if, 
subsequent to that production: 
 
(a)  the good is not transported directly to the territory of the other Party; or 
(b)  where  the  good  is  shipped  through  or  transshipped  in  the  territory  of  a 
country that is not a Party under this Agreement, the importer has failed to 
meet the requirements stipulated in paragraph (c) of Article 5.9.  
 
 
ARTICLE 4.16 : NON-QUALIFYING OPERATIONS 
 
    Notwithstanding any provision in this Chapter, a good shall not be considered to 
have satisfied the requirements for an originating good in Article 4.2 merely by reason 
of going through certain operations or processes including, inter alia, the following : 
 
(a)  operations to ensure the preservation of products in good condition during 
transport and storage (such as drying, freezing, keeping in brine) and other 
similar operations;
