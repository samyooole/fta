MOVEMENT OF NATURAL PERSONS 
 
 
ARTICLE 9.1:  GENERAL PRINCIPLES 
 
1.  This Chapter reflects the preferential trading relationship between the Parties, the 
Parties' mutual desire to facilitate temporary entry of natural persons on a comparable 
basis and of establishing transparent criteria and streamlined procedures for temporary 
entry, while recognizing the need to ensure border security. This Chapter provides for 
rights and obligations additional to those set out in Chapters 2, 6 and 7 in relation to the 
movement of natural persons between the Parties. 
 
2.  This Chapter shall not apply to measures pertaining to citizenship, permanent 
residence, or employment on a permanent basis.  
 
3.  Nothing contained in this Chapter shall prevent a Party from applying measures 
to regulate the entry or temporary stay of natural persons of the other Party in its 
territory, including measures necessary to protect the integrity of its territory and to 
ensure  the  orderly  movement  of  natural  persons  across  its  borders,  provided  such 
measures are not applied in a manner so as to unduly impair the benefits accruing to the 
other Party or delay trade in goods or services or conduct of investment activities under 
this Agreement.

line supervisor, unless the employees supervised are professionals, 
nor does this include an employee who primarily performs tasks 
necessary  for  the  provision  of  the  service  or  operation  of  an 
investment,  however, this does not prevent the manager, in the 
course  of  executing  his  duties  as  described  above,  from

service or operation of an investment; 
 
(ii)  executive  means  a  natural  person  within  an  organization  who

making direct sales to the general public or in supplying services directly; 
 
(h)   seller of goods means any person of a party engaged in the manufacture,

seeking temporary entry into the other Party in order to sell goods to, or to 
enter  into  a  distribution  or  retailing  arrangement  with  a  person  or  an 
enterprise  of  the  other  Party  engaged  in  an  industrial  or  commercial 
enterprise,  provided,  however,  that  such  person  shall  not  sell  goods 
directly to the general public of the other Party;

regulations  of  the  other  Party  to  provide  such  services  in  the 
territory of that Party;

only apply to the sectors in which specific commitments are undertaken by the concerned 
Party under Chapters 6 and 7 of this Agreement. However, they shall not apply to 
                                                 
9-1 For greater certainty, the Parties understand that in the case of a juridical person of a Party where the 
service supplier is also the sole employee, the term “representative of a service supplier” includes the 
service supplier who is seeking temporary entry into the other Party for the purpose of negotiating the sale 
of services, where such person will not be engaged in making direct sales to the general public or in 
supplying services directly.

of up to 90 days provided that the total sum of the initial period and the extended period

otherwise meets its criteria for the grant of an immigration visa, for an initial period of

(b)  Documentation  demonstrating  that  he  or  she  will  be  so  engaged  and 
describing the purpose of entry, including the letter of contract from the

the right to work as managers, executives or specialists (as defined in paragraphs 2(f)(i) 
to (iii) of Article 9.2), subject to its relevant licensing, administrative and registration 
requirements.    Such  spouses  or  dependants  can  apply  independently  in  their  own 
capacity (and not necessarily as accompanying spouses or dependants) and shall not be 
barred by the Party granting them the right to work from taking up employment in a 
category other than that of managers, executives, or specialists solely on the ground that 
they as the accompanying spouses or dependants are already employed in its territory as 
managers, executives or specialists.  
 
 
ARTICLE 9.7:  REGULATORY TRANSPARENCY 
 
1.  Each Party shall maintain or establish contact points or other mechanisms to

where they have encountered special difficulties in the process of seeking temporary 
entry in the other Party.   
 
2.  To  the  extent  possible,  each  Party  shall  allow  reasonable  time  between 
publication of regulations affecting the temporary entry of natural persons and their 
effective  date,  and  such  notification  to  the  other  Party  can  be  made  electronically 
available. 
 
3.  Prior  to  the  entry  into  force  of  this  Agreement,  the  Parties  shall  exchange 
information  on  current  procedures  relating  to  the  processing  of  applications  for 
temporary entry.  
 
ARTICLE 9.8:  IMMIGRATION MEASURES 
 
  Nothing in this Chapter shall prevent a Party from applying measures to regulate 
the  entry  of  natural  persons  of  the  other  Party  into,  or  their  temporary  stay  in,  its 
territory, including those measures necessary to protect the integrity of, and to ensure the 
orderly movement of natural persons across its borders, provided that such measures are 
not applied in such a manner as to nullify or impair the benefits accruing to the other 
Party under the terms of this Chapter. 
 
 
  79  
 
ARTICLE 9.9:  EXPEDITIOUS APPLICATIONS PROCEDURES 
 
Each Party shall process expeditiously applications for temporary entry from 
natural persons of the other Party, including requests for further extension, for grant of

ARTICLE 9.11:  RESOLUTION OF PROBLEMS 
 
  The relevant authorities of both Parties shall endeavor to favorably resolve any 
specific or general problems (within the framework of their domestic laws, regulations 
and other similar measures governing the temporary entry of natural persons) which may 
arise from the implementation and administration of this Chapter. 
 
 
ARTICLE 9.12:  DISPUTE SETTLEMENT 
 
1.  A Party may not initiate proceedings under Chapter 15 regarding a refusal to 
grant temporary entry under this chapter unless  
 
(a)  the matter involves a breach of any of the provisions relating to the right 
of entry accruing under this Chapter; 
  
(b)  involves a pattern of practice; and 
  
(c)  its natural persons affected by the pattern of practice have exhausted the 
available domestic administrative remedies of the other Party. 
 
2.  The remedies referred to in paragraph 1(c) shall be deemed to be exhausted if a 
final determination in the matter has not been issued by the competent authority within 
one year of the institution of proceedings for domestic administrative remedies including 
proceedings by way of review, and the failure to issue a determination is not attributable 
to the delay caused by the natural person.
