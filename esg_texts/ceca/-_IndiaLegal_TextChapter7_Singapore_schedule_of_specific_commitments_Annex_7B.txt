SINGAPORE’S SCHEDULE OF SPECIFIC COMMITMENTS 
 
EXPLANATORY NOTES 
 
1.  The  classification  of  service  sectors  in  this schedule  is  based  on  the  1991 
provisional Central Product Classification (CPC) of the United Nations Statistical 
Office unless otherwise indicated by the absence of a CPC number.  The ordering 
reflects  the  services  sectoral  classification  list  as  used  in  the  GATT  document 
MTN.GNS/W/120  dated  10  July  1991.    The  scheduling  of  specific  commitments 
follows  the  guidelines  stated  in  GATT  documents  MTN.GNS/W/164  dated  3 
September 1993 and MTN.GNS/W/164/Add.1 dated 30 November 1993.  
 
2.  The use of  “ ** ” against individual CPC codes indicates that the specific 
commitment for that code shall not extend to the total range of services covered 
under that code.  The entry “Unbound*” means unbound due to lack of technical 
feasibility. 
 
3.  Cabotage  services  in  the  maritime  transport  sector  are  not  listed  in  this 
Schedule, as Chapter 7 does not apply to those services.
