  3. Bilateral safeguard measures directed at imports from the other
  Party shall not exceed what is necessary to remedy the problems, as

  preferences provided for under this Agreement for the product
  concerned up to a maximum limit corresponding to the basic duty
  referred to in Article 3 paragraph 4(a) and (b) and paragraph 5 for

  period, at the latest, and shall not be taken for a period exceeding
  two years.

  In very exceptional circumstances, measures may be extended for a
  further period of maximum two years. No bilateral safeguard measure
  shall be applied to the import of a product that has previously been
  subject to such a measure for a period of, at least, 4 years since the
  expiry of the measure.

  4. In the cases specified in this Article, before taking the measures
  provided for therein or, in the cases to which paragraph 5(b) of this
  Article applies, as soon as possible, the Community on the one part or
  Montenegro on the other part, shall supply the Interim Committee with
  all relevant information required for a thorough examination of the
  situation, with a view to seeking a solution acceptable to the Parties
  concerned.

  5. For the implementation of the paragraphs 1, 2, 3 and 4 the
  following provisions shall apply:

  (a) The problems arising from the situation referred to in this
  Article shall be immediately referred for examination to the Interim
  Committee, which may take any decisions needed to put an end to such
  problems.

  If the Interim Committee or the exporting Party has not taken a
  decision putting an end to the problems, or no other satisfactory
  solution has been reached within 30 days of the matter being referred
  to the Interim Committee, the importing Party may adopt the
  appropriate measures to remedy the problem in accordance with this
  Article. In the selection of safeguard measures, priority must be
  given to those which least disturb the functioning of the arrangements
  established in this Agreement. Safeguard measures applied in
  accordance with Article XIX GATT 1994 and the WTO Agreement on
  Safeguards shall preserve the level/margin of preference granted under
  this Agreement.

  (b) Where exceptional and critical circumstances requiring immediate
  action make prior information or examination, as the case may be,
  impossible, the Party concerned may, in the situations specified in
  this Article, apply forthwith provisional measures necessary to deal
  with the situation and shall inform the other Party immediately
  thereof.

  The safeguard measures shall be notified immediately to the Interim
  Committee and shall be the subject of periodic consultations within
  that body, particularly with a view to establishing a timetable for
  their abolition as soon as circumstances permit.

  6. In the event of the Community on the one part or Montenegro on the
  other part subjecting imports of products liable to give rise to the
  problems referred to in this Article to an administrative procedure
  having as its purpose the rapid provision of information on the trend
  of trade flows, it shall inform the other Party.</article>

  (b) re-export to a third country of a product against which the
  exporting Party maintains quantitative export restrictions, export
  duties or measures or charges having equivalent effect, and where the
  situations referred to above give rise, or are likely to give rise to
  major difficulties for the exporting Party

  that Party may take appropriate measures under the conditions and in
  accordance with the procedures laid down in this Article.

  2. In the selection of measures, priority must be given to those which
  least disturb the functioning of the arrangements in this Agreement.
  Such measures shall not be applied in a manner which would constitute
  a means of arbitrary or unjustifiable discrimination where the same
  conditions prevail, or a disguised restriction on trade and shall be
  eliminated when the conditions no longer justify their maintenance.

  3. Before taking the measures provided for in paragraph 1 or, as soon
  as possible in cases to which paragraph 4 applies, the Community or
  Montenegro, shall supply the Interim Committee with all relevant
  information, with a view to seeking a solution acceptable to the
  Parties. The Parties within the Interim Committee may agree on any
  means needed to put an end to the difficulties. If no agreement is
  reached within 30 days of the matter being referred to the Interim
  Committee, the exporting Party may apply measures under this Article
  on the exportation of the product concerned.

  4. Where exceptional and critical circumstances requiring immediate
  action make prior information or examination, as the case may be,
  impossible, the Community or Montenegro may apply forthwith the
  precautionary measures necessary to deal with the situation and shall
  inform the other Party immediately thereof.

  5. Any measures applied pursuant to this Article shall be immediately
  notified to the Interim Committee and shall be the subject of periodic

  1. The Parties hereby agree to grant unrestricted access to Community
  transit traffic through Montenegro and to Montenegrin transit traffic
  through the Community with effect from the date of entry into force of
  this Agreement.

  2. If, as a result of the rights granted under paragraph 1, transit

  remedy the balance of payments situation. The Community or Montenegro,

  Agreement, insofar as they may affect trade between the Community and
  Montenegro:

  (i) all Agreements between undertakings, decisions by associations of
  undertakings and concerted practices between undertakings which have
  as their object or effect the prevention, restriction or distortion of
  competition;

  (ii) abuse by one or more undertakings of a dominant position in the
  territories of the Community or Montenegro as a whole or in a
  substantial part thereof;

  (iii) any State aid which distorts or threatens to distort competition
  by favouring certain undertakings or certain products.

  2. Any practices contrary to this Article shall be assessed on the
  basis of criteria arising from the application of the competition
  rules applicable in the Community, in particular from Articles 81, 82,
  86 and 87 of the Treaty establishing the European Community
  (hereinafter referred to as "EC Treaty") and interpretative
  instruments adopted by the Community institutions.

  3. The Parties shall ensure that an operationally independent
  authority is entrusted with the powers necessary for the full
  application of paragraph 1(i) and (ii) of this Article, regarding
  private and public undertakings and undertakings to which special
  rights have been granted.

  4. Montenegro shall establish an operationally independent authority
  which is entrusted with the powers necessary for the full application
  of paragraph 1(iii) within one year from the date of entry into force
  of this Agreement. This authority shall have, inter alia, the powers
  to authorise State aid schemes and individual aid grants in conformity
  with paragraph 2, as well as the powers to order the recovery of State
  aid that has been unlawfully granted.

  5. The Community on one side and Montenegro on the other side shall
  ensure transparency in the area of State aid, inter alia, by providing
  to the other Parties a regular annual report, or equivalent, following
  the methodology and the presentation of the Community survey on State
  aid. Upon request by one Party, the other Party shall provide
  information on particular individual cases of public aid.

  6. Montenegro shall establish a comprehensive inventory of aid schemes
  instituted before the establishment of the authority referred to in
  paragraph 4 and shall align such aid schemes with the criteria
  referred to in paragraph 2 within a period of no more than 4 years
  from the entry into force of this Agreement.

  7. (a) For the purposes of applying the provisions of paragraph
  1(iii), the Parties recognise that during the first five years after
  the entry into force of this Agreement, any public aid granted by
  Montenegro shall be assessed taking into account the fact that
  Montenegro shall be regarded as an area identical to those areas of
  the Community described in Article 87(3)(a) of the EC Treaty.

  (b) Within four years from the entry into force of this Agreement,
  Montenegro shall submit to the European Commission its GDP per capita
  figures harmonised at NUTS II level. The authority referred to in
  paragraph 4 and the European Commission shall then jointly evaluate
  the eligibility of the regions of Montenegro as well as the maximum
  aid intensities in relation thereto in order to draw up the regional
  aid map on the basis of the relevant Community guidelines.

  8. As appropriate, Protocol 4 establishes the rules on state aid in
  the steel industry. This protocol establishes the rules applicable in
  the event restructuring aid is granted to the steel industry. It would
  stress the exceptional character of such aid and the fact that the aid
  would be limited in time and would be linked to capacity reductions
  within the framework of feasibility programmes.

  9. With regard to products referred to in Chapter II of Title II:

  (a) paragraph 1(iii) shall not apply;

  (b) any practices contrary to paragraph 1(i) shall be assessed
  according to the criteria established by the Community on the basis of
  Articles 36 and 37 of the EC Treaty and specific Community instruments
  adopted on this basis.

  10. If one of the Parties considers that a particular practice is
  incompatible with the terms of paragraph 1, it may take appropriate
  measures after consultation within the Interim Committee or after 30
  working days following referral for such consultation.

  Nothing in this Article shall prejudice or affect in any way the
  taking, by the Community or Montenegro, of countervailing measures in
  accordance with the GATT 1994 and the WTO Agreement on Subsidies and
  Countervailing Measures and the respective related internal
  legislation.</article>
