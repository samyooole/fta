      <article number="ARTICLE 6" article_identifier="8501">The Community and Morocco shall gradually establish a free trade area
  over a transitional period lasting a maximum of 12 years starting from
  the date of the entry into force of this Agreement in accordance with
  the provisions of this Agreement and in conformity with those of the
  1994 General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade and the other multilateral
  agreements on trade in goods annexed to the Agreement establishing the
  WTO, hereinafter referred to as "GATT".</article>
    </chapter>
    <chapter number="CHAPTER I" name="Industrial Products" chapter_identifier="1013">
      <article number="ARTICLE 7" article_identifier="8502">The provisions of this chapter shall apply to products originating in
  the Community and Morocco with the exception of the products referred
  to in Annex II to the Treaty establishing the European Community.</article>
      <article number="ARTICLE 8" article_identifier="8503">No new customs duties on imports nor charges having equivalent effect
  shall be introduced in trade between the Community and Morocco.</article>
      <article number="ARTICLE 9" article_identifier="8504">Products originating in Morocco shall be imported into the Community
  free of customs duties and charges having equivalent effect.</article>
      <article number="ARTICLE 10" article_identifier="8505">1. The provisions of this chapter shall not preclude the retention by
  the Community of an agricultural component on imports of the goods
  originating in Morocco listed in Annex 1.

  The agricultural component shall reflect differences between the price
  on the Community market of the agricultural products considered as
  being used in the production of such goods and the price of imports
  from third countries where the total cost of the said basic products
  is higher in the Community. The agricultural component may take the
  form of a fixed amount or an ad valorem duty. Such differences shall
  be replaced, where appropriate, by specific duties based on
  tariffication of the agricultural component or by ad valorem duties.

  The provisions of Chapter II applicable to agricultural products shall
  apply mutatis mutandis to the agricultural component.

  2. The provisions of this chapter shall not preclude the separate
  specification by Morocco of an agricultural component in the import
  duties in force on the products listed in Annex 2 originating in the
  Community. The agricultural component may take the form of a fixed
  amount or an ad valorem duty.

  The provisions of Chapter II applicable to agricultural products shall
  apply mutatis mutandis to the agricultural component.

  3. In the case of the products shown in Annex 2, List 1, originating
  in the Community, Morocco shall apply upon the entry into force of
  this Agreement import duties and charges having equivalent effect no
  greater than those in force on 1 January 1995, within the limits of
  the tariff quotas shown in that list.

  During elimination of the industrial component of the duties pursuant
  to paragraph 4, the level of the duties to be applied in respect of
  the products for which the tariff quotas are to be abolished may not
  be higher than the level of the duties in force on 1 January 1995.

  4. In the case of the products in Annex 2, List 2, originating in the
  Community, Morocco shall eliminate the industrial component of the
  duties in accordance with the provisions laid down in Article 11(2) of
  this Agreement in respect of products in Annex 3.

  In the case of the products in Annex 2, Lists 1 and 3, originating in
  the Community, Morocco shall eliminate the industrial component of the
  duties in accordance with the provisions laid down in Article 11(3) of
  this Agreement in respect of products in Annex 4.

  5. The agricultural components applied pursuant to paragraphs 1 and 2
  may be reduced where, in trade between the Community and Morocco, the
  charge applicable to a basic agricultural product is reduced or where
  such reductions are the result of mutual concessions relating to
  processed agricultural products.

  6. The reduction referred to in paragraph 5, the list of products
  concerned and, where appropriate, the tariff quotas within which the
  reduction applies shall be established by the Association Council.</article>
      <article number="ARTICLE 11" article_identifier="8506">1. Customs duties and charges having equivalent effect applicable on
  import into Morocco of products originating in the Community other
  than those listed in Annexes 3, 4, 5 and 6 shall be abolished upon the
  entry into force of this Agreement.

  import into Morocco of the products originating in the Community
  listed in Annex 3 shall be progressively abolished in accordance with
  the following timetable:

  on the date of entry into force of this Agreement each duty and charge
  shall be reduced to 75 % of the basic duty;

  one year after the date of entry into force of this Agreement each
  duty and charge shall be reduced to 50 % of the basic duty;

  two years after the date of entry into force of this Agreement each
  duty and charge shall be reduced to 25 % of the basic duty;

  three years after the date of entry into force of this Agreement the
  remaining duties shall be abolished.

  3. Customs duties and charges having equivalent effect applicable on
  import into Morocco of the products originating in the Community
  listed in Annex 4 shall be progressively abolished in accordance with
  the following timetables:

  three years after the date of entry into force of this Agreement each
  duty and charge shall be reduced to 90 % of the basic duty;

  four years after the date of entry into force of this Agreement each
  duty and charge shall be reduced to 80 % of the basic duty;

  five years after the date of entry into force of this Agreement each
  duty and charge shall be reduced to 70 % of the basic duty;

  six years after the date of entry into force of this Agreement each
  duty and charge shall be reduced to 60 % of the basic duty;

  seven years after the date of entry into force of this Agreement each
  duty and charge shall be reduced to 50 % of the basic duty;

  10 years after the date of entry into force of this Agreement each
  duty and charge shall be reduced to 20 % of the basic duty;

  11 years after the date of entry into force of this Agreement each
  duty and charge shall be reduced to 10 % of the basic duty;

  12 years after the date of entry into force of this Agreement the
  remaining duties shall be abolished.

  4. In the event of serious difficulties for a given product, the
  timetable for the list in Annex 4 may be reviewed by the Association
  Committee by common accord on the understanding that the schedule for
  which the review has been requested may not be extended in respect of
  the product concerned beyond the maximum transitional period of 12
  years. If the Association Committee has not taken a decision within 30
  days of its application to review the timetable, Morocco may suspend
  the timetable provisionally for a period which may not exceed one
  year.

  5. For each product the basic duty to which the successive reductions
  laid down in paragraphs 2 and 3 are to be applied shall be that
  actually applied vis-à-vis the Community on 1 January 1995.

  6. If, after 1 January 1995, any tariff reduction is applied on an
  erga omnes basis, the reduced duties shall replace the basic duties
  referred to in paragraph 5 as from the date when such reductions are
  applied.

  7. Morocco shall communicate its basic duties to the Community.</article>
      <article number="ARTICLE 12" article_identifier="8507">1. Morocco hereby undertakes to eliminate the reference prices applied
  on 1 July 1995 to the products listed in Annex 5 at the latest three
  years after this Agreement enters into force.

  In cases in which such reference prices are applied to textiles and
  clothing, those prices shall be progressively eliminated over a period
  of three years dating from the entry into force of this Agreement. The
  pace at which elimination of the reference prices takes place shall
  ensure that products originating in the Community retain a margin of
  preference of at least 25 % over the reference prices which Morocco
  applies on an erga omnes basis. If that margin of preference cannot be
  maintained, Morocco shall apply a tariff reduction to products
  originating in the Community. That tariff reduction must not be lower
  than 5 % of the customs duties and charges having equivalent effect in
  force on the date on which that reduction is due to be made.

  If Morocco's commitments under the GATT provide for a shorter period
  for the elimination of import reference prices, that shorter period
  shall be applicable.

  2. The provisions of Article 11 shall not apply to the products
  appearing in Annex 6, Lists 1 and 2, without prejudice to the
  following:

  (a) in the case of the products on List 1, the provisions of Article
  19(2) shall apply only after the transitional period has elapsed.
  However, they may be made to apply sooner by a decision of the
  Association Council;

  (b) the arrangements applying to the products on Lists 1 and 2 shall
  be re-examined by the Association Council three years after this
  Agreement's entry into force.

  At the time of that re-examination, the Association Council shall
  establish a tariff-dismantling timetable for the products appearing in
  Annex 6, apart from those of subheading 630900.</article>
      <article number="ARTICLE 13" article_identifier="8508">The provisions concerning the abolition of customs duties on imports
  shall also apply to customs duties of a fiscal nature.</article>
      <article number="ARTICLE 14" article_identifier="8509">1. Exceptional measures of limited duration which derogate from the
  provisions of Article 11 may be taken by Morocco in the form of an
  increase or reintroduction of customs duties.

  These measures may only concern infant industries, or certain sectors
  undergoing restructuring or facing serious difficulties, particularly
  where these difficulties produce major social problems.

  Customs duties on imports applicable in Morocco to products
  originating in the Community introduced by these measures may not
  exceed 25 % ad valorem and shall maintain an element of preference for
  products originating in the Community. The total value of imports of
  the products which are subject to these measures may not exceed 15 %
  of total imports of industrial products from the Community during the
  last year for which statistics are available.

  These measures shall be applied for a period not exceeding five years
  unless a longer duration is authorised by the Association Committee.
  They shall cease to apply at the latest on the expiry of the maximum
  transitional period of 12 years.

  No such measures may be introduced in respect of a product if more
  than three years have elapsed since the elimination of all duties and
  quantitative restrictions or charges or measures having equivalent
  effect concerning that product.

  Morocco shall inform the Association Committee of any exceptional
  measures it intends to take and, at the request of the Community,
  consultations shall be held on such measures and the sectors to which
  they apply before they are implemented. When taking such measures
  Morocco shall provide the Committee with a timetable for the
  elimination of the customs duties introduced under this Article. This
  timetable shall provide for a phasing-out of these duties in equal
  annual instalments starting at the latest two years after their
  introduction. The Association Committee may decide on a different
  timetable.

  2. By way of derogation from the fourth subparagraph of paragraph 1,
  the Association Committee may exceptionally, in order to take account
  of the difficulties involved in setting up a new industry, authorise
  Morocco to maintain the measures already taken pursuant to paragraph 1
  for a maximum period of three years beyond the 12 year transitional
  period.</article>

  2. Without prejudice to the provisions of paragraph 1 and taking
  account of the patterns of trade in agricultural products between the
  Parties and the particular sensitivity of such products, the Community
  and Morocco will examine on a regular basis in the Association
  Council, product by product and on a reciprocal basis, the

  Committee shall meet to take appropriate account of that Party's

  Association Committee concerning agreements establishing customs
  unions or free trade areas and, where appropriate, on other major
  issues related to their respective trade policies with third

  and where the situations referred to above give rise, or are likely to
  give rise, to major difficulties for the exporting Party, that Party

  2. In the cases specified in Articles 24, 25 and 26, before taking the
  measures provided for therein or, in cases to which paragraph 3(d) of

  3. For the implementation of paragraph 2, the following provisions
  shall apply:

  (a) as regards Article 24, the exporting Party shall be informed of
  the dumping case as soon as the authorities of the importing Party
  have initiated an investigation. When no end has been put to the
  dumping within the meaning of Article VI of the General Agreement on
  Tariffs and Trade or no other satisfactory solution has been reached

  adopt the appropriate measures;

  (b) as regards Article 25, the difficulties arising from the situation
  referred to in that Article shall be referred for examination to the
  Association Committee, which may take any decision needed to put an
  end to such difficulties.

  If the Association Committee or the exporting Party has not taken a
  decision putting an end to the difficulties or no other satisfactory
  solution has been reached within 30 days of the matter being referred,
  the importing Party may adopt the appropriate measures to remedy the
  problem. These measures shall not exceed the scope of what is

  Agreement, in so far as they may affect trade between the Community
  and Morocco:

  (a) all agreements between undertakings, decisions by associations of
  undertakings and concerted practices between undertakings which have
  as their object or effect the prevention, restriction or distortion of
  competition;

  (b) abuse by one or more undertakings of a dominant position in the
  territories of the Community or of Morocco as a whole or in a

  (c) any official aid which distorts or threatens to distort
  competition by favouring certain undertakings or the production of
  certain goods, with the exception of cases in which a derogation is
  allowed under the Treaty establishing the European Coal and Steel
  Community.

  2. Any practices contrary to this Article shall be assessed on the
  basis of criteria arising from the application of the rules of
  Articles 85, 86 and 92 of the Treaty establishing the European
  Community(1) and, in the case of products falling within the scope of
  the European Coal and Steel Community, the rules of Articles 65 and 66
  of the Treaty establishing that Community, and the rules relating to
  State aid, including secondary legislation.

  3. The Association Council shall, within five years of the entry into
  force of this Agreement, adopt the necessary rules for the
  implementation of paragraphs 1 and 2.

  Until these rules are adopted, the provisions of the Agreement on
  interpretation and application of Articles VI, XVI and XXIII of the
  General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade shall be applied as the rules
  for the implementation of paragraph 1(c) and related parts of
  paragraph 2.

  4. (a) For the purposes of applying the provisions of paragraph 1(c),
  the Parties recognise that during the first five years after the entry
  into force of this Agreement, any State aid granted by Morocco shall
  be assessed taking into account the fact that Morocco shall be
  regarded as an area identical to those areas of the Community
  described in Article 92(3)(a) of the Treaty establishing the European
  Community.

  During the same period of time, Morocco may exceptionally, as regards
  ECSC steel products, grant State aid for restructuring purposes
  provided that:

  - it leads to the viability of the recipient firms under normal market
  conditions at the end of the restructuring period,

  - the amount and intensity of such aid are strictly limited to what is
  absolutely necessary in order to restore such viability and are
  progressively reduced,

  - the restructuring programme is linked to a comprehensive plan for
  rationalising capacity in Morocco.

  The Association Council shall, taking into account the economic
  situation of Morocco, decide whether the period should be extended
  every five years.

  b) Each Party shall ensure transparency in the area of official aid,
  inter alia, by reporting annually to the other Party on the total
  amount and the distribution of the aid given and by providing, upon
  request, information on aid schemes. Upon request by one Party, the
  other Party shall provide information on particular individual cases
  of official aid.

  5. With regard to products referred to in Chapter II of Title II:

  - the provisions of paragraph 1(c) do not apply,

  - any practices contrary to paragraph 1(a) shall be assessed according
  to the criteria established by the Community on the basis of Articles
  42 and 43 of the Treaty establishing the European Community, and in
  particular those established in Council Regulation (EEC) No 26/62.

  6. If the Community or Morocco considers that a particular practice is
  incompatible with the terms of paragraph 1, and:

  - is not adequately dealt with under the implementing rules referred
  to in paragraph 3, or

  - in the absence of such rules, and if such practice causes or
  threatens to cause serious prejudice to the interest of the other
  Party or material injury to its domestic industry, including its
  services industry,

  it may take appropriate measures after consultation within the
  Association Committee or after 30 working days following referral to
  that Committee.

  In the case of practices incompatible with paragraph 1(c) of this
  Article, such appropriate measures may, where the GATT applies
  thereto, only be adopted in accordance with the procedures and under
  the conditions laid down by the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade
  and any other relevant instrument negotiated under its auspices which
  is applicable between the Parties.

  professional and business secrecy.</article>
