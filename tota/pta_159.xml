maintaining measures, including environmental measures: 




(i) necessary to secure compliance with laws and regulations that are 




not inconsistent with this Agreement;

At the request of a disputing party, and unless the disputing parties otherwise agree, the tribunal may determine the place of meetings, including consultations and hearings, taking into consideration appropriate factors, including the convenience of the parties and the arbitrators, the location of the subject matter, and the proximity of evidence.

5. After consulting the disputing parties, the tribunal may allow a party or entity that is not a disputing party to file a written amicus curiae submission with the tribunal regarding a matter within the scope of the dispute.  In determining whether to allow such a filing, the tribunal shall consider, among other things, the extent to which: 


(a) 	the amicus curiae submission would assist the tribunal in the determination of a factual or legal issue related to the proceeding by bringing a perspective, particular knowledge, or insight that is different from that of the disputing parties; 


(b) 	the amicus curiae submission would address a matter within the scope of the dispute; and 


(c) 	the amicus curiae has a significant interest in the proceeding.

(a) 	Such objection shall be submitted to the tribunal as soon as possible after the tribunal is constituted, and in no event later than the date the tribunal fixes for the respondent to submit its counter-memorial or, in the case of an amendment to the notice of arbitration, the date the tribunal fixes for the respondent to submit its response to the amendment. 


(b) 	On receipt of an objection under this paragraph, the tribunal shall suspend any proceedings on the merits, establish a schedule for considering the objection consistent with any schedule it has established for considering any other preliminary question, and issue a decision or award on the objection, stating the grounds therefor. 


(c) 	In deciding an objection under this paragraph, the tribunal shall assume to be true claimant’s factual allegations in support of any claim in the notice of arbitration (or any amendment thereof) and, in disputes brought under the UNCITRAL Arbitration Rules, the statement of claim referred to in Article 18 of the UNCITRAL Arbitration Rules. The tribunal may also consider any relevant facts not in dispute. 


(d) 	The respondent does not waive any objection as to competence or any argument on the merits merely because the respondent did or did not raise 
an objection under this paragraph or make use of the expedited procedure set out in paragraph 7. 


7. In the event that the respondent so requests within 45 days of the date the tribunal is constituted, the tribunal shall decide on an expedited basis an objection under paragraph 6 and any objection that the dispute is not within the tribunal’s competence.  The tribunal shall suspend any proceedings on the merits and issue a decision or award on the objection(s), stating the grounds therefor, no later than 150 days after the date of the request. However, if a disputing party requests a hearing, the tribunal may take an additional 30 days to issue the decision or award. Regardless of whether a hearing is requested, a tribunal may, on a showing of extraordinary cause, delay issuing its decision or award by an additional brief period, which may not exceed 30 days. 


8. When it decides a respondent’s objection under paragraph 6 or 7, the tribunal may, if warranted, award to the prevailing disputing party reasonable costs and attorney’s fees incurred in submitting or opposing the objection.  In determining whether such an award is warranted, the tribunal shall consider whether either the claimant’s claim or the respondent’s objection was frivolous, and shall provide the disputing parties a reasonable opportunity to comment. 


9. A respondent may not assert as a defense, counterclaim, or right of set-off, or for any other reason, that the claimant has received or will receive indemnification or other compensation for all or part of the alleged damages pursuant to an insurance or guarantee contract, except with respect to any subrogation as provided for in Article 11.14. 


10. A tribunal may order an interim measure of protection to preserve the rights of a disputing party, or to ensure that the tribunal’s jurisdiction is made fully effective, including an order to preserve evidence in the possession or control of a disputing party or to protect the tribunal’s jurisdiction. A tribunal may not order attachment or enjoin the application of a measure alleged to constitute a breach referred to in Article 11.16.  For purposes of this paragraph, an order includes a recommendation. 


11. 	(a) In any arbitration conducted under this Section, at the request of a disputing party, a tribunal shall, before issuing a decision or award on liability, transmit its proposed decision or award to the disputing parties and to the non-disputing Party. Within 60 days after the date the tribunal transmits its proposed decision or award, the disputing parties may submit written comments to the tribunal concerning any aspect of its proposed decision or award. The tribunal shall consider any such comments and issue its decision or award not later than 45 days after the date the 60-day comment period expires. 

(b) 	Subparagraph (a) shall not apply in any arbitration conducted pursuant to this Section for which an appeal has been made available pursuant to paragraph 12 or Annex 11-D. 

12. If a separate, multilateral agreement enters into force between the Parties that establishes an appellate body for purposes of reviewing awards rendered by tribunals constituted pursuant to international trade or investment arrangements to hear investment disputes, the Parties shall strive to reach an agreement that would have such appellate body 
review awards rendered under Article 11.26 in arbitrations commenced after the multilateral agreement enters into force between the Parties.</article>

More Extensive Protection and Enforcement 

5. A Party may provide more extensive protection for, and enforcement of, intellectual property rights under its law than this Chapter requires, provided that the more extensive protection does not contravene this Chapter. 

National Treatment 


6. In respect of all categories of intellectual property covered in this Chapter, each Party shall accord to nationals2 of the other Party treatment no less favorable than it accords to its own nationals with regard to the protection3 and enjoyment of such intellectual property rights and any benefits derived from such rights.  With respect to secondary uses of phonograms by means of analog communications, analog free over-theair radio broadcasting, and analog free over-the-air television broadcasting, however, a Party may limit the rights of performers and producers of phonograms of the other Party to the rights its persons are accorded in the territory of the other Party. 


7. A Party may derogate from paragraph 6 in relation to its judicial and administrative procedures, including requiring a national of the other Party to designate an address for service of process in its territory, or to appoint an agent in its territory, provided that such derogation is: 


(a) 	necessary to secure compliance with laws and regulations that are not inconsistent with this Chapter; and 


(b) 	not applied in a manner that would constitute a disguised restriction on trade. 

8. Paragraph 6 does not apply to procedures provided in multilateral agreements to which either Party is a party concluded under the auspices of the WIPO in relation to the acquisition or maintenance of intellectual property rights. 
2  For purposes of paragraphs 6 and 7 and Articles 18.2.14(a), and 18.6.1, a “national” of a Party shall include, in respect of the relevant right, any person (as defined in Article 1.4 (Definitions)), of that Party that would meet the criteria for eligibility for protection of that right provided for in the agreements listed in paragraph 3 and the TRIPS Agreement. 

3  For purposes of paragraph 6, “protection” includes: (1) matters affecting the availability, acquisition, scope, maintenance, and enforcement of intellectual property rights as well as matters affecting the use of intellectual property rights specifically covered by this Chapter; and (2) the prohibition on circumvention of effective technological measures set out in Article 18.4.7 and the rights and obligations concerning rights management information set out in Article 18.4.8. 

Application of Agreement to Existing Subject Matter and Prior Acts 



9. Except as it provides otherwise, including in Article 18.4.5, this Chapter gives rise to obligations in respect of all subject matter existing at the date this Agreement enters into force that is protected on that date in the territory of the Party where protection is claimed, or that meets or comes subsequently to meet the criteria for protection under this Chapter. 


10. Except as otherwise provided in this Chapter, including in Article 18.4.5, a Party shall not be required to restore protection to subject matter that on the date this Agreement enters into force has fallen into the public domain in the territory of the Party where the protection is claimed.  


11. This Chapter does not give rise to obligations in respect of acts that occurred before the date this Agreement enters into force.  
Transparency 

12. Further to Article 21.1 (Publication), and with the object of making the protection and enforcement of intellectual property rights transparent, each Party shall ensure that all laws, regulations, and procedures concerning the protection or enforcement of intellectual property rights are in writing and are published,4 or where publication is not practicable made publicly available, in its national language in such a manner as to enable governments and right holders to become acquainted with them.</article>
      <article number="ARTICLE 18.2" name="Trademarks Including Geographical Indications" article_identifier="15432">1. Neither Party may require, as a condition of registration, that signs be visually perceptible, nor may either Party deny registration of a trademark solely on the grounds that the sign of which it is composed is a sound or scent. 


2. Each Party shall provide that trademarks shall include certification marks.  Each Party shall also provide that geographical indications are eligible for protection as trademarks.5 


3. Each Party shall ensure that its measures mandating the use of the term customary in common language as the common name for a good or service (common name), including, inter alia, requirements concerning the relative size, placement or style of use

5  For purposes of this Chapter, geographical indications means indications that identify a good as originating in the territory of a Party, or a region or locality in that territory, where a given quality, reputation, or other characteristic of the good is essentially attributable to its geographical origin.  Any sign (such as words, including geographical and personal names, as well as letters, numerals, figurative elements, and colors, including single colors) or combination of signs, in any form whatsoever, shall be eligible to be a geographical indication.  “Originating” in this Chapter does not have the meaning ascribed to that term in Article 1.4 (Definitions).

4. Each Party shall provide that the owner of a registered trademark shall have the exclusive right to prevent all third parties not having the owner’s consent from using in the course of trade identical or similar signs, including geographical indications, at least for goods or services that are identical or similar to those goods or services in respect of which the owner’s trademark is registered, where such use would result in a likelihood of confusion. In the case of the use of an identical sign, including a geographical indication, for identical goods or services, a likelihood of confusion shall be presumed. 


5. Each Party may provide limited exceptions to the rights conferred by a trademark, such as fair use of descriptive terms, provided that such exceptions take account of the legitimate interests of the owner of the trademark and of third parties.  


6. Neither Party may require, as a condition for determining that a mark is a well-known mark, that the mark has been registered in the territory of that Party or in another jurisdiction.  Additionally, neither Party may deny remedies or relief with respect to well-known marks solely because of the lack of: 


(a) a registration; 


(b) inclusion on a list of well-known marks; or 


(c) prior recognition of the mark as well-known. 

7. Article 6bis of the Paris Convention shall apply, mutatis mutandis, to goods or services that are not identical or similar to those identified by a well-known trademark,6 whether registered or not, provided that use of that trademark in relation to those goods or services would indicate a connection between those goods or services and the owner of the trademark, and provided that the interests of the owner of the trademark are likely to be damaged by such use. 


8. Each Party shall provide for appropriate measures to refuse or cancel the registration and prohibit the use of a trademark or geographical indication that is identical or similar to a well-known trademark, for related goods or services, if the use of that trademark or geographical indication is likely to cause confusion, or to cause mistake, or to deceive or risk associating the trademark or geographical indication with the owner of the well-known trademark, or constitutes unfair exploitation of the reputation of the well-known trademark. 


9. Each Party shall provide a system for the registration of trademarks, which shall include: 
6  For purposes of determining whether a mark is well-known, neither Party may require that the reputation of the trademark extend beyond the sector of the public that normally deals with the relevant goods or services.

(b) 	an opportunity for the applicant to respond to communications from the trademark authorities, to contest an initial refusal, and to appeal judicially a final refusal to register; 


(c) 	an opportunity for interested parties to oppose a trademark application and to seek cancellation of a trademark after it has been registered; and 


(d) 	a requirement that decisions in opposition and cancellation proceedings be reasoned and in writing.  Written decisions may be provided electronically. 
10. 	Each Party shall provide a: 


(a) 	system for the electronic application for, and electronic processing, registering, and maintenance of, trademarks; and 


(b) 	publicly available electronic database, including an online database, of trademark applications and registrations. 
11. 	Each Party shall provide that: 


(a) 	each registration and publication that concerns a trademark application or registration and that indicates goods or services shall indicate the goods or services by their names, grouped according to the classes of the classification established by the Nice Agreement Concerning the International Classification of Goods and Services for the Purposes of the Registration of Marks (1979), as revised and amended (Nice Classification); and 


(b) 	goods or services may not be considered as being similar to each other solely on the ground that, in any registration or publication, they appear in the same class of the Nice Classification.  Conversely, each Party shall provide that goods or services may not be considered as being dissimilar from each other solely on the ground that, in any registration or publication, they appear in different classes of the Nice Classification. 

12. Each Party shall provide that initial registration and each renewal of registration of a trademark shall be for a term of no less than ten years. 


13. Neither Party may require recordation of trademark licenses to establish the validity of the license, to assert any rights in a trademark, or for other purposes. 


14. If a Party provides the means to apply for protection or petition for recognition of geographical indications, through a system of protection of trademarks or otherwise, it shall, with respect to such applications and petitions (as relevant to the means chosen by the Party): 
(a) 

accept those applications and petitions without requiring intercession by a 


Party on behalf of its nationals; 
(b) 

process those applications and petitions with a minimum of formalities; 
(c) 

ensure that its regulations governing filing of those applications and 


petitions are readily available to the public and set out clearly the 


procedures for these actions; 
(d) 

make available contact information sufficient to allow the general public to 


obtain guidance concerning the procedures for filing applications and 


petitions and the processing of those applications and petitions in general; 


and to allow applicants, petitioners, or their representatives to ascertain the 


status of, and to obtain procedural guidance concerning, specific 


applications and petitions; and 
(e) 

ensure that applications and petitions for geographical indications are 


published for opposition, and provide procedures for opposing 


geographical indications that are the subject of applications or petitions. 


Each Party shall also provide procedures to cancel a registration resulting 


from an application or a petition. 
15. 

(a) 

Each Party shall provide that each of the following shall be grounds for 




refusing protection or recognition of, and for opposition and cancellation 




of, a geographical indication: 




(i) the geographical indication is likely to cause confusion with a 




trademark that is the subject of a good faith pending application or 




registration in the Party’s territory and that has a priority date that 




predates the protection or recognition of the geographical 




indication in that territory;  




(ii) the geographical indication is likely to cause confusion with a 




trademark, the rights to which have been acquired in the Party’s 




territory through use in good faith, that has a priority date that 




predates the protection or recognition of the geographical 




indication in that territory; and  




(iii) the geographical indication is likely to cause confusion with a 




trademark that has become well known in the Party’s territory and 




that has a priority date that predates the protection or recognition of 




the geographical indication in that territory. 


(b) 

For purposes of subparagraph (a), the date of protection of the 




geographical indication in a Party’s territory shall be: 




(i) in the case of protection or recognition provided as a result of an 




application or petition, the date of the application or petition; and 
(ii) 	in the case of protection or recognition provided through other means, the date of protection or recognition under the Party’s laws.</article>

2. Each Party shall require that the management of its ccTLD provide online public access to a reliable and accurate database of contact information concerning domain-name registrants.</article>
      <article number="ARTICLE 18.4" name="Copyright And Related Rights" article_identifier="15434">1.

11  Each Party shall confine limitations or exceptions to the rights described in paragraph 1 to certain special cases that do not conflict with a normal exploitation of the work, performance, or phonogram, and do not unreasonably prejudice the legitimate interests of the right holder.  For greater certainty, each Party may adopt or maintain limitations or exceptions to the rights described in paragraph 1 for fair use, as long as any such limitation or exception is confined as stated in the previous sentence.

Likewise, each Party shall provide that in cases where authorization is needed from both the author of a work embodied in a phonogram and a performer or producer owning rights in the phonogram, the need for the authorization of the performer or producer does not cease to exist because the authorization of the author is also required. 

4. Each Party shall provide that, where the term of protection of a work (including a photographic work), performance, or phonogram is to be calculated: 


(a) 	on the basis of the life of a natural person, the term shall be not less than the life of the author and 70 years after the author’s death; and 


(b) 	on a basis other than the life of a natural person, the term shall be:

7. 	(a) In order to provide adequate legal protection and effective legal remedies against the circumvention of effective technological measures that authors, performers, and producers of phonograms use in connection with the exercise of their rights and that restrict unauthorized acts in respect of their works, performances, and phonograms, each Party shall provide that any person who: 


(i) 	knowingly, or having reasonable grounds to know, circumvents without authority any effective technological measure that controls access to a protected work, performance, phonogram, or other subject matter; or

(ii) 	Measures implementing subparagraph (a)(ii), as they apply to effective technological measures that control access to a work, performance, or phonogram, may be subject to exceptions and limitations with respect to activities set forth in subparagraph (d)(i), (ii), (iii), (iv), and (vi). 
(iii) 	Measures implementing subparagraph (a)(ii), as they apply to effective technological measures that protect any copyright or any rights related to copyright, may be subject to exceptions and limitations with respect to activities set forth in subparagraph (d)(i) and (vi). 

(f) 	Effective technological measure means any technology, device, or component that, in the normal course of its operation, controls access to a protected work, performance, phonogram, or other protected subject matter, or protects any copyright or any rights related to copyright. 
8. In order to provide adequate and effective legal remedies to protect rights management information: 

(a) 	Each Party shall provide that any person who without authority, and knowing, or, with respect to civil remedies, having reasonable grounds to know, that it would induce, enable, facilitate, or conceal an infringement of any copyright or related right,

when any of these items is attached to a copy of the work, performance, or phonogram or appears in connection with the communication or making available of a work, performance, or phonogram to the public. 

(d) 	For greater certainty, nothing in this paragraph shall be construed to obligate a Party to require the owner of any right in the work, performance, or phonogram to attach rights management information to copies of the work, performance, or phonogram, or to cause rights management information to appear in connection with a communication of the work, performance, or phonogram to the public. 

9. Each Party shall provide appropriate laws, orders, regulations, government-issued guidelines, or administrative or executive decrees providing that its central government agencies not use infringing computer software and other materials protected by copyright or related rights and only use computer software and other materials protected by copyright or related rights as authorized by the relevant license. These measures shall provide for the regulation of the acquisition and management of software and other materials for government use that are protected by copyright or related rights.

2. 	Each Party may only exclude from patentability: 
18  For greater certainty, “make use of” includes viewing of the signal, whether private or commercial. 

19  For purposes of Article 18.8, a Party may treat the terms “inventive step” and “capable of industrial application” as synonymous with the terms “non-obvious” and “useful” respectively. 


(a) 	inventions, the prevention within its territory of the commercial exploitation of which is necessary to protect ordre public or morality, including to protect human, animal, or plant life or health or to avoid serious prejudice to the environment, provided that such exclusion is not made merely because the exploitation is prohibited by its law; and  


(b) 	diagnostic, therapeutic, and surgical procedures for the treatment of humans or animals.  

3. Each Party may provide limited exceptions to the exclusive rights conferred by a patent, provided that such exceptions do not unreasonably conflict with a normal exploitation of the patent and do not unreasonably prejudice the legitimate interests of the patent owner, taking account of the legitimate interests of third parties. 


4. Each Party shall provide that a patent may be revoked only on grounds that would have justified a refusal to grant the patent. A Party may also provide that fraud, misrepresentation, or inequitable conduct may be the basis for revoking a patent or holding a patent unenforceable. Where a Party provides proceedings that permit a third party to oppose the grant of a patent, the Party shall not make such proceedings available before the grant of the patent. 


5. Consistent with paragraph 3, if a Party permits a third person to use the subject matter of a subsisting patent to generate information necessary to support an application for marketing approval of a pharmaceutical product, that Party shall provide that any product produced under such authority shall not be made, used, or sold in its territory other than for purposes related to generating such information to support an application for meeting marketing approval requirements of that Party, and if the Party permits exportation of such product, the Party shall provide that the product shall only be exported outside its territory for purposes of generating information to support an application for meeting marketing approval requirements of that Party. 


6. 	(a) Each Party, at the request of the patent owner, shall adjust the term of a patent to compensate for unreasonable delays that occur in granting the patent. For purposes of this subparagraph, an unreasonable delay shall at least include a delay in the issuance of the patent of more than four years from the date of filing of the application in the territory of the Party, or three years after a request for examination of the application, whichever is later. Periods attributable to actions of the patent applicant need not be included in the determination of such delays.20 

(b) 	With respect to patents covering a new pharmaceutical product21 that is approved for marketing in the territory of the Party and methods of making or using a new pharmaceutical product that is approved for marketing in the territory of the Party, each Party, at the request of the patent owner, shall make available an adjustment of the patent term or the term of the patent rights of a patent covering a new pharmaceutical product, its approved method of use, or a method of making the product to compensate the patent owner for unreasonable curtailment of the effective patent term as a result of the marketing approval process related to the first commercial use of that pharmaceutical product in the territory of that Party. Any adjustment under this subparagraph shall confer all of the exclusive rights, subject to the same limitations and exceptions, of the patent claims of the product, its method of use, or its method of manufacture in the originally issued patent as applicable to the product and the approved method of use of the product.22 

7. Each Party shall disregard information contained in public disclosures used to determine if an invention is novel or has an inventive step if the public disclosure: 


(a) 	was made or authorized by, or derived from, the patent applicant, and 


(b) 	occurred within 12 months prior to the date of filing of the application in the territory of the Party.23 

8. Each Party shall provide patent applicants with at least one opportunity to make amendments, corrections, and observations in connection with their applications. 


9. Each Party shall provide that a disclosure of a claimed invention shall be considered to be sufficiently clear and complete if it provides information that allows the invention to be made and used by a person skilled in the art, without undue experimentation, as of the filing date. 


10. 	Each Party shall provide that a claimed invention: 
20  Notwithstanding Article 18.1.9, subparagraph (a) shall apply to all patent applications filed on or after January 1, 2008. 

(a) 	is sufficiently supported by its disclosure if the disclosure allows a person skilled in the art to extend the teaching therein to the entire scope of the claim, thereby showing that the applicant does not claim subject matter which the applicant had not recognized and described or possessed on the filing date; and 

21  For greater certainty, new pharmaceutical product in subparagraph (b) means a product that at least contains a new chemical entity that has not been previously approved as a pharmaceutical product in the territory of the Party. 

22  For purposes of subparagraph (b), effective patent term means the period from the date of approval of the product until the original expiration date of the patent. 

23  Notwithstanding Article 18.1.9, paragraph 7 shall apply to all patent applications filed on or after January 1, 2008. 

(b) 	is industrially applicable if it has a specific, substantial, and credible utility. 

11. The Parties shall endeavor to establish a framework for cooperation between their respective patent offices as a basis for progress towards the mutual exploitation of search and examination work.

      <article number="ARTICLE 18.10" name="Enforcement Of Intellectual Property Rights" article_identifier="15440">General Obligations 


1. Each Party shall provide that final judicial decisions and administrative rulings of general application pertaining to the enforcement of intellectual property rights be in writing and state any relevant findings of fact and the reasoning or the legal basis on which the decisions and rulings are based. Each Party shall also provide that those decisions and rulings be published25 or, where publication is not practicable, otherwise made available to the public, in its national language in such a manner as to enable governments and right holders to become acquainted with them. 


2. Each Party shall publicize information on its efforts to provide effective enforcement of intellectual property rights in its civil, administrative, and criminal systems, including any statistical information that the Party may collect for such 
26

purposes.

3. In civil, administrative, and criminal proceedings involving copyright or related rights, each Party shall provide for a presumption that, in the absence of proof to the contrary, the person whose name is indicated as the author, producer, performer, or 

25  A Party may satisfy the publication requirement in paragraph 1 by making the decision or ruling available to the public on the Internet. 

26  For greater certainty, nothing in paragraph 2 is intended to prescribe the type, format, and method of publication of the information a Party must publicize. 

publisher of the work, performance, or phonogram in the usual manner is the designated right holder in such work, performance, or phonogram.  Each Party shall also provide for a presumption that, in the absence of proof to the contrary, the copyright or related right subsists in such subject matter.  In civil, administrative, and criminal proceedings involving trademarks, each Party shall provide for a rebuttable presumption that a registered trademark is valid.  In civil and administrative proceedings involving patents, each Party shall provide for a rebuttable presumption that a patent is valid, and shall provide that each claim of a patent is presumed valid independently of the validity of the other claims. 

Civil and Administrative Procedures and Remedies 


4. Each Party shall make available to right holders27 civil judicial procedures concerning the enforcement of any intellectual property right. 


5. 	Each Party shall provide that: 


(a) 	in civil judicial proceedings, its judicial authorities shall have the authority to order the infringer to pay the right holder: 


(i) 	damages adequate to compensate for the injury the right holder has suffered as a result of the infringement;28 or 


(ii) 	at least in the case of copyright or related rights infringement and trademark counterfeiting, the profits of the infringer that are attributable to the infringement, which may be presumed to be the amount of damages referred to in clause (i); and 

(b) 	in determining damages for infringement of intellectual property rights, its judicial authorities shall consider, inter alia, the value of the infringed good or service, measured by the market price, the suggested retail price, or other legitimate measure of value submitted by the right holder.  

6. In civil judicial proceedings, each Party shall, at least with respect to works, phonograms, and performances protected by copyright or related rights, and in cases of trademark counterfeiting, establish or maintain pre-established damages, which shall be available on the election of the right holder. Pre-established damages shall be in an amount sufficient to constitute a deterrent to future infringements and to compensate fully the right holder for the harm caused by the infringement.29 
27  For purposes of Article 18.10, “right holder” includes a federation or an association having the legal standing and authority to assert such rights, and also includes a person that exclusively has any one or more of the intellectual property rights encompassed in a given intellectual property. 

28  In the case of patent infringement, damages adequate to compensate for the infringement shall not be less than a reasonable royalty.  

29  Neither Party is required to apply paragraph 6 to actions for infringement against a Party or a third party acting with the authorization or consent of a Party. 


7. Each Party shall provide that its judicial authorities, except in exceptional circumstances, shall have the authority to order, at the conclusion of civil judicial proceedings concerning copyright or related rights infringement, patent infringement, or trademark infringement, that the prevailing party shall be awarded payment by the losing party of court costs or fees and, at least in proceedings concerning copyright or related rights infringement or willful trademark counterfeiting, reasonable attorney’s fees.  Further, each Party shall provide that its judicial authorities, at least in exceptional circumstances, shall have the authority to order, at the conclusion of civil judicial proceedings concerning patent infringement, that the prevailing party shall be awarded payment by the losing party of reasonable attorneys’ fees. 


8. In civil judicial proceedings concerning copyright or related rights infringement and trademark counterfeiting, each Party shall provide that its judicial authorities shall have the authority to order the seizure of allegedly infringing goods, materials, and implements relevant to the act of infringement, and, at least for trademark counterfeiting, documentary evidence relevant to the infringement. 


9. 	Each Party shall provide that: 


(a) 	in civil judicial proceedings, at the right holder’s request, goods that have been found to be pirated or counterfeit shall be destroyed, except in exceptional circumstances; 


(b) 	its judicial authorities shall have the authority to order that materials and implements that have been used in the manufacture or creation of such pirated or counterfeit goods be, without compensation of any sort, promptly destroyed or, in exceptional circumstances, without compensation of any sort, disposed of outside the channels of commerce in such a manner as to minimize the risks of further infringements; and 


(c) 	in regard to counterfeit trademarked goods, the simple removal of the trademark unlawfully affixed shall not be sufficient to permit the release of goods into the channels of commerce.  

10. Each Party shall provide that in civil judicial proceedings concerning the enforcement of intellectual property rights, its judicial authorities shall have the authority to order the infringer to provide, for the purpose of collecting evidence, any information that the infringer possesses or controls regarding any person or persons involved in any aspect of the infringement and regarding the means of production or distribution channel of such goods or services, including the identification of third persons involved in the production and distribution of the infringing goods or services or in their channels of distribution, and to provide this information to the right holder or the judicial authorities. 


11. 	Each Party shall provide that its judicial authorities have the authority to: 


(a) 	fine, detain, or imprison, in appropriate cases, a party to a civil judicial proceeding who fails to abide by valid orders issued by such authorities; and 


(b) 	impose sanctions on parties to a civil judicial proceeding, their counsel, experts, or other persons subject to the court’s jurisdiction, for violation of judicial orders regarding the protection of confidential information produced or exchanged in a proceeding. 

12. To the extent that any civil remedy can be ordered as a result of administrative procedures on the merits of a case, each Party shall provide that such procedures conform to principles equivalent in substance to those set out in this Chapter. 


13. In civil judicial proceedings concerning the acts described in paragraphs 7 and 8 of Article 18.4, each Party shall provide that its judicial authorities shall, at the least, have the authority to:  


(a) 	impose provisional measures, including seizure of devices and products suspected of being involved in the prohibited activity; 


(b) 	provide an opportunity for the right holder to elect award of either actual damages it suffered or pre-established damages; 


(c) 	order payment to the prevailing right holder at the conclusion of civil judicial proceedings of court costs and fees, and reasonable attorney’s fees, by the party engaged in the prohibited conduct; and 


(d) 	order the destruction of devices and products found to be involved in the prohibited activity. 
Neither Party may make damages available under this paragraph against a nonprofit library, archives, educational institution, or public noncommercial broadcasting entity that sustains the burden of proving that it was not aware and had no reason to believe that its acts constituted a prohibited activity. 


14. In civil judicial proceedings concerning the enforcement of intellectual property rights, each Party shall provide that its judicial authorities shall have the authority to order a party to desist from an infringement, in order, inter alia, to prevent infringing imports from entering the channels of commerce and to prevent their exportation. 


15. In the event that a Party’s judicial or other competent authorities appoint technical or other experts in civil proceedings concerning the enforcement of intellectual property rights and require that the parties to the litigation bear the costs of such experts, the Party should seek to ensure that such costs are closely related, inter alia, to the quantity and nature of work to be performed and do not unreasonably deter recourse to such proceedings. 
Alternative Dispute Resolution 

16. Each Party may permit use of alternative dispute resolution procedures to resolve civil disputes concerning intellectual property rights. 

Provisional Measures 



17. Each Party shall act on requests for provisional measures inaudita altera parte expeditiously. 


18. Each Party shall provide that its judicial authorities have the authority to require the plaintiff, with respect to provisional measures, to provide any reasonably available evidence in order to satisfy themselves with a sufficient degree of certainty that the plaintiff’s right is being infringed or that such infringement is imminent, and to order the plaintiff to provide a reasonable security or equivalent assurance set at a level sufficient to protect the defendant and to prevent abuse, and so as not to unreasonably deter recourse to such procedures. 
Special Requirements Related to Border Measures 


19. Each Party shall provide that any right holder initiating procedures for its competent authorities to suspend release of suspected counterfeit or confusingly similar trademark goods, or pirated copyright goods30 into free circulation is required to provide adequate evidence to satisfy the competent authorities that, under the laws of the country of importation, there is prima facie an infringement of the right holder's intellectual property right and to supply sufficient information that may reasonably be expected to be within the right holder’s knowledge to make the suspected goods reasonably recognizable by its competent authorities.  The requirement to provide sufficient information shall not unreasonably deter recourse to these procedures.  Each Party shall provide that the application to suspend the release of goods shall apply to all points of entry to its territory and remain applicable for a period of not less than one year from the date of application, or the period that the good is protected by copyright or that the relevant trademark registration is valid, whichever is shorter. 


20. Each Party shall provide that its competent authorities shall have the authority to require a right holder initiating procedures to suspend the release of suspected counterfeit or confusingly similar trademark goods, or pirated copyright goods, to provide a reasonable security or equivalent assurance sufficient to protect the defendant and the competent authorities and to prevent abuse.  Each Party shall provide that the security or equivalent assurance shall not unreasonably deter recourse to these procedures.  Each Party may provide that the security may be in the form of a bond conditioned to hold the importer or owner of the imported merchandise harmless from any loss or damage resulting from any suspension of the release of goods in the event the competent 
30  For purposes of paragraphs 19 through 25: 


(a) counterfeit trademark goods means any goods, including packaging, bearing without authorization a trademark that is identical to the trademark validly registered in respect of such goods, or that cannot be distinguished in its essential aspects from such a trademark, and that thereby infringes the rights of the owner of the trademark in question under the law of the country of importation; and 


(b) pirated copyright goods means any goods that are copies made without the consent of the right holder or person duly authorized by the right holder in the country of production and that are made directly or indirectly from an article where the making of that copy would have constituted an infringement of a copyright or a related right under the law of the country of importation.  
authorities determine that the article is not an infringing good. In no case shall an importer be permitted to post a bond or other security to obtain possession of suspected counterfeit or confusingly similar trademark goods, or of pirated copyright goods. 


21. Where its competent authorities have seized goods that are counterfeit or pirated, a Party shall inform the right holder within 30 days of the seizure of the names and addresses of the consignor, importer, exporter, or consignee, and provide to the right holder a description of the merchandise, the quantity of the merchandise, and, if known, the country of origin of the merchandise. 


22. Each Party shall provide that its competent authorities may initiate border measures ex officio31 with respect to imported, exported, or in-transit merchandise,32 or merchandise in free trade zones, that is suspected of being counterfeit or confusingly similar trademark goods, or pirated copyright goods. 


23. Each Party shall provide that goods that have been suspended from release by its customs authorities, and that have been forfeited as pirated or counterfeit, shall be destroyed, except in exceptional circumstances.  In regard to counterfeit trademark goods, the simple removal of the trademark unlawfully affixed shall not be sufficient to permit the release of the goods into the channels of commerce.  In no event shall the competent authorities be authorized, except in exceptional circumstances, to permit the exportation of counterfeit or pirated goods or to permit such goods to be subject to other customs procedures. 


24. Where an application fee or merchandise storage fee is assessed in connection with border measures to enforce an intellectual property right, each Party shall provide that the fee shall not be set at an amount that unreasonably deters recourse to these measures. 


25. Each Party shall provide the other Party, on mutually agreed terms, with technical advice on the enforcement of border measures concerning intellectual property rights, and the Parties shall promote bilateral and regional cooperation on these matters. 
Criminal Procedures and Remedies 

26. Each Party shall provide for criminal procedures and penalties to be applied at least in cases of willful trademark counterfeiting or copyright or related rights piracy on a commercial scale. Willful copyright or related rights piracy on a commercial scale includes: 

(a) 	significant willful copyright or related rights infringements that have no direct or indirect motivation of financial gain; and 

31  For greater certainty, the Parties understand that ex officio action does not require a formal complaint from a private party or right holder. 

32  For purposes of paragraph 22, in-transit merchandise means goods under “Customs transit” and goods “transshipped,” as defined in the International Convention on the Simplification and Harmonization of Customs Procedures (Kyoto Convention). 

(b) 	willful infringements for purposes of commercial advantage or private financial gain.33 

Each Party shall treat willful importation or exportation of counterfeit or pirated goods as unlawful activities subject to criminal penalties.34 

27. 	Further to paragraph 26, each Party shall provide: 


(a) 	penalties that include sentences of imprisonment as well as monetary fines sufficient to provide a deterrent to future infringements, consistent with a policy of removing the infringer’s monetary incentive.  Each Party shall further encourage judicial authorities to impose those penalties at levels sufficient to provide a deterrent to future infringements, including the imposition of actual terms of imprisonment when criminal infringement occurs for purposes of commercial advantage or private financial gain; 


(b) 	that its judicial authorities shall have the authority to order the seizure of suspected counterfeit or pirated goods, any related materials and implements used in the commission of the offense, any documentary evidence relevant to the offense, and any assets traceable to the infringing activity.  Each Party shall provide that such orders need not individually identify the items that are subject to seizure, so long as they fall within general categories specified in the order; 


(c) 	that its judicial authorities shall have the authority to order, among other measures, the forfeiture of any assets traceable to the infringing activity; 


(d) 	that its judicial authorities shall, except in exceptional cases, order 


(i) 	the forfeiture and destruction of all counterfeit or pirated goods, and any articles consisting of a counterfeit mark; and  


(ii) 	the forfeiture and/or destruction of materials and implements that have been used in the creation of pirated or counterfeit goods. 
Each Party shall further provide that forfeiture and destruction under this subparagraph and subparagraph (c) shall occur without compensation of any kind to the defendant; 

(e) 	that, in criminal cases, its judicial or other competent authorities shall keep an inventory of goods and other material proposed to be destroyed, and shall have the authority temporarily to exempt these materials from the 

33  For purposes of paragraph 26 and Articles 18.4.7(a), 18.4.8(a), and 18.10.27 and for greater certainty, “financial gain” includes the receipt or expectation of anything of value. 

34 A Party may comply with the obligation in paragraph 26 in relation to exportation of pirated goods through its measures concerning distribution. 

destruction order to facilitate the preservation of evidence on notice by the right holder that it wishes to bring a civil or administrative case for damages; and 

(f) 	that its authorities may initiate legal action ex officio with respect to the offenses described in this Chapter, without the need for a formal complaint by a private party or right holder. 

28. Each Party shall also provide for criminal procedures and penalties to be applied, even absent willful trademark counterfeiting or copyright piracy, at least in cases of knowing trafficking in: 


(a) 	counterfeit labels or illicit labels affixed to, enclosing, or accompanying, or designed to be affixed to, enclose, or accompany: a phonogram, a copy of a computer program or other literary work, a copy of a motion picture or other audiovisual work, or documentation or packaging for such items; and 


(b) 	counterfeit documentation or packaging for items of the type described in subparagraph (a). 
29. Each Party shall also provide for criminal procedures to be applied against any person who, without authorization of the holder of copyright or related rights in a motion picture or other audiovisual work, knowingly uses or attempts to use an audiovisual recording device to transmit or make a copy of the motion picture or other audiovisual work, or any part thereof, from a performance of the motion picture or other audiovisual work in a public motion picture exhibition facility. 

Liability for Service Providers and Limitations 

30. For the purpose of providing enforcement procedures that permit effective action against any act of copyright infringement covered by this Chapter, including expeditious remedies to prevent infringements and criminal and civil remedies that constitute a deterrent to further infringements, each Party shall provide, consistent with the framework set out in this Article:  


(a) 	legal incentives for service providers to cooperate with copyright35 owners in deterring the unauthorized storage and transmission of copyrighted materials; and 


(b) 	limitations in its law regarding the scope of remedies available against service providers for copyright infringements that they do not control, initiate, or direct, and that take place through systems or networks controlled or operated by them or on their behalf, as set forth in this subparagraph (b).36 
35  For purposes of paragraph 30, “copyright” includes related rights. 

36  Subparagraph (b) is without prejudice to the availability of defenses to copyright infringement that are of general applicability. 


(i) 	These limitations shall preclude monetary relief and provide reasonable restrictions on court-ordered relief to compel or restrain certain actions for the following functions, and shall be confined to those functions:37 


(A) 	transmitting, routing, or providing connections for material without modification of its content, or the intermediate and transient storage of such material in the course thereof; 


(B) 	caching carried out through an automatic process; 


(C) 	storage at the direction of a user of material residing on a system or network controlled or operated by or for the service provider; and 


(D) 	referring or linking users to an online location by using information location tools, including hyperlinks and directories. 

(ii) 	These limitations shall apply only where the service provider does not initiate the chain of transmission of the material, and does not select the material or its recipients (except to the extent that a function described in clause (i)(D) in itself entails some form of selection). 
(iii) 	Qualification by a service provider for the limitations as to each function in clauses (i)(A) through (D) shall be considered separately from qualification for the limitations as to each other function, in accordance with the conditions for qualification set forth in clauses (iv) through (vii). 

(iv) 	With respect to functions referred to in clause (i)(B), the limitations shall be conditioned on the service provider:  


(A) 	permitting access to cached material in significant part only to users of its system or network who have met conditions on user access to that material; 


(B) 	complying with rules concerning the refreshing, reloading, or other updating of the cached material when specified by the person making the material available online in accordance with a generally accepted industry standard data communications protocol for the system or network through which that person makes the material available; 
37  Either Party may request consultations with the other Party to consider how to address under subparagraph (b) functions of a similar nature that a Party identifies after the date this Agreement enters into force. 


(C) 	not interfering with technology consistent with industry standards accepted in the Party’s territory used at the originating site to obtain information about the use of the material, and not modifying its content in transmission to subsequent users; and

(A) 	not receiving a financial benefit directly attributable to the infringing activity, in circumstances where it has the right and ability to control such activity; 


(B) 	expeditiously removing or disabling access to the material residing on its system or network on obtaining actual knowledge of the infringement or becoming aware of facts or circumstances from which the infringement was apparent, such as through effective notifications of claimed infringement in accordance with clause (ix); and

(vi) 	Eligibility for the limitations in this subparagraph shall be conditioned on the service provider: 


(A) 	adopting and reasonably implementing a policy that provides for termination in appropriate circumstances of the accounts of repeat infringers; and 


(B) 	accommodating and not interfering with standard technical measures accepted in the Party’s territory that protect and identify copyrighted material, that are developed through an open, voluntary process by a broad consensus of copyright owners and service providers, that are available on reasonable and nondiscriminatory terms, and that do not impose substantial costs on service providers or substantial burdens on their systems or networks.  
(vii) 	Eligibility for the limitations in this subparagraph may not be conditioned on the service provider monitoring its service, or affirmatively seeking facts indicating infringing activity, except to the extent consistent with such technical measures.

Each Party shall also provide for monetary remedies against any person who makes a knowing material misrepresentation in a notification or counter-notification that causes injury to any interested party as a result of a service provider relying on the misrepresentation.  


(x) 	If the service provider removes or disables access to material in good faith based on claimed or apparent infringement, each Party shall provide that the service provider shall be exempted from liability for any resulting claims, provided that, in the case of material residing on its system or network, it takes reasonable steps promptly to notify the person making the material available on its system or network that it has done so and, if such person makes an effective counter-notification and is subject to jurisdiction in an infringement suit, to restore the material online unless the person giving the original effective notification seeks judicial relief within a reasonable time.   


(xi) 	Each Party shall establish an administrative or judicial procedure enabling copyright owners who have given effective notification of claimed infringement to obtain expeditiously from a service provider information in its possession identifying the alleged infringer. 
(xii) 	For purposes of the function referred to in clause (i)(A), service provider means a provider of transmission, routing, or connections for digital online communications without modification of their content between or among points specified by the user of material of the user’s choosing, and for purposes of the functions referred to in clauses (i)(B) through (D) service provider means a provider or operator of facilities for online services or network access.</article>
