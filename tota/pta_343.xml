2. At the request of a disputing party, and unless the disputing parties otherwise agree, the tribunal may determine the place of meetings, including consultations and hearings, taking into consideration appropriate factors, including the convenience of the parties and the arbitrators, the location of the subject matter, and the proximity of evidence. The preceding sentence is without prejudice to any appropriate factors a tribunal may consider under paragraph 1. 


3. Unless the disputing parties otherwise agree, English and Korean shall be the official languages to be used in the entire arbitration proceedings, including all hearings, submissions, decisions, and awards. 


4. The non-disputing Party may make oral and written submissions to the tribunal regarding the interpretation of this Agreement. On request of a disputing party, the non-disputing Party should resubmit its oral submission in writing. 


5. After consulting the disputing parties, the tribunal may allow a party or entity that is not a disputing party to file a written amicus curiae submission with the tribunal regarding a matter within the scope of the dispute. In determining whether to allow such a filing, the tribunal shall consider, among other things, the extent to which: 


(a) 	the amicus curiae submission would assist the tribunal in the determination of a factual or legal issue related to the proceeding by bringing a perspective, particular knowledge, or insight that is different from that of the disputing parties; 


(b) 	the amicus curiae submission would address a matter within the scope of the dispute; and 


(c) 	the amicus curiae has a significant interest in the proceeding. 
The tribunal shall ensure that the amicus curiae submission does not disrupt the proceeding or unduly burden or unfairly prejudice either disputing party, and that the disputing parties are given an opportunity to present their observations on the amicus curiae submission. 

6. Without prejudice to a tribunal‟s authority to address other objections as a preliminary question, a tribunal shall address and decide as a preliminary question any objection by the respondent that, as a matter of law, a claim submitted is not a claim for which an award in favour of the claimant may be made under Article 11.26: 


(a) 	such objection shall be submitted to the tribunal as soon as possible after the tribunal is constituted, and in no event later than the date the tribunal fixes for the respondent to submit its counter-memorial or, in the case of an amendment to the notice of arbitration, the date the tribunal fixes for the respondent to submit its response to the amendment; 


(b) 	on receipt of an objection under this paragraph, the tribunal shall suspend any proceedings on the merits, establish a schedule for considering the objection consistent with any schedule it has established for considering any other preliminary question, and issue a decision or award on the objection, stating the grounds therefor; 


(c) 	in deciding an objection under this paragraph, the tribunal shall assume to be true 
the claimant‟s factual allegations in support of any claim in the notice of 

arbitration (or any amendment thereof) and, in disputes brought under the UNCITRAL Arbitration Rules, the statement of claim referred to in Article 18 of the UNCITRAL Arbitration Rules. The tribunal may also consider any relevant facts not in dispute; 

(d) 	the respondent does not waive any objection as to competence or any argument on the merits merely because the respondent did or did not raise an objection under this paragraph or make use of the expedited procedure set out in paragraph 7. 

7. In the event that the respondent so requests within 45 days of the date the tribunal is constituted, the tribunal shall decide on an expedited basis an objection under paragraph 6 and 

any objection that the dispute is not within the tribunal‟s competence. The tribunal shall suspend 

any proceedings on the merits and issue a decision or award on the objection(s), stating the grounds therefor, no later than 150 days after the date of the request. However, if a disputing party requests a hearing, the tribunal may take an additional 30 days to issue the decision or award. Regardless of whether a hearing is requested, a tribunal may, on a showing of extraordinary cause, delay issuing its decision or award by an additional brief period, which may not exceed 30 days. 

8. When it decides a respondent‟s objection under paragraph 6 or 7, the tribunal may, if warranted, award to the prevailing disputing party reasonable costs and attorney‟s fees incurred in submitting or opposing the objection. In determining whether such an award is warranted, the 

tribunal shall consider whether either the claimant‟s claim or the respondent‟s objection was 

frivolous, and shall provide the disputing parties a reasonable opportunity to comment. 


9. A respondent may not assert as a defence, counterclaim, or right of set-off, or for any other reason, that the claimant has received or will receive indemnification or other compensation for all or part of the alleged damages pursuant to an insurance or guarantee contract, except with respect to any subrogation as provided for in Article 11.14. 


10. A tribunal may order an interim measure of protection to preserve the rights of a disputing party, or to ensure that the tribunal‟s jurisdiction is made fully effective, including an order to preserve evidence in the possession or control of a disputing party or to protect the 
tribunal‟s jurisdiction. A tribunal may not order attachment or enjoin the application of a 

measure alleged to constitute a breach referred to in Article 11.16. For the purposes of this paragraph, an order includes a recommendation. 


11. In any arbitration conducted under this Section, on request of a disputing party, a tribunal shall, before issuing a decision or award on liability, transmit its proposed decision or award to the disputing parties and to the non-disputing Party. Within 60 days after the date the tribunal transmits its proposed decision or award, the disputing parties may submit written comments to the tribunal concerning any aspect of its proposed decision or award. The tribunal shall consider any such comments and issue its decision or award not later than 45 days after the date the 60 day comment period expires. 


12. Paragraph 11 shall not apply in any arbitration conducted pursuant to this Section for which an appeal has been made available pursuant to paragraph 13 or Annex 11-E. 


13. If a separate, multilateral agreement enters into force between the Parties that establishes an appellate body for the purposes of reviewing awards rendered by tribunals constituted pursuant to international trade or investment arrangements to hear investment disputes, the Parties shall strive to reach an agreement that would have such appellate body review awards rendered under Article 11.26 in arbitrations commenced after the multilateral agreement enters into force between the Parties.</article>

(d) 	the tribunal shall decide any objection by a disputing party regarding the designation of information claimed to be protected information. If the tribunal determines that such information was not properly designated, the disputing party that submitted the information may: 


(i) 	withdraw all or part of its submission containing such information; or 


(ii) 	agree to resubmit complete and redacted documents with corrected 
designations in accordance with the tribunal‟s determination and 

subparagraph (c), 

in either case, the other disputing party shall, whenever necessary, resubmit complete and redacted documents which either remove the information withdrawn under subparagraph (d)(i) by the disputing party that first submitted the information or redesignate the information consistent with the designation under subparagraph (d)(ii) of the disputing party that first submitted the information; and 

(e) 	on request of a disputing Party, the Joint Committee shall consider issuing a decision in writing regarding a determination by the tribunal that information claimed to be protected was not properly designated. If the Joint Committee issues a decision within 60 days of such a request, it shall be binding on the tribunal, and any decision or award issued by the tribunal must be consistent with that decision. If the Joint Committee does not issue a decision within 60 days, the tribunal‟s determination shall remain in effect only if the non-disputing Party submits a written statement to the Joint Committee within that period that it agrees with the tribunal‟s determination.

(f) 	for new construction services consisting of the repetition of similar construction services that conform to a basic project for which an initial contract was awarded following use of open tendering or selective tendering in accordance with this Chapter, and for which the procuring entity has indicated in the notice of procurement concerning the initial construction service that limited tendering procedures might be used in awarding contracts for such new construction services; 


(g) 	for purchases made under exceptionally advantageous conditions that only arise in the very short term, such as from unusual disposals, unsolicited innovative proposals, liquidation, bankruptcy or receivership and not for routine purchases from regular suppliers; 


(h) 	in so far as is strictly necessary where, for reasons of extreme urgency brought about by events unforeseen by the procuring entity, the goods or services could not be obtained in time by means of an open or selective tendering procedure; or

3. A procuring entity shall not penalise any supplier whose tender is received after the time specified for receiving tenders if the delay is due solely to mishandling on the part of the procuring entity. 


4. Where a procuring entity provides suppliers with opportunities to correct unintentional errors of form between the opening of tenders and the awarding of the contract, the procuring entity shall provide the same opportunities to all participating suppliers. 


5. A procuring entity shall require that, in order to be considered for award, a tender be submitted in writing and, at the time of opening, conform to the essential requirements of the tender documentation. 


6.

More Extensive Protection and Enforcement 

5. A Party may provide more extensive protection for, and enforcement of, intellectual property rights under its law than this Chapter requires, provided that the more extensive protection does not contravene this Chapter. 

National Treatment 


6. In respect of all categories of intellectual property covered in this Chapter, each Party shall accord to nationals58 of the other Party treatment no less favourable than it accords to its own nationals with regard to the protection59 and enjoyment of such intellectual property rights and any benefits derived from such rights, subject to the exceptions provided in multilateral intellectual property agreements to which either Party is, or becomes, a contracting party. 


7. A Party may derogate from paragraph 6 in relation to its judicial and administrative procedures, including requiring a national of the other Party to designate an address for service of process in its territory, or to appoint an agent in its territory, provided that such derogation is:

identical or similar signs, including geographical indications, for goods or services that are 

identical or similar to those goods or services in respect of which the owner‟s trademark is 

registered, where such use would result in a likelihood of confusion. In the case of the use of an identical sign, for identical goods or services, a likelihood of confusion shall be presumed. 

60 A party may require an adequate description, which can be represented graphically, of the trademark. 

Exceptions to Trademark Rights 

4. Each Party may provide limited exceptions to the rights conferred by a trademark, such as fair use of descriptive terms, provided that such exceptions take account of the legitimate interests of the owner of the trademark and of third parties. 

Well-Known Trademarks 


5. Neither Party shall require, as a condition for determining that a trademark is a well-known mark, that the trademark has been registered in the territory of that Party or in another jurisdiction. 


6. Article 6bis of the Paris Convention for the Protection of Industrial Property, done at Paris on 20 March 1883, shall apply, mutatis mutandis, to goods or services that are not identical or similar to those identified by a well-known trademark61, whether registered or not, provided that use of that trademark in relation to those goods or services would indicate a connection between those goods or services and the owner of the trademark, and provided that the interests of the owner of the trademark are likely to be damaged by such use. 


7. Each Party shall provide for appropriate measures to refuse or cancel the registration and prohibit the use of a trademark that is identical or similar to a well-known trademark, for related goods or services, if the use of that trademark is likely to cause confusion or is likely to deceive.

64 For the purposes of this Chapter, with respect to copyright and related rights, a “performance” means a 

performance fixed in a phonogram unless otherwise specified. 

65 Each Party shall confine limitations or exceptions to the rights described in paragraph 1 to certain special cases that do not conflict with a normal exploitation of the work, performance, phonogram or broadcast and do not unreasonably prejudice the legitimate interests of the right holder. For greater certainty, each Party may adopt or maintain limitations or exceptions to the rights described in paragraph 1 for fair use, as long as any such limitation or exception is confined as stated in the previous sentence. 


2. Each Party shall provide authors, performers and producers of phonograms with the right to authorise or prohibit the making available to the public of the original and copies66 of their works, performances and phonograms through sale or other transfer of ownership67.

Likewise, each Party shall provide that in cases where authorisation is needed from both the author of a work embodied in a phonogram or broadcast and a performer, producer or broadcasting organisation owning rights in the phonogram or broadcast, the need for the authorisation of the performer, producer or broadcasting organisation shall not cease to exist because the authorisation of the author is also required. 

Term of Protection 

5. Each Party shall provide that, where the term of protection of a work (including a photographic work), performance or phonogram is to be calculated: 

(a) 	on the basis of the life of a natural person, the term shall be not less than the life

Article 14.6 of the TRIPS Agreement, shall apply, mutatis mutandis, to the subject matter, rights, and obligations in this Article and Articles 13.6 and 13.7. 

8. Each Party shall provide that for copyright and related rights, any person acquiring or holding any economic right in a work, performance, phonogram or broadcast: 

66 The expression “copies” and “original and copies”, being subject to the right of distribution in this paragraph, 

refer exclusively to fixed copies that can be put into circulation as tangible objects. 

67 Nothing in this Agreement shall affect a Party‟s right to determine the conditions, if any, under which the exhaustion of this right applies after the first sale or other transfer of ownership of the original or a copy of their works, performances or phonograms with the authorisation of the right holder. 


(a) 	may freely and separately transfer that right by contract; and 


(b) 	by virtue of a contract, including contracts of employment underlying the creation of works, performances, phonograms and broadcasts, shall be able to exercise that

Application of Criminal Procedures and Penalties 


11. Each Party shall also provide for criminal procedures and penalties to be applied when any person, other than a non-profit library, archive, educational institution, or public noncommercial broadcasting entity, is found to have engaged wilfully and for the purposes of commercial advantage or financial gain in any of the activities prescribed in paragraphs 9 and 10. 


12.

Exceptions to Copyright and Related Rights 


13. With respect to this Article and Articles 13.6 and 13.7, each Party shall confine limitations or exceptions to exclusive rights to certain special cases that do not conflict with a normal exploitation of the work, performance, phonogram or broadcast, and do not unreasonably prejudice the legitimate interests of the right holder68.

(b) 	to broadcasting organisations, each Party shall accord those rights to the broadcasting organisations if the headquarters of the broadcasting organisations are situated in the other Party or the broadcast was transmitted from a transmitter situated in the other Party72. 

68 For greater certainty, this paragraph does not reduce the capacity of the Parties to provide for exceptions or limitations to exclusive rights in accordance with multilateral agreements related to intellectual property to which either Party is, or becomes, a party. 

69 For the purposes of paragraph 14 and for greater certainty, retransmission within a Party‟s territory over a closed, defined, subscriber network that is not accessible from outside the Party‟s territory shall not constitute retransmission on the Internet. 

70 For the purposes of Article 13.7, “fixation” includes the finalisation of the master tape or its equivalent. 

71 With respect to the protection of phonograms, a Party may apply the criterion of fixation instead of the criterion of publication.

Exclusion from Patentability 

Limited Exceptions to Patent Rights 

3. Each Party may provide limited exceptions to the exclusive rights conferred by a patent, provided that such exceptions do not unreasonably conflict with a normal exploitation of the patent and do not unreasonably prejudice the legitimate interests of the patent owner, taking account of the legitimate interests of third parties. 

Revocation of Patent

Grace Period for Patents 

5. Each Party shall disregard information contained in public disclosures used to determine if an invention is novel or has an inventive step if the public disclosure: 


(a) 	was made or authorised by, or derived from, the patent applicant; and

(ii) 	at least in the case of copyright or related rights infringement and trademark counterfeiting, the profits of the infringer that are attributable to the infringement, which may be presumed to be the amount of damages referred to in subparagraph (a)(i); and 
(b) 	in determining damages for infringement of intellectual property rights, its judicial authorities may consider, inter alia, the value of the infringed good or service, measured by the market price, the suggested retail price, or other legitimate measure of value submitted by the right holder. 


7.

(c) 	in regard to counterfeit trademarked goods, the simple removal of the trademark unlawfully affixed shall not be sufficient to permit the release of goods into the channels of commerce.

order to satisfy themselves with a sufficient degree of certainty that the applicant‟s right is being infringed or that such infringement is imminent, and to order the applicant to provide a reasonable security or equivalent assurance set at a level sufficient to protect the defendant and to prevent abuse, and so as not to unreasonably deter recourse to such procedures. 

Special Requirements Related to Border Measures 

18. Each Party shall provide that any right holder initiating procedures for its customs authorities to suspend release of suspected counterfeit or confusingly similar trademark goods, or pirated copyright goods80 into free circulation is required to provide adequate evidence to satisfy the competent authorities that, under the law of the importing Party, there is prima facie an infringement of the right holder's intellectual property right and to supply sufficient information 

that may reasonably be expected to be within the right holder‟s knowledge to make the suspected 

goods reasonably recognisable by its customs authorities. The requirement to provide sufficient information shall not unreasonably deter recourse to these procedures. Each Party shall provide that the application to suspend the release of goods shall apply to all points of entry to its territory and remain applicable for a period of not less than one year from the date of application, or the period that the good is protected by copyright or that the relevant trademark registration is valid, whichever is shorter.

Each Party shall provide that its competent authorities shall have the authority to require a right holder initiating procedures to suspend the release of suspected counterfeit or confusingly similar trademark goods, or pirated copyright goods, to provide a reasonable security or equivalent assurance sufficient to protect the defendant and the competent authorities and to prevent abuse. Each Party shall provide that the security or equivalent assurance shall not unreasonably deter recourse to these procedures. Each Party may provide that the security may be in the form of a bond conditioned to hold the importer or owner of the imported merchandise harmless from any loss or damage resulting from any suspension of the release of goods in the event the competent authorities determine that the article is not an infringing good. 


20.

80 For the purposes of paragraphs 18 through 24: 


(a) 	“counterfeit trademark goods” means any goods, including packaging, bearing without authorisation a trademark that is identical to the trademark validly registered in respect of such goods, or that cannot be distinguished in its essential aspects from such a trademark, and that thereby infringes the rights of the owner of the trademark in question under the law of the country of importation; and 


(b) 	“pirated copyright goods” means any goods that are copies made without the consent of the right holder or person duly authorised by the right holder in the country of production and that are made directly or indirectly from an article where the making of that copy would have constituted an infringement of a copyright or a related right under the law of the country of importation. 
81 For greater certainty, the Parties understand that ex officio action does not require a formal complaint from a private party or right holder. 

exceptional circumstances. In regard to counterfeit trademark goods, the simple removal of the trademark unlawfully affixed shall not be sufficient to permit the release of the goods into the channels of commerce. In no event shall the competent authorities be authorised, except in exceptional circumstances, to permit the exportation of counterfeit or pirated goods or to permit such goods to be subject to other customs procedures. 


23. Where an application fee or merchandise storage fee is assessed in connection with border measures to enforce a trademark or copyright, each Party shall provide that the fee shall not be set at an amount that unreasonably deters recourse to these measures. 


24. Each Party shall provide the other Party, on mutually agreed terms, with technical advice on the enforcement of border measures concerning intellectual property rights, and the Parties shall promote bilateral and regional cooperation on these matters. 
Criminal Procedures and Remedies 


25. Each Party shall provide for criminal procedures and penalties to be applied at least in cases of wilful trademark counterfeiting or copyright or related rights piracy on a commercial scale.

26. 	Further to paragraph 25, each Party shall provide: 


(a) 	penalties that include sentences of imprisonment as well as monetary fines sufficient to provide a deterrent to future infringements, consistent with a policy of removing the infringer‟s monetary incentive. Each Party shall further encourage judicial authorities to impose those penalties at levels sufficient to provide a deterrent to future infringements; 


(b) 	that its judicial authorities shall have the authority to order the seizure of suspected counterfeit or pirated goods, any related materials and implements used in the commission of the offense, any documentary evidence relevant to the offense, and any assets traceable to the infringing activity. Each Party shall provide that such orders need not individually identify the items that are subject to seizure, so long as they fall within general categories specified in the order; 


(c) 	that its judicial authorities shall have the authority to order, among other measures, the forfeiture of any assets traceable to the infringing activity83; and 


(d) 	that its judicial authorities shall have the authority to order: 


(i) 	the forfeiture and destruction of all counterfeit or pirated goods; and 


(ii) 	at least with respect to wilful copyright and related rights piracy and counterfeiting on a commercial scale, the forfeiture and/or destruction of materials and implements that have been predominantly used in the creation of pirated or counterfeit goods. 
82 A Party may comply with the obligation in paragraph 25 in relation to exportation of counterfeit or pirated goods through its measures concerning distribution. 

83 Forthe purposes of Australia‟s obligations under this paragraph, its judicial authorities shall only be required to order the forfeiture of any assets traceable to an infringing activity in respect of at least offences defined as indictable offences under its law. 

Each Party shall further provide that forfeiture and destruction under subparagraphs (c) and (d) 

shall occur without compensation of any kind to the defendant. 

27. Each Party shall provide for criminal procedures and penalties to be applied against any person who, without authorisation of the holder of copyright or related rights in a cinematographic work, knowingly makes a copy of or transmits to the public the cinematographic work, from a performance of the cinematographic work, in an exhibition facility open to the public84.

(a) 	legal incentives for online service providers to cooperate with copyright85 owners in deterring the unauthorised storage and transmission of copyrighted materials; and 


(b) 	limitations in its law regarding the scope of remedies available against online service providers for copyright infringements that they do not control, initiate or direct, and that take place through systems or networks controlled or operated by them or on their behalf.</article>

(b) 	a complaining Party that considers it is not practicable or effective to suspend benefits in the same sector or sectors may suspend benefits in other sectors.

(a) 	the level of benefits that the complaining Party has proposed to be suspended is not equivalent to the level of non-conformity, or nullification or impairment that the panel has found; or 


(b) 	it has eliminated the non-conformity, or the nullification or impairment that the panel has found, 
it may, within 30 days of the date the complaining Party provides notification under paragraph 2, request that the panel be reconvened to consider the matter.

6. Where the right to suspend benefits has been exercised under this Article, if the Party complained against considers that the level of benefits suspended by the complaining Party is not equivalent to the level of non-conformity, or the nullification or impairment that the panel has found, it may request that the panel be reconvened to consider the matter. Where the panel reconvenes in accordance with this paragraph, the timeframes in paragraph 5 shall apply. If the panel determines that the level of benefits suspended by the complaining Party is not equivalent to the level of non-conformity, or nullification or impairment that the panel has found, it shall determine the level of benefits it considers to be equivalent to the level of non-conformity, or nullification or impairment. 


7. The complaining Party may suspend benefits up to the level the panel has determined under paragraph 5 or 6 or, if the panel has not determined the level, the level the Party has proposed to suspend under paragraph 2, unless the panel has determined that the Party complained against has eliminated the non-conformity, or the nullification or impairment.</article>
