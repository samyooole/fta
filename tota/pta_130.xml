      <article article_identifier="11295">AGREEMENT between the European Economic Community and the Republic of
  Iceland

  THE EUROPEAN ECONOMIC COMMUNITY,

  of the one part, and

  THE REPUBLIC OF ICELAND,

  of the other part,

  DESIRING to consolidate and to extend, upon the enlargement of the
  European Economic Community, the economic relations existing between
  the Community and Iceland and to ensure, with due regard for fair
  conditions of competition, the harmonious development of their
  commerce for the purpose of contributing to the work of constructing
  Europe,

  RESOLVED to this end to eliminate progressively the obstacles to
  substantially all their trade, in accordance with the provisions of
  the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade concerning the
  establishment of free trade areas,

  DECLARING their readiness to examine, in the light of any relevant
  factor, and in particular of developments in the Community, the
  possibility of developing and deepening their relations where it would
  appear to be useful in the interests of their economies to extend them
  to fields not covered by this Agreement,

  HAVE DECIDED, in pursuit of these objectives and considering that no
  provision of this Agreement may be interpreted as exempting the
  Contracting Parties from the obligations which are incumbent upon them
  under other international agreements,

  TO CONCLUDE THIS AGREEMENT:</article>
    </chapter>
    <chapter chapter_identifier="1388">
      <article number="ARTICLE 1" article_identifier="11296">The aim of this Agreement is: (a) to promote through the expansion of
  reciprocal trade the harmonious development of economic relations
  between the European Economic Community and the Republic of Iceland
  and thus to foster in the Community and in Iceland the advance of
  economic activity, the improvement of living and employment
  conditions, and increased productivity and financial stability,

  (b) to provide fair conditions of competition for trade between the
  Contracting Parties,

  (c) to contribute in this way, by the removal of barriers to trade, to
  the harmonious development and expansion of world trade.</article>
      <article number="ARTICLE 2" article_identifier="11297">The Agreement shall apply to products originating in the Community or
  Iceland: (i) which fall within Chapters 25 to 99 of the Brussels
  Nomenclature, excluding the products listed in Annex I;

  (ii) which are specified in Protocols Nos 2 and 6, with due regard to
  the arrangements provided for in those Protocols.</article>
      <article number="ARTICLE 3" article_identifier="11298">1. No new customs duty on imports shall be introduced in trade between
  the Community and Iceland.

  2. The Community as originally constituted and Ireland shall
  progressively abolish customs duties on imports in accordance with the
  following timetable: (a) on 1 April 1973 each duty shall be reduced to
  80 % of the basic duty;

  (b) four further reductions of 20 % each shall be made on:

  1 January 1974,

  1 January 1975,

  1 January 1976,

  1 July 1977.

  3. The basic duty to which the successive reductions provided for in
  this Article and in Protocol No 1 are to be applied shall, for each
  product, be the duty actually applied on 1 January 1972.

  If, after 1 January 1972, any tariff reductions resulting from the
  tariff agreements concluded as a result of the Trade Conference held
  in Geneva from 1964 to 1967 become applicable, such reduced duties
  shall replace the basic duties referred to in the previous
  subparagraph.

  4. The reduced duties calculated in accordance with this Article and
  Protocol No 1 shall be applied rounded to the first decimal place.

  Subject to the application by the Community of Article 39 (5) of the
  "Act concerning the Conditions of Accession and the Adjustments
  to the Treaties" drawn up and adopted within the Conference
  between the European Communities and the Kingdom of Denmark, Ireland,
  the Kingdom of Norway and the United Kingdom of Great Britain and
  Northern Ireland, as regards the specific duties or the specific part
  of the mixed duties in the Irish Customs Tariff, this Article and
  Protocol No 1 shall be applied, with rounding to the fourth decimal
  place.</article>
      <article number="ARTICLE 4" article_identifier="11299">1. On the dates indicated Iceland shall reduce customs duties on
  imports from the Community as originally constituted and from Ireland
  to the rates of the various basic duties applicable on 1 March 1970
  specified below. &gt;PIC FILE= "T0010677"&gt;

  2. After 1 January 1974 Iceland shall continue to reduce customs
  duties in respect of Denmark, Norway and the United Kingdom in
  accordance with the timetable shown in paragraph 1.</article>

  duties on imports shall also apply to customs duties of a fiscal
  nature.

  or the fiscal element of a customs duty by an internal tax.

  2. Iceland may temporarily retain, with due regard to the conditions
  of Article 19, customs duties of a fiscal nature on the products
  specified in Annex II.

  When production is started in Iceland of a product of like kind to one
  of those listed in Annex II, the duty to which the latter product is
  subject must be reduced to the level which would have been reached if
  that duty had been reduced in accordance with the timetable contained
  in Article 4 (1) since the entry into force of the Agreement. If in
  respect of third countries a customs duty lower than the duty of a
  fiscal nature is introduced, the tariff reductions shall be made on
  the basis of the former duty.

  Subsequent reductions shall be made in accordance with the timetable
  laid down in Article 4 (1).

  3. Denmark, Ireland, Norway and the United Kingdom may retain until 1
  January 1976 a customs duty of a fiscal nature or the fiscal element
  of a customs duty upon implementation of Article 38 of the "Act
  concerning the Conditions of Accession and the Adjustments to the
  Treaties" drawn up and adopted within the Conference between the
  European Communities and the Kingdom of Denmark, Ireland, the Kingdom
  of Norway and the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern

  and Iceland shall be abolished upon the entry into force of the
  Agreement.

  applied on 1 January 1972, shall be reduced to the latter rate upon
  the entry into force of the Agreement.

  3. Charges having an effect equivalent to customs duties on imports
  shall be progressively abolished in accordance with the following
  timetable: (a) by 1 January 1974 at the latest each charge shall be
  reduced to 60 % of the rate applied on 1 January 1972;

  treatment, or which is considering the suspension of their
  application, shall, as far as may be practicable, notify the Joint

  appropriate measures under the conditions and in accordance with the
  procedures laid down in Article 28.</article>
      <article number="ARTICLE 24" article_identifier="11319">1. The following are incompatible with the proper functioning of the
  Agreement in so far as they may affect trade between the Community and

  undertakings which have as their object or effect the prevention,
  restriction or distortion of competition as regards the production of
  or trade in goods;

  certain goods.

  2. Should a Contracting Party consider that a given practice is
  incompatible with this Article, it may take appropriate measures under
  the conditions and in accordance with the procedures laid down in
  Article 28.</article>
      <article number="ARTICLE 25" article_identifier="11320">Where an increase in imports of a given product is or is likely to be
  seriously detrimental to any production activity carried on in the
  territory of one of the Contracting Parties and where this increase is
  due to: (i) the partial or total reduction in the importing
  Contracting Party, as provided for in the Agreement, of customs duties
  and charges having equivalent effect levied on the product in question
  ; and

  (ii) the fact that the duties or charges having equivalent effect
  levied by the exporting Contracting Party on imports of raw materials
  or intermediate products used in the manufacture of the product in
  question are significantly lower than the corresponding duties or
  charges levied by the importing Contracting Party;

  the Contracting Party concerned may take appropriate measures under
  the conditions and in accordance with the procedures laid down in
  Article 28.</article>
      <article number="ARTICLE 26" article_identifier="11321">If one of the Contracting Parties finds that dumping is taking place
  in trade with the other Contracting Party, it may take appropriate
  measures against this practice in accordance with the Agreement on
  Implementation of Article VI of the General Agreement on Tariffs and
  Trade, under the conditions and in accordance with the procedures laid
  down in Article 28.</article>
      <article number="ARTICLE 27" article_identifier="11322">If serious disturbances arise in any sector of the economy or if
  difficulties arise which could bring about serious deterioration in
  the economic situation of a region, the Contracting Party concerned
  may take appropriate measures under the conditions and in accordance
  with the procedures laid down in Article 28.</article>
      <article number="ARTICLE 28" article_identifier="11323">1. In the event of a Contracting Party subjecting imports of products
  liable to give rise to the difficulties referred to in Articles 25 and
  27 to an administrative procedure, the purpose of which is to provide
  rapid information on the trend of trade flows, it shall inform the
  other Contracting Party.

  2. In the cases specified in Articles 23 to 27, before taking the
  measures provided for therein or, in cases to which paragraph 3 (d)
  applies, as soon as possible, the Contracting Party in question shall
  supply the Joint Committee with all relevant information required for
  a thorough examination of the situation with a view to seeking a
  solution acceptable to the Contracting Parties.

  In the selection of measures, priority must be given to those which
  least disturb the functioning of the Agreement.

  The safeguard measures shall be notified immediately to the Joint
  Committee and shall be the subject of periodical consultations within
  the Committee, particularly with a view to their abolition as soon as
  circumstances permit.

  3. For the implementation of paragraph 2, the following provisions
  shall apply: (a) As regards Article 24, either Contracting Party may
  refer the matter to the Joint Committee if it considers that a given
  practice is incompatible with the proper functioning of the Agreement
  within the meaning of Article 24 (1).

  The Contracting Parties shall provide the Joint Committee with all
  relevant information and shall give it the assistance it requires in
  order to examine the case and, where appropriate, to eliminate the
  practice objected to.

  If the Contracting Party in question fails to put an end to the
  practice objected to within the period fixed by the Joint Committee,
  or in the absence of agreement in the Joint Committee within three
  months of the matter being referred to it, the Contracting Party
  concerned may adopt any safeguard measures it considers necessary to
  deal with the serious difficulties resulting from the practices in
  question ; in particular it may withdraw tariff concessions.

  (b) As regards Article 25, the difficulties arising from the situation
  referred to in that Article shall be referred for examination to the
  Joint Committee which may take any decision needed to put an end to
  such difficulties.

  If the Joint Committee or the exporting Contracting Party has not
  taken a decision putting an end to the difficulties within thirty days
  of the matter being referred, the importing Contracting Party is
  authorized to levy a compensatory charge on the product imported.

  The compensatory charge shall be calculated according to the incidence
  on the value of the goods in question of the tariff disparities in
  respect of the raw materials or intermediate products incorporated
  therein.

  (c) As regards Article 26, consultation in the Joint Committee shall
  take place before the Contracting Party concerned takes the
  appropriate measures.

  (d) Where exceptional circumstances requiring immediate action make
  prior examination impossible, the Contracting Party concerned may, in
  the situations specified in Articles 25, 26 and 27 and also in the
  case of export aids having a direct and immediate incidence on trade,
  apply forthwith the precautionary measures strictly necessary to
  remedy the situation.</article>
      <article number="ARTICLE 29" article_identifier="11324">Where one or more Member States of the Community or Iceland is in
  difficulties or is seriously threatened with difficulties as regards
  its balance of payments, the Contracting Party concerned may take the
  necessary safeguard measures. It shall inform the other Contracting
  Party forthwith.</article>

  Agreement.

  procedure.

  Party.

  The Contracting Parties may instruct the Joint Committee to examine
  this request and, where appropriate, to make recommendations to them,
