The Republic of Iceland, the Principality of Liechtenstein, the Kingdom of Norway, the Swiss Confederation (hereinafter called the EFTA States) 

and 

the Republic of Slovenia (hereinafter called Slovenia), 

Recalling their intention to participate actively in the process of economic integration in Europe and expressing their preparedness to co-operate in seeking ways and means to strengthen this process, 

Considering the importance of the links existing between the EFTA States and Slovenia, in particular the Declaration signed in Reykjav√≠k in May 1992, and recognizing the common wish to strengthen these links, thus establishing close and lasting relations, 

Recalling their firm commitment to the Final Act of the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe, the Charter of Paris for a new Europe, and in particular the principles contained in the final document of the CSCE Bonn Conference on Economic Co-operation in Europe, 

Reaffirming their commitment to pluralistic democracy based on the rule of law, human rights, including rights of persons belonging to minorities, and fundamental freedoms, and recalling their membership in the Council of Europe, 

Desiring to create favourable conditions for the development and diversification of trade between them and for the promotion of commercial and economic co-operation in areas of common interest on the basis of equality, mutual benefit, Most-Favoured-Nation Treatment and international law, 

Resolved to contribute to the strengthening of the multilateral trading system and to develop their relations in the field of trade in accordance with the basic principles of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) and the Agreement Establishing the World Trade Organization (WTO), 

Considering that no provision of this Agreement may be interpreted as exempting the States Parties to this Agreement from their obligations under other international agreements, especially GATT and WTO, 

Determined to implement this Free Trade Agreement with the objective to preserve and protect the environment and to ensure an optimal use of natural resources in accordance with the principle of sustainable growth, 

Firmly convinced that this Free Trade Agreement will foster the creation of an enlarged and harmonious free trade area within Europe, thus constituting an important contribution to European integration,

Preference shall be given to price-based measures which shall be progressively relaxed as balance of payments conditions improve and eliminated when conditions no longer 

justify their maintenance. The EFTA State or Slovenia, as the case may be, shall inform the other States Parties to this Agreement and the Joint Committee forthwith of their introduction and of a time schedule for their removal.

      <article number="ARTICLE 25" name="Procedure For The Application Of Safeguard Measures" article_identifier="20292">1.

2. Without prejudice to paragraph 6 of the present Article, a State Party which considers resorting to safeguard measures shall promptly notify the other States Parties and the Joint Committee thereof and supply all relevant information. Consultations between the States Parties to this Agreement shall take place without delay in the Joint Committee with a view to finding a commonly acceptable solution. 


3. 	(a) As regards Articles 17 (Rules of competition concerning undertakings) and 18 (State aid), the States Parties concerned shall give to the Joint Committee all the assistance required in order to examine the case and, where appropriate, eliminate the practice objected to. If the State Party in question fails to put an end to the practice objected to within the period fixed by the Joint Committee or if the Joint Committee fails to reach an agreement after consultations, or after thirty days following referral for such consultations, the State Party concerned may adopt the appropriate measures to deal with the difficulties resulting from the practice in question. 


(b) 	As regards Articles 19 (Dumping), 20 (Emergency action on imports of particular products) and 22 (Re-export and serious shortage), the Joint Committee shall examine the case or the situation and may take any decision needed to put an end to the difficulties notified by the State Party concerned.

4. The safeguard measures taken shall be notified immediately to the States Parties to this Agreement and to the Joint Committee. They shall be restricted with regard to their extent and to their duration to what is strictly necessary in order to rectify the situation giving rise to their application and shall not be in excess of the injury caused by the practice or the difficulty in question.  Priority shall be given to such measures as will least disturb the functioning of the Agreement. The measures taken by Slovenia against an action or an omission of an EFTA State may only affect the trade with that State. The measures taken against an action or omission of Slovenia may be only taken by that or those EFTA States the trade of which is affected by the said action or omission. 


5. The safeguard measures taken shall be the object of regular consultations within the Joint Committee with a view to their relaxation, substitution or abolition, when conditions no longer justify their maintenance. 


6. Where exceptional circumstances requiring immediate action make prior examination impossible, the State Party concerned may, in the cases of Articles 19 (Dumping), 20 (Emergency action on imports of particular products) and 22 (Re-export and serious shortage) and in cases of state aid having a direct and immediate incidence on trade between the States Parties, apply forthwith the precautionary and provisional measures strictly necessary to remedy the situation.
