The Republic of Austria, the Republic of Finland, the Republic of 
Iceland, the Principality of Liechtenstein, the Kingdom of Norway, the 
Kingdom of Sweden, the Swiss Confederation (hereinafter called the EFTA 
States) 


and 


Romania, 


Recalling their intention to participate actively in the process of 
economic integration in Europe and expressing their preparedness to 
co-operate in seeking ways and means to strengthen this process, 


Considering the importance of the links existing between the EFTA 
States and Romania and the common values they share, and recognizing that 
the EFTA States and Romania wish to strengthen these links and to establish 
close and lasting relations, 


Having regard to the Declaration signed by the EFTA States and Romania 
in Geneva in December 1991, 


Recalling their firm commitment to the Final Act of the Conference on 
Security and Co-operation in Europe, the Charter of Paris for a new Europe, 
and in particular the principles contained in the final document of the 
CSCE Bonn Confarence on Economic Co-operation in Europe, 


Reaffirming their commitment to pluralistic democracy based on the 
rule of law, human rights, including the rights of persons belonging to 
minorities, and fundamental freedoms, 


Firmly convinced that this Agreement will foster the creation of an 
enlarged and harmonious free trade area within Europe, thus constituting an 
important contribution to European integration, 


Resolved to this end to eliminate progressively the obstacles to 
substantially all their trade, in accordance with the General Agreement on 
Tariffs and Trade, 


Declaring their readiness to examine, in the light of any relevant 
factor, the possibility of developing and deepening their relations in 
order to extend them to fields not covered by this Agreement, 


Considering that no provision of this Agreement may be interpreted as 
exempting the States Parties to this Agreement from their obligations under 
other international agreements, especially the General Agreement on Tariffs 
and Trade, 


Have decided, in pursuit of the above, to conclude this Agreement:</article>

national treasures possessing artistic, historic or archaeological value; 


the protection of intellectual property; rules relating to gold or silver; 
or the conservation of exhaustible natural resources, if such measures are 
made effective in conjunction with restrictions on domestic production or 
consumption. Such prohibitions or restrictions shall not, however, 
constitute a means of arbitrary discrimination or a disguised restriction 
on trade between the States Parties to this Agreement.</article>
      <article number="ARTICLE 11" name="State Monopolies" article_identifier="20236">1. The States Parties to this Agreement shall ensure that any state

laid down in Protocol D, so that no discrimination regarding the conditions 
under which goods are procured and marketed will exist between nationals of 
the EFTA States and of Romania. 



2. The provisions of this Article shall apply to any body through which 
the competent authorities of the States Parties to this Agreement, in law 
or in fact, either directly or indirectly supervise, determine or 
appreciably influence imports or exports between the States Parties to this 
Agreement. These provisions shall likewise apply to monopolies delegated 
by the State to others.</article>

respective public procurement markets according to the Agreement on 
Government Procurement of 12 April 1979, as amended by a Protocol of 
Amendments of 2 February 1987, negotiated under the auspices of the General

States Parties to this Agreement shall progressively develop and adjust the

the field of the protection of intellectual property rights. 



3. In the field of intellectual property, the States Parties to this 
Agreement shall not grant treatment less favourable to each others' 
nationals than that accorded to nationals of any other State. Any 
advantage, favour, privilege or immunity deriving from: 



(a) 	bilateral agreements in force for a State Party to this Agreement 
at the entry into force of this Agreement as notified to the 
other States Parties by 1 January 1994, 



(b) 	existing and future multilateral agreements, including regional 
agreements on economic integration, to which not all of the 
States Parties to this Agreement are Parties, 

may be exempted from this obligation, provided that it does not constitute 
an arbitrary or unjustifiable discrimination of nationals of the other 
States Parties. 



4. Two or more States Parties to this Agreement may conclude further 
agreements exceeding the requirements of this Agreement, provided that such 
agreements shall be open to all other States Parties to this Agreement on 
terms equivalent to those under the agreements and that they shall be ready

Agreement in so far as they may affect trade between an EFTA State and 
Romania: 



(a) 	all agreements between undertakings, decisions by associations of 
undertakings and concerted practices between undertakings which 
have as their object or effect the prevention, restriction or 
distortion of competition;

territories of the States Parties to this Agreement as a whole or 
in a substantial part thereof. 


2. As from the third year from the entry into force of this Agreement, 
the provisions of paragraph 1 shall also apply to the activities of public 
undertakings, and undertakings for which the Parties grant special or 
exclusive rights, in so far as the application of these provisions does not 
obstruct the performance, in law or in fact, of the particular public tasks 
assigned to them. 



3. If a State Party to this Agreement considers that a given practice is 
incompatible with the provisions of paragraphs 1 and 2 and if such practice 
causes or threatens to cause serious prejudice to the interest of that 
State Party or material injury to its domestic industry, it may take 
appropriate measures after consultations within the Joint Committee or 
after thirty days following referral for such consultation.</article>
      <article number="ARTICLE 19" name="State Aid" article_identifier="20244">1. Any aid granted by a State Party to this Agreement or through State 
resources in any form whatsoever which distorts or threatens to distort 
competition by favouring certain undertakings or the production of certain 
goods shall, in so far as it may affect trade between an EFTA State and 
Romania, be incompatible with the proper functioning of this Agreement. 



2. Any practices contrary to paragraph 1 should be assessed on the basis 
of criteria set out in Annex XII. 



3. For the purpose of applying the provisions of paragraphs 1 and 2, the 
States Parties to this Agreement recognize that during the first five years 
after the entry into force of this Agreement Romania shall be regarded as 
an area where the standard of living is abnormally low or where there is 
serious unemployment, implying that Romania may grant aid with a higher 
intensity than would be tolerated for EFTA States according to the criteria 
set out in Annex XII. The Joint Committee may, taking into account the 
economic situation of Romania, decide on a prolongation of the application 
of this provision. 



4. The States Parties to this Agreement shall ensure transparency of 
state aid measures by exchanging information as provided in Annex XIII. 



5. If a State Party to this Agreement considers that a given practice is 
incompatible with the provisions of paragraph 1, it may take appropriate 
measures against this practice, which shall not be in excess of the injury 
caused by the practice, under the conditions and in accordance with the 
procedures laid down in Article 25.</article>
      <article number="ARTICLE 20" name="Dumping" article_identifier="20245">If an EFTA State finds that dumping within the meaning of Article VI 
of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade is taking place in trade with 
Romania, or if Romania finds that dumping within this meaning is taking 
place in trade with an EFTA State, the State Party concerned may take 
appropriate measures against this practice in accordance with the Agreement 
on Implementation of Article VI of the General Agreement on Tariffs and 
Trade and with the procedure laid down in Article 25.</article>
      <article number="ARTICLE 21" name="Emergency Action On Imports Of Particular Products." article_identifier="20246">Where any product is being imported in such increased quantities and 
under such conditions as to cause, or threaten to cause: 



(a) 	serious injury to domestic producers of like or directly 
competitive products in the territory of the importing State 
Party to this Agreement, or 



(b) 	serious disturbances in any sector of the economy or difficulties 
which could bring about serious deterioration in the economic 
situation of a region, 

the State Party concerned may take appropriate measures under the 
conditions and in accordance with the procedure laid down in Article 25.</article>
      <article number="ARTICLE 22" name="Structural Adjustment" article_identifier="20247">1. Exceptional measures of limited duration which derogate from the 
provisions of Article 4 may be taken by Romania in the form of increased 
customs duties. 



2. These measures may only concern infant industries, or certain sectors 
undergoing restructuring or facing serious difficulties, particularly where 
these difficulties produce important social problems. 



3. Customs duties on imports applicable in Romania to products 
originating in the EFTA States introduced by these measures may not exceed 
25 per cent ad valorem and shall maintain an element of preference for 
products originating in the EFTA States. The total value of imports of the 
products which are subject to these measures may not exceed 15 per cent of 
total imports of industrial products from the EFTA States, as defined in 
Article 2, during the last year for which statistics are available. 



4. These measures shall be applied for a period not exceeding five years 
unless a longer duration is authorized by the Joint Committee. They shall 
cease to apply at the latest at the expiration of the transitional period. 



5. No such measures can be introduced in respect of a product if more 
than three years have elapsed since the elimination of all duties and 
quantitative restrictions or charges or measures having an equivalent 
effect concerning that product. 



6. Romania shall inform the Joint Committee of any exceptional measures 
it intends to take and, at the request of the EFTA States, consultations 
shall be held in the Joint Committee on such measures and the sectors to 
which they apply before they are applied. When taking such measures 
Romania shall provide the Joint Committee with a schedule for the 
elimination of the customs duties introduced under this Article. This 
schedule shall provide for a phasing out of these duties starting at the 
latest two years after their introduction, at equal annual rates. The 
Joint Committee may decide on a different schedule.</article>
      <article number="ARTICLE 23" name="Re-Export And Serious Shortage" article_identifier="20248">Where compliance with the provisions of Articles 7 and 9 leads to: 



(a) 	re-export towards a third country against which the exporting 
State Party to this Agreement maintains for the product concerned 
quantitative export restrictions, export duties or measures or 
charges having equivalent effect; or 



(b) 	a serious shortage, or threat thereof, of a product essential to 
the exporting State Party to this Agreement; 

and where the situations referred to above give rise or are likely to give 
rise to major difficulties for the exporting Sate Party, that State Party 
may take appropriate measures under the conditions and in accordance with 
the procedures laid down in Article 25. The measures shall be 
non-discriminatory and be eliminated when conditions no longer justify 
their maintenance.</article>
      <article number="ARTICLE 24" name="Balance Of Payments Difficulties" article_identifier="20249">1. Where an EFTA State or Romania is in serious balance of payments 
difficulties, or under imminent threat thereof, the EFTA State or Romania, 
as the case may be, may, in accordance with the conditions established 
under the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, adopt trade restrictive 
measures, which shall be of limited duration and may not go beyond what is 
necessary to remedy the balance of payments situation. The measures shall 
be progressively relaxed as balance of payments conditions improve and they 
shall be eliminated when conditions no longer justify this maintenance. 
The EFTA State or Romania, as the case may be, shall inform the other 
States Parties to this Agreement and the Joint Committee forthwith of their 
introduction and whenever practicable, of a time schedule for their 
removal. 



2. The States Parties to this Agreement shall, nevertheless, endeavour to 
avoid the imposition of restrictive measures for balance of payments 
purposes.</article>
      <article number="ARTICLE 25" name="Procedure For The Application Of Safeguard Measures" article_identifier="20250">1. Before initiating the procedure for the application of safeguard 
measures set out in the following paragraphs of the present Article, the 
States Parties to this Agreement shall endeavour to solve any differences 
between them through direct consultations, and inform the other States 
Parties to this Agreement thereof. 



2. Without prejudice to paragraph 6 of the present Article, a State Party 
which considers resorting to safeguard measures shall promptly notify the 
other States Parties and the Joint Committee thereof and supply all 
relevant information. Consultations between the States Parties shall take 
place without delay in the Joint Committee with a view to finding a 
commonly acceptable solution. 



3. 	(a) As regards Article 19 the States Parties concerned shall give to 
the Joint Committee all the assistance required in order to 
examine the case and, where appropriate, eliminate the practice 
objected to. If the State Party in question fails to put an end 
to the practice objected to within the period fixed by the Joint 
Committee or if the Joint Committee fails to reach an agreement 
after consultations, or after thirty days following referral for 
such consultations, the State Party concerned may adopt the 
appropriate measures to deal with the difficulties resulting from 
the practice in question. 



(b) 	As regards Articles 20, 21 and 23, the Joint Committee shall 
examine the case or the situation and may take any decision 
needed to put an end to the difficulties notified by the State 
Party concerned. In the absence of such a decision within thirty 
days of the matter being referred to the Joint Committee, the 
State Party concerned may adopt the measures necessary in order 
to remedy the situation. 



(c) 	As regards Article 31, the State Party concerned shall supply the 
Joint Committee with all relevant information required for a 
thorough examination of the situation with a view to seeking a 
commonly acceptable solution. If the Joint Committee fails to 
reach such a solution or if a period of three months has elapsed 
from the date of notification, the State Party concerned may take 
appropriate measures. 


4. The safeguard measures taken shall be notified immediately to the 
States Parties to this Agreement and to the Joint Committee. They shall be 
restricted with regard to their extent and to their duration to what is 
strictly necessary in order to rectify the situation giving rise to their 
application and shall not be in excess of the injury caused by the practice 
or the difficulty in question. Priority shall be given to such measures as 
will least disturb the functioning of the Agreement. The measures taken by 
Romania against an action or an omission of an EFTA State may only affect 
the trade with that State. The measures taken against an action or 
omission of Romania may be only taken by that or those EFTA States the 
trade of which is affected by the said action or omission. 



5. The safeguard measures taken shall be the object of regular 
consultations within the Joint Committee with a view to their relaxation, 
substitution or abolition as soon as possible. 



6. Where exceptional circumstances requiring immediate action make prior 
examination impossible, the State Party concerned may, in the cases of 
Articles 20, 21 and 23 apply forthwith the precautionary and provisional 
measures strictly necessary to deal with the situation. The measures shall 

be notified without delay and consultations between the States Parties to 
this Agreement shall take place as soon as possible within the Joint 
Committee.</article>
      <article number="ARTICLE 26" name="Security Exceptions" article_identifier="20251">Nothing in this Agreement shall prevent a State Party to this 
Agreement from taking any measures which it considers necessary:

essential security interests; 



(b) 	for the protection of its essential security interests or for the 
implementation of international obligations or national policies 



(i) 	relating to the traffic in arms, ammunition and implements 
of war, provided that such measures do not impair the 
conditions of competition in respect of products not 
intended for specifically military purposes, and to such 
traffic in other goods, materials and services as is carried 
on directly or indirectly for the purpose of supplying a 
military establishment; or 



(ii) 	relating to the non-proliferation of biological and chemical 
weapons, nuclear weapons or other nuclear explosive devices; 
or 

(iii) 	taken in time of war or other serious international tension 
constituting threat of war.</article>
      <article number="ARTICLE 27" name="The Joint Committee" article_identifier="20252">1. The implementation of this Agreement shall be supervised and 
administered by the Joint Committee established under the Geneva 
Declaration, which will also have the powers and competences entrusted to 
the Joint Committee under this Agreement. 



2. For the purpose of the proper implementation of the Agreement, the 
States Parties to this Agreement shall exchange information and, at the 
request of any State Party to this Agreement, shall hold consultations 
within the Joint Committee. The Committee shall keep under review the 
possibility of further removal of the obstacles to trade between the EFTA 
States and Romania.
