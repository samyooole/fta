(iii) apply to non-residents or residents in order to prevent the avoidance or evasion of taxes, including compliance measures; or

(vi) determine, allocate or apportion income, profit, gain, loss, deduction or credit of resident persons or branches, or between related persons or branches of the same person, in order to safeguard the Member State’s tax base.
