  panel to rule on whether the benefits which the complaining Party
  intends to suspend are equivalent to those affected by the measure
  found to violate the covered legal instruments, and whether the

  ruling of the arbitration panel shall be given within 45 days from
  that request. Benefits shall not be suspended until the arbitration
  Panel has issued its ruling.

  implementing measures adopted after the suspension of benefits and, in
