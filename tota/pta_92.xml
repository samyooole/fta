Consultations between the Parties to this Agreement shall take place without delay in the Joint Committee with a view to finding a commonly acceptable solution. 


3. 	(a) As regards Articles 16 (Rules of competition concerning undertakings) and 17 (State aid), the Parties concerned shall give to the Joint Committee all the assistance required in order to examine the case and, where appropriate, eliminate the practice objected to.

If the Joint Committee fails to reach such a solution or if a period of three months has elapsed from the date of notification, the Party concerned may take appropriate measures. 

4. The safeguard measures taken shall be notified immediately to the Parties to this Agreement and to the Joint Committee.  They shall be restricted with regard to their extent and to their duration to what is strictly necessary in order to rectify the situation 
giving rise to their application and shall not be in excess of the injury caused by the practice or the difficulty in question.  Priority shall be given to such measures that will least disturb the functioning of this Agreement. The measures taken by the Palestinian Authority against an action or an omission of an EFTA State may only affect the trade with that State.

5. The safeguard measures taken shall be the object of regular consultations within the Joint Committee with a view to their relaxation, substitution or abolition, when conditions no longer justify their maintenance. 


6. Where exceptional circumstances requiring immediate action make prior examination impossible, the Party concerned may, in the cases of Articles 18 (Dumping), 19 (Emergency action on imports of particular products) and 21 (Re-export and serious shortage) and in cases of state aid having a direct and immediate incidence on trade between the Parties, apply forthwith the precautionary and provisional measures strictly necessary to remedy the situation.
