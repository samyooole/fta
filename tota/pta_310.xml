      <article article_identifier="22327">".... to state, for the informationof the CONTRACTING 


PARTIES to the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, that 


a Customs Union (Interim) Agreement was concluded. between 


the Government of the Union of South Africa and the Govern

ment of Southern Rhodesia on 6th December, 1948. 
"2. Forty copies of the Agreement are being forwarded by


surface mail for distribution amongst the contracting parties. 
"3. In terms of Article 28 thereof, the two Governments 


have decided that the Agreement shall onnter into force on 


1st April, 1949 
"4. In order to enable the contracting parties to ap

preciate more readily the circumastances which have given rise 


to the conclusion of the Customs Unien (Interim) Agreement,


I append a brief explanation of the basis on which the trade 


relations beteen the Union of South Africa and Southern 


Rhodesia have havehithertobeen regulated. 
"5. prior to 1930 there existed a customs union between 


the two countries. This position had obtained since before 


the formation of the Union of South Africa in 1910 and 


during all these years the two countries had a common tariff 
and, subject to a few exceptions, a free interchange of 


domestic products. These principles were embodied in the 


Customs Union Conventions of 1906, 1910 and the subsequent


revisions thereof. 


"6. The first important departure from the parinciple of 
free trade was contained in the Customs Agreement of 1924 


in terms whereof the importation into either country of 


certain commodities was placed under quota. 
-


"7. In 19.3 the Agreement was revised and whilst the 


principle of a free interchange of products between the Union 


and Southern Rhodesia was still maintained provision was made 


for Southern Rhodesia to institute its own customs tariff. 
"8. The principle of a free interchange of products was 


abandened under the Trade Agrcement of 1935 which provided


for the free interchange between the two countries of only 


a limited number of articles whilst all other goods wore 
made dutiable at preferential rates. 


"9. In 1945 the two Governments, after having reviewed 


the operation of the 1935 Trarde Agreement, came to the con

clusion that it would be to their mutual advantage to restore 
the principle of a free interchange of domestic products 


which had previously characterised their commerical relations. 
"10. Officials of the two Governments immediately 
started exploratory discussions with a view to devising 


practical measures for achieving this object. Towards the 


latter half of 1946 their work had advanced sufficiently to 


enable the two Governnents to commence with the negotia

tions which culminatedin the signature of the Custooms Union 


(Interim) Agreement. These negotiations were frequently-


interrupted as a result of other demands made on the limited 
manpower of the two Governments, and were only completed 


towards the end of 1948 when the Agreement was finally 
signed. 
"Il. The Areement aims at facilitating the removal of all 


customs and other trade barriers between the two countries 


and the re-establishementof a Customs Union, and is the first 


step towards restoring the principle of free-trade. 


"12. In terms of Article XXIV of the General Agreement of 
Tariffs and Trade an intarim agreement of this nature must 


include a definite plan and schedule for the attainment of 


a Customs Union within a reasonable length of tine, In this 


connection the following provisious of the Customs Union 


(Interim) Agreement between the Union of South Africa and 


Southern Rhodesia are pertinent:"(i) The preamble which states that the Agreement aims 


at the ultimate re-establishaient of a Customas 


Union between the two countries. 


'(ii) Article -1(b) which defines the term "Transition 


period" as used. in the Agreement in connection 
with the maintenance of certain temporary restrictions on the trade between the two terri

tories, 
"(iii)Article2 and AnnexureAwhich provide for the 
constitution, composition and functions of a full-


time Southern Afriea Customs Union Council. To 


this body has been entrusted the responsibility of 


supervising the implementation of the aims and pur

poses of the Agreement and to make recommendations 
-to the two Governments. 
"(iv) Articles and 8 in which the two Governments have 


undertaken to study the measures necessary for the 


elimination of all tariffs and regulations re

strictive of the commerce between their respective


territaries and have affirmed their ultimate aim 


to re-establish a customs anion. 


"(v)13 in terns whereef the two Governments


Article


have agreed to work towards the adoption of a 


commen customs tariff. 


"(vi)Article17,18and 19 inwhichtheadoptionof 


a common excise tariff is envisaged".</article>
