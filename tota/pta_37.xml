If, as a result of the reduction or elimination of a customs duty under this Agreement, a textile or apparel good benefiting from preferential treatment under this Agreement is being imported into the territory of a Party in such increased quantities, in absolute terms or relative to the domestic market for that good, and under such conditions as to cause serious damage, or actual threat thereof, to a domestic industry producing a like or directly competitive good, the importing Party may, to the extent and for such time as may be necessary to prevent or remedy such damage and to facilitate adjustment, take emergency action, consisting of an increase in the rate of customs duty on the good to a level not to exceed the lesser of:

directly competitive good.  The duration of such a provisional measure shall not exceed 200 days, during which time an investigation by its competent authorities shall be undertaken.

(a) 	no emergency action against a good may be maintained for a period exceeding two years, except that the period may be extended by up to two years if the competent authorities of the importing Party determine, in conformity with the procedures set out in this Article, that:  


(i) 	the emergency action continues to be necessary to prevent or remedy serious damage and to facilitate adjustment by the domestic industry, and 


(ii) 	there is evidence that the industry is adjusting;  

(b) 	no emergency action against a good may be taken or maintained beyond the period ending ten years after customs duties on that good have been eliminated pursuant to this Agreement;  


(c) 	no emergency action may be taken by an importing Party against any particular good of the exporting Party more than once; and 


(d) 	on termination of the emergency action, the rate of customs duty shall be the rate that would have been in effect but for the emergency action. 

7. The importing Party shall provide to the exporting Party mutually agreed trade liberalizing compensation in the form of concessions having substantially equivalent trade effects or equivalent to the value of the additional customs duties expected to result from the emergency action.  Such concessions shall be limited to textile or apparel goods, unless the Parties otherwise agree. If the Parties are unable to agree on compensation, the exporting Party may take tariff action having trade effects substantially equivalent to the trade effects of the emergency action taken under this Article.  The exporting Party may take such tariff action against any goods of the importing Party.  The exporting Party shall apply the tariff action only for the minimum period necessary to achieve the substantially equivalent trade effects. The importing Party’s obligation to provide trade compensation and the exporting Party’s right to take tariff action shall terminate when the emergency action terminates.   


8. 	(a) Each Party retains its rights and obligations under Article XIX of the GATT 1994 and the Safeguards Agreement, and the Agreement on Textiles and Clothing.

      <article number="ARTICLE 4.2" name="Rules Of Origin And Related Matters" article_identifier="5076">Rules of Origin 


1. This Chapter, including its Annexes, and Chapter Five (Rules of Origin) shall apply with respect to determining whether a textile or apparel good is an originating good.  


2. For greater clarity, the rules of origin set forth in this Agreement shall not apply in determining the country of origin of a textile or apparel good for non-preferential purposes.  
Consultations 


3. On the request of either Party, the Parties shall consult to consider whether the rule of origin applicable to a particular textile or apparel good should be revised to address issues of availability of supply of fibres, yarns, or fabrics in the territories of the Parties. 


4. In the consultations referred to in paragraph 3, each Party shall consider all data presented by the other Party showing substantial production in its territory of the particular good.  The Parties shall consider that substantial production has been shown if a Party demonstrates that its domestic producers are capable of supplying commercial quantities of the good in a timely manner. 


5. The Parties shall endeavour to conclude consultations within 60 days of a request.  An agreement between the Parties resulting from the consultations on revising a rule of origin for a good shall supersede any prior rule of origin for such good when approved by the Parties in accordance with Article 23.3 (Amendments). 
De Minimis 


6. A textile or apparel good that is not an originating good because certain fibres or yarns used in the production of the component of the good that determines the tariff classification of the good do not undergo an applicable change in tariff classification set out in Annex 4-A, shall nonetheless be considered to be an originating good if the total weight of all such fibres or yarns in that 

 component is not more than seven percent of the total weight of that component.4-1 

7. Notwithstanding paragraph 6, a good containing elastomeric yarns in the component of the good that determines the tariff classification of the good shall be considered to be an originating good only if such yarns are wholly formed in the territory of a Party. 
Treatment of Sets 

8. Notwithstanding the textile and apparel specific rules of origin set out in Annex 4-A, textile or apparel goods classifiable as goods put up in sets for retail sale as provided for in General Rule of Interpretation 3 of the Harmonized System shall not be regarded as originating goods unless each of the goods in the set is an originating good or the total value of the non-originating goods in the set does not exceed ten percent of the customs value of the set.</article>

2. On the request of the importing Party, the exporting Party shall conduct a verification for purposes of enabling the importing Party to determine that a claim of origin for a textile or apparel good is accurate.  The exporting Party shall conduct such a verification, regardless of whether an importer claims preferential treatment for the good.  The exporting Party may also conduct such a verification on its own initiative. 


3. Where the importing Party has a reasonable suspicion that an exporter or producer of the exporting Party is engaging in unlawful activity relating to trade in textile or apparel goods, the exporting Party shall, on the request of the importing Party, conduct a verification for purposes of enabling the importing Party to determine that the exporter or producer is complying with applicable customs measures affecting trade in textile or apparel goods, including measures that the exporting Party adopts and maintains pursuant to this Agreement and measures of either Party implementing other international agreements affecting trade in textile or 
4-1For greater certainty, when the good is a fibre, yarn, or fabric, the “component of the good that determines the tariff classification of the good” is all of the fibres in the yarn, fabric, or group of fibres 

apparel goods, and to determine that a claim of origin for a textile or apparel good exported or produced by that person is accurate.  For the purposes of this paragraph, a reasonable suspicion of unlawful activity shall be based on relevant factual information of the type set forth in Article 

6.5 (Cooperation) or factors that indicate:  


(a) 	circumvention by the exporter or producer of applicable customs measures affecting trade in textile or apparel goods, including measures adopted to implement this Agreement; or 


(b) 	the existence of conduct that would facilitate the violation of measures relating to other international agreements affecting trade in textile or apparel goods. 

4. The exporting Party, through its competent authorities, shall permit the importing Party, through its competent authorities, to assist in a verification conducted in response to a request under paragraph 2 or 3, including by conducting, along with the competent authorities of the exporting Party, visits in the territory of the exporting Party to the premises of an exporter, producer, or any person involved in the movement of a textile or apparel good from the territory of the exporting Party to the territory of the importing Party.  If an exporter, producer, or other person refuses to consent to a visit by the competent authorities of the importing Party, and if the importing Party is unable to make the determination described in paragraph 2 or 3 within 12 months after its request for a verification, the importing Party may take appropriate action as described in paragraph 8. 


5. In conducting a verification pursuant to paragraph 2 or 3, the exporting Party shall coordinate its activities with the importing Party and shall conclude the verification and report the results to the importing Party within a mutually agreed time.  The report shall include all documents and facts supporting any conclusion that the exporting Party reaches.  If the Parties cannot agree on a time for concluding the verification and providing a report or if the exporting Party does not conclude the verification and report the results to the importing Party within the agreed time, the importing Party may take appropriate action under paragraph 8. 


6. Each Party shall provide to the other Party, consistent with its law, production, trade, and transit documents and other information necessary to conduct verifications under paragraphs 2 and 3. Any documents or information exchanged between the Parties in the course of such a verification shall be treated in accordance with Article 22.4.2 (Disclosure of Information). 


7. While a verification is being conducted, the importing Party may, consistent with its law, take appropriate action, which may include suspending the application of preferential treatment, to: 


(a) 	the textile or apparel good for which a claim of origin has been made, in the case of a verification under paragraph 2; or 


(b) 	any textile or apparel goods exported or produced by the person subject to a verification under paragraph 3, where the reasonable suspicion of unlawful activity relates to those goods. 

8. 	(a) If the importing Party is unable to make the determination described in paragraph 2 within 12 months after its request for a verification, or makes a negative determination, it may, consistent with its laws, regulations, and procedures, take appropriate action, including denying preferential treatment to the textile or apparel good subject to the verification and to similar goods exported or produced by the person that exported or produced the good. 

(b) 	If the importing Party is unable to make one of the determinations described in paragraph 3 within 12 months after its request for a verification, or makes a negative determination, it may, consistent with its laws, regulations, and procedures, take appropriate action, including deny preferential treatment to any textile or apparel good exported or produced by the person subject to the verification. 

9. 	(a) The importing Party may deny preferential treatment or entry under paragraph 8 only after providing a written determination to the importer of the reason for the denial. 

(b) 	If the importing Party takes action under paragraph 8 because it is unable to make the determination described in paragraph 2 or 3, as the case may be, it may continue to take appropriate action under paragraph 8 until it receives information sufficient to enable it to make that determination. 

10. On the request of either Party, the Parties shall consult to resolve any technical or interpretive difficulties that may arise under this Article or to discuss ways to improve the effectiveness of their cooperative efforts.  In addition, either Party may request technical or other assistance from the other Party in implementing this Article.

Except for goods covered by paragraph 2, where Annex 5-A refers to a regional value content, each Party shall provide that for purposes of claims for preferential treatment in accordance with Article 5.12, an importer, exporter, or producer may calculate regional value content based on one of the following methods: 

(a) 	Build-down Method 

RVC = AV - VNM x 100 
AV 


where 

RVC 	is the regional value content, expressed as a percentage; 

AV 	is the adjusted value; and 

VNM 	is the value of non-originating materials that are acquired and used by the producer in the production of the good. VNM does not include the value of a material that is self-produced. 

(b) 	Build-up Method 

RVC = 	VOM x 100 
AV 


where 

RVC 	is the regional value content, expressed as a percentage; 

AV 	is the adjusted value; and 

VOM is the value of originating materials that are acquired or self-produced, and used by the producer in the production of the good. 

2. When regional value content is required for certain automotive goods5-2 under Annex 5-A to determine if a good is originating, each Party shall provide that the regional value content of a good shall be calculated solely on the basis of the following method: 

5-2HS 8407.31 through 34 (engines), 8407.20 (diesel engines for vehicles), 84.09 (parts of engines) 87.01 through 

87.05 (motor vehicles), 87.06 (chassis), 87.07 (bodies), and 87.08 (motor vehicle parts).

the same model line of motor vehicles in the same class of vehicles produced in the same plant in the territory of a Party; 
(b) 

the same class of motor vehicles produced in the same plant in the territory of a Party; or

the same model line of motor vehicles produced in the territory of a Party, 
on the basis of all motor vehicles in the category or only those motor vehicles in the category that are exported to the territory of the other Party. 

4. Each Party shall provide that, for the purpose of calculating regional value content under paragraph 2 for automotive materials5-4 produced in the same plant, the importer, exporter, or producer may use a calculation:

To this end, each Party shall ensure that its regulatory body does not hold a financial interest in any supplier of public telecommunications services, and that any financial interest that the Party holds in a supplier of a public telecommunications services does not influence the decisions and procedures of its telecommunications regulatory body. 


3. Where a Party has an ownership interest in a supplier of a public telecommunications service and it intends to reduce or eliminate that interest, it shall notify the other Party as soon as feasible.</article>

2. Each Party shall make publicly available the current state of allocated frequency bands but shall not be required to provide detailed identification of frequencies assigned for specific government uses.  


3. For greater clarity, measures regarding the allocation and assignment of spectrum and regarding frequency management are not measures that are per se inconsistent with Article 10.4 (Market Access), which is applied to Chapter Eleven (Investment) through Article 10.1.3 (Scope and Coverage).  Accordingly, each Party retains the right to establish and apply its spectrum and frequency management policies, which may limit the number of suppliers of public telecommunications services, provided that it does so in a manner that is consistent with this Agreement.  Each Party also retains the right to allocate frequency bands taking into account current and future needs. 


4. When making a spectrum allocation for non-government telecommunications services, each Party shall endeavour to rely on an open and transparent public comment process that considers the overall public interest.  Each Party shall endeavour to rely generally on market-based approaches in assigning spectrum for terrestrial non-government telecommunications services.</article>

2. Such authority shall include the ability to impose, or seek from administrative or judicial bodies, effective sanctions, which may include financial penalties, injunctive relief (on an interim or final basis), or the modification, suspension, and revocation of licenses. 

12-7For greater clarity, telecommunications resources do not include spectrum allocated and used for the broadcast of radio and television programming. 12-8For the purpose of Australia’s obligations under this Chapter, notwithstanding this paragraph, a supplier of public 

telecommunications services may be required to apply to a judicial body for the enforcement of a determination by a regulatory body in relation to the resolution of a dispute under a domestic measure relating to the obligations in Article 12.11.</article>

12.9 through 12.14; 

(b) 	suppliers of public telecommunications of the other Party that have requested interconnection with a major supplier in the Party’s territory will have recourse to a telecommunications regulatory body:12-9

To this end, each Party may forebear from applying a regulation or other measure, to the extent provided for in the Party’s law, to a service that the Party classifies as a public telecommunications service if its telecommunications regulatory body determines that: 


(a) 	enforcement of such regulation is not necessary to prevent unreasonable or discriminatory practices; 


(b) 	enforcement of such regulation is not necessary for the protection of consumers; and 
12-9 In the United States, this body may be a state regulatory authority.   
12-10For the purposes of this Agreement, the extent to which the United States telecommunications regulatory body 
may forbear is governed by section 10 of the U.S. Communications Act of 1934, as amended by the 
Telecommunications Act of 1996. 


(c) 	forbearance is consistent with the public interest, including promoting and enhancing competition among suppliers of public telecommunications services. 


2. Each Party shall provide interested persons of the other Party adequate public notice and opportunity to comment before the Party’s telecommunication regulatory body makes any decision regarding forbearance.

3. dialing parity means the ability of an end-user to use an equal number of digits to access a like public telecommunications service, regardless of the public telecommunications service supplier chosen by such end-user and in a way that involves no unreasonable dialing delays; 


4. end-user means a final consumer of or subscriber to a public telecommunications service, including a service supplier other than a supplier of public telecommunications services; 


5. essential facilities means facilities of a public telecommunications network or service that:

communicate with the users of another supplier and to access services provided by another supplier;

15. telecommunications regulatory body means a central level body responsible for the regulation of telecommunications; 


16. user means an end-user or a supplier of public telecommunications services; and

This does not prejudice either Party’s position in the WTO on the scope and definition of these services.  

17. value-added services means services that add value to telecommunications services through enhanced functionality.  More specifically, with respect to the obligations of the United States under this Chapter, these are services as defined in 47 USC § 153(20), and with respect to the obligations of Australia under this Chapter, value-added services are telecommunications services for which suppliers “add value” to customer information by enhancing its form or content or by providing for its storage and retrieval.</article>

Each Party shall maintain or adopt measures to proscribe anticompetitive business conduct and take appropriate action with respect thereto, recognizing that such measures will help realise the objectives of this Agreement.  To this end, the Parties shall consult from time to time about the effectiveness of measures that a Party has undertaken.  Each Party shall ensure that a person subject to the imposition of a sanction or remedy for violation of such measures is provided with the opportunity to be heard and to present evidence, and to seek review of such sanction or remedy in a court or independent tribunal of that Party. 


2. Each Party shall maintain an authority or authorities responsible for the enforcement of its national competition laws.  The enforcement policy of each Party’s central government authorities responsible for the enforcement of such laws includes treating non-nationals no less favourably than nationals in like circumstances, and each Party’s authorities intend to maintain this policy, in that regard. 


3. The Parties recognize the importance of cooperation and coordination between their respective authorities to further effective competition law enforcement in the free trade area.  The Parties shall cooperate in relation to the enforcement of competition laws and policy, including through mutual assistance, notification, consultation, and exchange of information. 


(a) 	The Parties recognize their existing mechanisms for cooperation in relation to competition law enforcement, specifically: 


(i) 	The Agreement between the Government of Australia and the Government of the United States of America relating to Cooperation on Antitrust Matters of 1982; and 


(ii) 	The Agreement between the Government of Australia and the Government of the United States of America on Mutual Antitrust Enforcement Assistance of 1999.

competition laws, where feasible and appropriate, of a request by the other Party’s central government authorities responsible for the enforcement of its competition laws to initiate or expand enforcement activities. 

4. To further advance their cooperation, the Parties shall examine the scope for strengthening support for, and minimizing legal impediments to, the effective enforcement of each other’s competition laws and policies.  The Parties shall establish a joint working group with the goal of seeking to reach a common view, by the first meeting of the Joint Committee established pursuant to Chapter 21 (Institutional Arrangements and Dispute Settlement), of appropriate steps to enhance their respective legal and regulatory regimes in that regard.</article>

Recognizing that designated monopolies should not operate in a manner that creates obstacles to trade and investment, each Party shall ensure that any privately-owned monopoly that it designates after the date of entry into force of this Agreement and any government monopoly that it designates or has designated: 


(a) 	acts in a manner that is not inconsistent with the Party’s obligations under this Agreement wherever such a monopoly exercises any regulatory, administrative, or other governmental authority that the Party has delegated to it in connection with the monopoly good or service, such as the power to grant import or export licenses, approve commercial transactions, or impose quotas, fees, or other charges; 


(b) 	acts solely in accordance with commercial considerations in its purchase or sale of the monopoly good or service in the relevant market, including with regard to price, quality, availability, marketability, transportation, and other terms and conditions of purchase or sale, except to comply with any terms of its designation that are not inconsistent with subparagraph (c) or (d); 


(c) 	provides non-discriminatory treatment to covered investments, to goods of the other Party, and to service suppliers of the other Party in its purchase or sale of the monopoly good or service in the relevant market; and 


(d) 	does not use its monopoly position to engage, either directly or indirectly, including through its dealings with its parent, subsidiaries, or other enterprises with common ownership, in anticompetitive practices in a non-monopolized market in its territory, where such practices adversely affect covered investments.

(b) 	accords non-discriminatory treatment in the sale of its goods or services. 

2. The United States shall ensure that anticompetitive activities by sub-federal state enterprises are not excluded from the reach of its national antitrust laws solely by reason of their status as sub-federal state enterprises, to the extent that their activities are not protected by the State Action Doctrine. 


3. Australia shall take reasonable measures, including through its policy of competitive neutrality, to ensure that its governments at all levels do not provide any competitive advantage to any government businesses simply because they are government-owned.  This paragraph applies to the business activities of government businesses and not to their non-business, noncommercial activities.  Australia shall ensure that its competitive neutrality complaints offices treat complaints lodged by the United States, or persons of the United States, no less favourably than complaints lodged by persons or government bodies of Australia.</article>

(i) 	cooperating in the prompt detection of consumer protection law violations affecting consumers or markets in both Parties’ territories, 

(ii) 	notifying each other of significant investigations and proceedings involving consumer protection law violations occurring or originating in the territory of the other Party or significantly affecting consumers or markets in the territory of the other Party, 

(iii) 	exchanging information related to the administration of their consumer protection laws, 


(iv) 	providing enforcement and investigative assistance to each other to the extent compatible with each Party’s laws, in appropriate consumer protection law cases, and 


(v) 	consulting and coordinating on enforcement actions against consumer protection law violations that have a significant cross-border dimension;

4. Nothing in this Article shall limit the discretion of the FTC or ACCC to decide whether to take action on particular requests by the other agency, or shall preclude either agency from taking action with respect to particular cases. 


5. In addition, the Parties shall identify, in areas of mutual concern and consistent with their important interests, obstacles to effective cross-border cooperation in the enforcement of consumer protection laws, and shall consider changing their domestic frameworks to overcome 
such obstacles and enhance the ability of the Parties to cooperate, share information, and assist in the enforcement of each other’s consumer protection laws, including, if appropriate, adopting or amending national legislation to overcome such obstacles.</article>
      <article number="ARTICLE 14.7" name="Recognition And Enforcement Of Monetary Judgments" article_identifier="5211">1. The Parties recognize the importance of civil proceedings by the FTC, U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission, Australian Securities and Investments Commission, and the ACCC to provide monetary restitution to consumers, investors, or customers who have suffered economic harm as a result of being deceived, defrauded, or misled.  The Parties further recognize the importance of facilitating cross-border recognition and enforcement of monetary judgments obtained for such purposes. 


2. When an agency listed in paragraph 1 obtains a civil monetary judgment from a judicial authority of a Party for the purpose of providing monetary restitution to consumers, investors, or customers who have suffered economic harm as a result of being deceived, defrauded, or misled, a judicial authority of the other Party generally should not disqualify such a monetary judgment from recognition or enforcement on the ground that it is penal or revenue in nature or based on other foreign public law, including where such judgment contains provisions for recovery of monies or other disposition in the event that restitution is impractical or for payment of expenses related to the collection or distribution of such a monetary judgment. 


3. The judicial authorities of a Party should consider the recognition or enforcement of provisions for monetary judgments described in paragraph 2 separately from other provisions of the judgment, to the extent such other provisions are deemed to be penal or revenue in nature or based on other foreign public law for the purposes of recognition or enforcement. 


4. Nothing in this Article is intended to affect whether any other category of law or judgment is appropriately viewed as penal or revenue in nature or based on other foreign public law for the purposes of the recognition or enforcement of foreign judgments. 


5. Each Party’s agencies listed in paragraph 1 should cooperate with the relevant agencies of the other Party, where feasible and appropriate, in facilitating the identification of consumers, investors, and customers described in paragraph 2 and on other matters relating to payment of monetary judgments.

(c) 	exemptions and immunities to its measures proscribing anticompetitive business conduct, provided that requests shall specify the particular goods and markets of concern and include indicia that the exemptions and immunities may hinder trade or investment between the Parties.</article>

Valuation 

6. In estimating the value of a procurement for the purpose of ascertaining whether it is a covered procurement, a procuring entity shall:

6. A procuring entity shall require all participating suppliers to submit tenders in accordance with a common deadline.  For greater certainty, this requirement also applies where:

Technical Specifications 


3. A procuring entity may not prepare, adopt, or apply any technical specification or prescribe any conformity assessment procedure with the purpose or the effect of creating unnecessary obstacles to trade between the Parties. 


4. In prescribing the technical specifications for the good or service being procured, a procuring entity shall: 


(a) 	specify the technical specifications, wherever appropriate, in terms of performance and functional requirements, rather than design or descriptive characteristics; and 


(b) 	base the technical specifications on international standards, where such exist and are applicable to the procuring entity, except where the use of an international standard would fail to meet the procuring entity’s program requirements or would impose greater burdens than the use of a recognized national standard.  

5. A procuring entity may not prescribe technical specifications that require or refer to a particular trademark or trade name, patent, copyright, design or type, specific origin, producer, or supplier, unless there is no other sufficiently precise or intelligible way of describing the procurement requirements and provided that, in such cases, words such as “or equivalent” are included in the tender documentation. 


6. A procuring entity may not seek or accept, in a manner that would have the effect of precluding competition, advice that may be used in the preparation or adoption of any technical 

specification for a specific procurement from a person that may have a commercial interest in the procurement. 

7. 	Notwithstanding paragraph 6, a procuring entity may: 


(a) 	conduct market research in developing specifications for a particular procurement; or 


(b) 	allow a supplier that has been engaged to provide design or consulting services to participate in procurements related to such services, provided it would not give the supplier an unfair advantage over other suppliers.

With respect to secondary uses of phonograms by means of analogue communications and free over-the-air radio broadcasting, however, a Party may limit the rights of the performers and producers of the other Party to the rights its persons are accorded in the territory of the other Party. 


7. A Party may derogate from paragraph 6 in relation to its judicial and administrative procedures, including requiring a national of the other Party to designate an address for service of process in its territory, or to appoint an agent in its territory, provided that such derogation is: 


(a) 	necessary to secure compliance with laws and regulations that are not inconsistent with this Chapter; and 


(b) 	not applied in a manner that would constitute a disguised restriction on trade. 

8. Paragraph 6 does not apply to procedures provided in multilateral agreements concluded under the auspices of World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO) in relation to the acquisition or maintenance of intellectual property rights. 
Application of Agreement to Existing Subject Matter  


9. Except as it provides otherwise, including Article 17.4.5, this Chapter gives rise to obligations in respect of all subject matter existing at the date of entry into force of this Agreement, that is protected on that date in the territory of the Party where protection is claimed, or that meets or comes subsequently to meet the criteria for protection under this Chapter. 


10. Except as otherwise provided in this Chapter, including Article 17.4.5, a Party shall not be required to restore protection to subject matter that on the date of entry into force of this Agreement has fallen into the public domain in the territory of the Party where the protection is claimed. 
17-1For the purposes of Articles 17.1.6, 17.1.7, 17.2.12(b), and 17.6.1, a national of a Party also means, in respect of the relevant right, an entity of that Party that would meet the criteria for eligibility for protection provided for in the agreements listed in Articles 17.1.2 and 17.1.4, and the TRIPS Agreement 17-2For the purposes of this paragraph, protection includes matters affecting the availability, acquisition, scope, maintenance, and enforcement of intellectual property rights, as well as those matters affecting the use of intellectual property rights specifically covered by this Chapter.

Each Party shall provide that marks17-4 shall include marks in respect of goods and services, collective marks, and certification marks.  Each Party shall also provide that geographical indications are eligible for protection as marks.17-5 


2. Neither Party may require, as a condition of registration, that marks be visually perceptible, nor may a Party deny registration of a mark solely on the ground that the sign of which it is composed is a sound or a scent.17-6 


3. Each Party shall ensure that its measures mandating the use of the term customary in common language as the common name for a good or service (“common name”) including, inter alia, requirements concerning the relative size, placement, or style of use of the mark in relation to the common name, do not impair the use or effectiveness of marks used in relation to such goods or services. 


4. Each Party shall provide that the owner of a registered mark shall have the exclusive right to prevent all third parties not having the owner’s consent from using in the course of trade identical or similar signs, including geographical indications, for goods or services that are related to those goods or services in respect of which the owner’s mark is registered, where such 
17-3A Party may satisfy the requirement for publication by making the law, regulation, or procedure available to the public on the Internet. 17-4For the purposes of this Article, in respect of the law of Australia, marks means “trademarks”. 17-5A geographical indication shall be capable of constituting a mark to the extent that the geographical indication consists of any sign, or any combination of signs (such as words, including geographic and personal names, as well as letters, numerals, figurative elements and colours, including single colours), capable of identifying a good as originating in the territory of a Party, or a region or locality in that territory, where a given quality, reputation, or other characteristic of the good  is essentially attributable to its geographical origin.  For the purposes of this Chapter, originating does not have the meaning ascribed to that term in Article 1.2 (General Definitions).  17-6A Party may require an adequate description, which can be represented graphically, of the mark. 

use would result in a likelihood of confusion.  In case of the use of an identical sign, including a geographical indication, for identical goods or services, a likelihood of confusion shall be presumed. 


5. Each Party may provide limited exceptions to the rights conferred by a mark, such as fair use of descriptive terms, provided that such exceptions take account of the legitimate interest of the owner of the mark and of third parties. 


6. Article 6bis of the Paris Convention shall apply, mutatis mutandis, to goods or services that are not identical or similar to those identified by a well-known mark,17-7 whether registered or not, provided that use of that mark in relation to those goods or services would indicate a connection between those goods or services and the owner of the mark, and provided that the interests of the owner of the mark are likely to be damaged by such use. 


7. Recognising the importance of registration systems for marks that provide rights of presumptive validity, through the conduct of examination as to substance as well as to formalities, and through opposition and cancellation procedures, each Party shall provide a system for the registration of marks, which shall include: 


(a) 	providing to the applicant a communication in writing, which may be electronic, of the reasons for any refusal to register a mark; 


(b) 	an opportunity for the applicant to respond to communications from the authorities responsible for registration of marks, to contest an initial refusal, and to appeal judicially any final refusal to register;  


(c) 	an opportunity for interested parties to oppose the registration of a mark or to seek cancellation of a mark after it has been registered; and 


(d) 	a requirement that decisions in opposition or cancellation proceedings be reasoned and in writing. 

8. 	Each Party shall provide: 


(a) 	a system for the electronic application, processing, registration, and maintenance of marks; and 


(b) 	a publicly available electronic database, including an on-line database, of applications for marks and registrations. 

9. Each Party shall provide that initial registration and each renewal of registration of a mark shall be for a term of no less than ten years. 


10. 	Neither Party may require recordal of licences for marks.  


11. Each Party shall endeavour to reduce differences in law and practice between the Parties’ respective systems for the protection of marks, including differences that affect the cost to users.  In addition, each Party shall endeavour to participate in international trademark harmonisation efforts, including the WIPO fora dealing with reform and development of the international trademark system. 


12. 	(a) Each Party shall provide a system that permits owners to assert rights in marks, and interested parties to challenge rights in marks, through administrative or judicial means, or both. 
17-7 In determining whether a mark is well known, the reputation of the mark need not extend beyond the sector of the public that normally deals with the relevant goods or services. 

(b) 	Consistent with sub-paragraph (a), where a Party provides the means to apply for protection or petition for recognition of geographical indications, through a system for the protection of marks or otherwise, it shall accept such applications and petitions without the requirement for intercession by a Party on behalf of its nationals, and shall: 


(i) 	process applications or petitions, as relevant, for geographical indications with a minimum of formalities; 


(ii) 	make its regulations governing filing of such applications or petitions, as relevant, readily available to the public; 
(iii) 	ensure that applications or petitions, as relevant, for geographical indications are published for opposition, and provide procedures for opposing geographical indications that are the subject of applications or petitions. Each Party shall also provide procedures to cancel any registration resulting from an application or a petition; 


(iv) 	ensure that measures governing the filing of applications or petitions, as relevant, for geographical indications set out clearly the procedures for these actions.  These procedures shall include contact information sufficient for applicants or petitioners, as relevant, to obtain specific procedural guidance regarding the processing of those applications or petitions; and 


(v) 	provide that grounds for refusing an application for protection or recognition of a geographical indication include the following:  


(A) 	the geographical indication is likely to cause confusion with a mark that is the subject of a good-faith pending application or registration; and 


(B) 	the geographical indication is likely to cause confusion with a preexisting mark, the rights to which have been acquired through use in good faith in the territory of the Party.</article>

Likewise, each Party shall provide that in cases where authorisation is needed from both the author of a work embodied in a phonogram and a performer or producer owning rights in the phonogram, the need for the authorisation of the performer or producer does not cease to exist because the authorisation of the author is also required. 

4. Each Party shall provide that, where the term of protection of a work (including a photographic work), performance, or phonogram is to be calculated: 


(a) 	on the basis of the life of a natural person, the term shall be not less than the life of the author and 70 years after the author’s death; and

(ii) 	failing such authorised publication within 50 years from the creation of the work, performance, or phonogram, not less than 70 years from the end of the calendar year of the creation of the work, performance, or phonogram. 

5. Each Party shall apply Article 18 of the Berne Convention and Article 14.6 of the TRIPS Agreement, mutatis mutandis, to the subject matter, rights, and obligations in this Article and Articles 17.5 and 17.6.

(a) In order to provide adequate legal protection and effective legal remedies against the circumvention of effective technological measures that authors, performers, and producers of phonograms use in connection with the exercise of their rights and that restrict unauthorised acts in respect of their works, performances, and phonograms, each Party shall provide that any person who: 


(i) 	knowingly, or having reasonable grounds to know, circumvents without authority any effective technological measure that controls access to a protected work, performance, or phonogram, or other subject matter; or  


(ii) 	manufactures, imports, distributes, offers to the public, provides, or otherwise traffics in devices, products, or components, or offers to the public, or provides services that:

(i) 	non-infringing reverse engineering activities with regard to a lawfully obtained copy of a computer program, carried out in good faith with respect to particular elements of that computer program that have not been readily available to the person 

engaged in those activities, for the sole purpose of achieving interoperability of an independently created computer program with other programs; 

(ii) 	non-infringing good faith activities, carried out by an appropriately qualified researcher who has lawfully obtained a copy, unfixed performance, or display of a work, performance, or phonogram and who has made a good faith effort to obtain authorisation for such activities, to the extent necessary for the sole purpose of identifying and analysing flaws and vulnerabilities of technologies for scrambling and descrambling of information;

(f) 	The exceptions to any measures implementing sub-paragraph (a) for the activities set forth in sub-paragraph (e) may only be applied as follows, and only to the extent that they do not impair the adequacy of legal protection or the effectiveness of legal remedies against the circumvention of effective technological measures: 


(i) 	any measures implementing sub-paragraph (a)(i) may be subject to exceptions with respect to each activity set forth in sub-paragraph (e); 


(ii) 	any measures implementing sub-paragraph (a)(ii), as they apply to effective technological measures that control access to a work, performance, or phonogram, may be subject to exceptions with respect to activities set forth in sub-paragraph (e)(i), (ii), (iii), (iv), and (vi); and 
(iii) 	any measures implementing sub-paragraph (a)(ii), as they apply to effective technological measures that protect any copyright, may be subject to exceptions with respect to the activities set forth in subparagraph (e)(i) and (vi).

(i) 	knowingly removes or alters any rights management information; 


(ii) 	distributes or imports for distribution rights management information knowing that the rights management information has been removed or altered without authority; or 
(iii) 	distributes to the public, imports for distribution, broadcasts, communicates, or makes available to the public copies of works, performances, or phonograms, knowing that rights management information has been removed or altered without authority,

(iii) 	any electronic numbers or codes that represent such information, 

when any of these items is attached to a copy of the work, performance, or phonogram or appears in connection with the communication or making available of a work, performance, or phonogram to the public. Nothing in this paragraph shall obligate a Party to require the owner of any right in the work, performance, or phonogram to attach rights management information to copies of the work, performance, or phonogram, or to cause rights management information to appear in connection with a communication of the work, performance, or phonogram to the public. 


9. Each Party shall provide appropriate laws, orders, regulations, government issued guidelines, or administrative or executive decrees providing that its central government agencies not use infringing computer software and only use computer software as authorised in the relevant licence.  These measures shall provide for the regulation of the acquisition and management of software for such government use and may take the form of procedures such as those under which an agency prepares and maintains inventories of software present on the agency’s computers and inventories of software licenses. 


10. 	With respect to Articles 17.4, 17.5, and 17.6: 


(a) 	each Party shall confine limitations or exceptions to exclusive rights to certain special cases that do not conflict with a normal exploitation of the work, performance, or phonogram, and do not unreasonably prejudice the legitimate interests of the right holder;

For the purposes of this paragraph, any delays that occur in the issuance of a patent due to periods attributable to actions of the patent applicant or any opposing third person need not be included in the determination of such delay. 

(b) 	With respect to a pharmaceutical product17-17 that is subject to a patent, each Party shall make available an adjustment of the patent term to compensate the patent owner for unreasonable curtailment of the effective patent term as a result of the marketing approval process. 


9. Each Party shall disregard information contained in public disclosures used to determine if an invention is novel or has an inventive step if the public disclosure, (a) was made or authorised by, or derived from, the patent applicant and (b) occurs within 12 months prior to the date of filing of the application in the territory of the Party. 


10. Each Party shall provide patent applicants with at least one opportunity to make amendments, corrections, and observations in connection with their applications. 


11. Each Party shall provide that a disclosure of a claimed invention shall be considered to be sufficiently clear and complete if it provides information that allows the invention to be made and used by a person skilled in the art, without undue experimentation, as of the filing date. 


12. Each Party shall provide that a claimed invention is sufficiently supported by its disclosure if the disclosure reasonably conveys to a person skilled in the art that the applicant was in possession of the claimed invention, as of the filing date. 


13. Each Party shall provide that a claimed invention is useful if it has a specific, substantial, and credible utility. 


14. Each Party shall endeavour to reduce differences in law and practice between their respective systems, including in respect of differences in determining the rights to an invention, the prior art effect of applications for patents, and the division of an application containing multiple inventions.  In addition, each Party shall endeavour to participate in international patent harmonisation efforts, including the WIPO fora addressing reform and development of the international patent system. 
17-17For Australia, the term pharmaceutical substance as used in Section 70 of the Patents Act 1990 on the date of entry into force of this Agreement may be treated as synonymous with the term pharmaceutical product as used in this sub-paragraph. 

15. Each Party shall endeavour to establish a cooperative framework between their respective patent offices as a basis for progress towards the mutual exploitation of search and examination work.</article>

(a) 

If a Party requires, as a condition of approving the marketing of a new 




pharmaceutical product, the submission of undisclosed test or other data 




concerning safety or efficacy of the product, the Party shall not permit third 




persons, without the consent of the person who provided the information, to 




market the same or a similar product on the basis of that information, or the 




marketing approval granted to the person who submitted such information, for at 




least five years from the date of marketing approval by the Party.  


(b) 

If a Party requires, as a condition of approving the marketing of a new agricultural 




chemical product, including certain new uses of the same product, the submission 




of undisclosed test or other data concerning safety or efficacy of that product, the 




Party shall not permit third persons, without the consent of the person who 




provided the information, to market the same or a similar product on the basis of 




that information, or the marketing approval granted to the person who submitted 




such information, for ten years from the date of the marketing approval of the new 




agricultural chemical product by the Party.   


(c)

pharmaceutical or agricultural chemical product, third persons to submit evidence 




concerning the safety or efficacy of a product that was previously approved in 




another territory, such as evidence of prior marketing approval, the Party shall not 




permit third persons, without the consent of the person who previously submitted 




information concerning safety or efficacy, to market the same or a similar product 




on the basis of evidence of prior marketing approval in another territory, or 




information concerning safety or efficacy that was previously submitted to obtain 




marketing approval in another territory, for at least five years, and ten years for 




agricultural chemical products, from the date of marketing approval by the Party, or the other territory, whichever is late.17-18 


(d) 

For the purposes of this Article, a new product is one that does not contain a 




chemical entity that has been previously approved for marketing in the Party. 


(e) 

If any undisclosed information concerning the safety or efficacy of a product

the purposes of obtaining marketing approval is disclosed by a government entity, or entity acting on behalf of a government, each Party is required to protect such information from unfair commercial use in the manner set forth in this Article. 


2. With respect to pharmaceutical products, if a Party requires the submission of:  (a) new clinical information (other than information related to bioequivalency) or (b) evidence of prior approval of the product in another territory that requires such new information, which is essential to the approval of a pharmaceutical product, the Party shall not permit third persons not having the consent of the person providing the information to market the same or a similar pharmaceutical product on the basis of the marketing approval granted to a person submitting the information for a period of at least three years from the date of the marketing approval by the Party or the other territory, whichever is later.17-19  


3. When a product is subject to a system of marketing approval in accordance with paragraph 1 or 2, as applicable, and is also subject to a patent in the territory of that Party, the Party shall not alter the term of protection that it provides pursuant to paragraph 1 or 2 in the event that the patent protection terminates on a date earlier than the end of the term of protection specified in paragraph 1 or 2, as applicable. 


4. Where a Party permits, as a condition of approving the marketing of a pharmaceutical product, persons, other than the person originally submitting the safety or efficacy information, to rely on evidence or information concerning the safety or efficacy of a product that was previously approved, such as evidence of prior marketing approval by the Party or in another territory:  
(a) 	that Party shall provide measures in its marketing approval process to prevent those other persons from: 


(i) 	marketing a product, where that product is claimed in a patent; or 


(ii) 	marketing a product for an approved use, where that approved use is claimed in a patent, 
during the term of that patent, unless by consent or acquiescence of the patent owner; and 

(b) 	if the Party permits a third person to request marketing approval to enter the market with: 

(i) 	a product during the term of a patent identified as claiming the product; or 

17-19As an alternative to this paragraph, where a Party, on the date of entry into force of this Agreement, has in place a system for protecting information submitted in connection with the approval of a pharmaceutical product that utilizes a previously approved chemical component from unfair commercial use, the Party may retain that system, notwithstanding the obligations of this paragraph. 

(ii) 	a product for an approved use, during the term of a patent identified as claiming that approved use, 

the Party shall provide for the patent owner to be notified of such request and the identity of any such other person.</article>

Each Party shall provide that such decisions or rulings shall be published17-20 or, where such publication is not practicable, otherwise made available to the public, in a national language in such a manner as to enable governments and right holders to become acquainted with them. 


3. Each Party shall inform the public of its efforts to provide effective enforcement of intellectual property rights in its civil, administrative, and criminal system, including any statistical information that the Party may collect for such purpose. 


4. In civil, criminal, and if applicable, administrative procedures, involving copyright, each Party shall provide for a presumption that, in the absence of evidence to the contrary, the person whose name is indicated in the usual manner is the right holder in the work, performance, or phonogram as designated.

(c) 	in regard to counterfeit trademarked goods, the simple removal of the trademark unlawfully affixed shall not be sufficient to permit the release of goods into the channels of commerce. 

11. Each Party shall provide that in civil judicial proceedings concerning the enforcement of intellectual property rights, its judicial authorities shall have the authority to order the infringer to provide any information that the infringer possesses regarding any person involved in any aspect of the infringement and regarding the means of production or distribution channel of the infringing material, and to provide this information to the right holder’s representative in the proceedings.17-24 


12. Each Party shall provide that in judicial proceedings concerning the enforcement of intellectual property rights, its judicial authorities shall have the authority to: 


(a) 	fine or imprison, in appropriate cases, a party to litigation who fails to abide by valid orders issued by such authorities; and

14. Each Party shall provide that its judicial authorities shall have the authority to enjoin a party to a civil judicial proceeding from the exportation of goods that are alleged to infringe an intellectual property right. 


15. If a Party’s judicial or other authorities appoint technical or other experts in civil judicial proceedings concerning the enforcement of intellectual property rights, and require that the parties to litigation or other civil or criminal proceedings bear the costs of such experts, the Party should seek to ensure that these costs are reasonable and related appropriately to, inter alia, the quantity and nature of work to be performed and do not unreasonably deter recourse to such litigation or proceeding. 
Provisional measures 


16. Each Party’s authorities shall act on requests for relief inaudita altera parte expeditiously in accordance with the Party’s judicial rules. 


17. With respect to provisional measures, each Party shall provide that its judicial authorities shall have the authority to require the applicant to provide any reasonably available evidence in order to satisfy themselves with a sufficient degree of certainty that the applicant’s right is being infringed or that such infringement is imminent, and to order the applicant to provide a reasonable security or equivalent assurance set at a level sufficient to protect the respondent and to prevent abuse, and so as not to unreasonably deter recourse to such procedures. 


18. In proceedings concerning the grant of provisional measures in relation to enforcement of a patent, each Party shall provide for a rebuttable presumption that the patent is valid. 
17-25Reasonable attorney’s fees may include those levied pursuant to relevant court fee schedules. 

Special requirements related to border measures 


19. Each Party shall provide that any right holder initiating procedures for that Party’s customs authorities to suspend the release of suspected counterfeit17-26 or confusingly similar trademark goods, or pirated copyright goods,17-27 into free circulation is required to provide adequate evidence to satisfy the competent authorities, administrative or judicial that, under the laws of the territory of importation, there is prima facie an infringement of the right holder's intellectual property right and to supply sufficient information that may reasonably be expected to be within the right holder’s knowledge to make the suspected goods reasonably recognisable by the Party’s customs authorities.  The requirement to provide sufficient information shall not unreasonably deter recourse to these procedures.  Each Party shall provide that the application to suspend the release of goods shall remain in force for a period of not less than one year from the date of application or the period that the good is protected by copyright or the relevant trademark is registered, whichever is shorter. 


20. Each Party shall provide that its competent authorities shall have the authority to require a right holder initiating procedures to suspend the release of goods suspected of being counterfeit trademark or pirated copyright goods to provide  

a reasonable security or equivalent assurance sufficient to protect the defendant and the competent authorities and to prevent abuse.  Each Party shall provide that such security or equivalent assurance shall not unreasonably deter recourse to these procedures.  Each Party may provide that such security may be in the form of a documentary guarantee conditioned to hold the importer or owner of the imported merchandise harmless from any loss or damage resulting from any suspension of the release of goods in the event the competent authorities determine that the article is not an infringing good. 

21. Where its competent authorities have made a determination that goods are counterfeit or pirated, a Party shall provide that its competent authorities have the authority to inform the right holder of the names and addresses of the consignor, the importer, and the consignee, and of the quantity of the goods in question. 


22. Each Party shall provide that its customs authorities may initiate border measures ex officio with respect to imported merchandise suspected of infringing being counterfeit trademark or pirated copyright goods, without the need for a specific formal complaint. 
17-26For the purposes of paragraphs 19 through 24, counterfeit trademark goods means any goods, including packaging, bearing without authorisation a trademark that is identical to the trademark validly registered in respect of such goods, or that cannot be distinguished in its essential aspects from such a trademark, and that thereby infringes the rights of the owner of the trademark in question under the law of the country of importation. 17-27For the purposes of paragraphs 19 through 24, pirated copyright goods means any goods that are copies made without the consent of the right holder or person duly authorised by the right holder in the country of production and that are made directly or indirectly from an article where the making of that copy would have constituted an infringement of a copyright or a related right under the law of the country of importation. 


23. Each Party shall provide that goods that have been suspended from release by its customs authorities, and that have been forfeited as pirated or counterfeit, shall be destroyed, except in exceptional cases. In regard to counterfeit trademark goods, the simple removal of the trademark unlawfully affixed shall not be sufficient to permit the release of the goods into the channels of commerce. In no event shall the competent authorities be authorised to permit the exportation of counterfeit or pirated goods that have been seized, nor shall they be authorised to permit such goods to be subject to movement under customs control, except in exceptional circumstances. 


24. Each Party shall provide that where an application fee or merchandise storage fee is assessed in connection with border measures to enforce a trademark or copyright, the fee shall not be set at an amount that unreasonably deters recourse to these measures. 


25. Each shall provide the other, on mutually agreed terms, with technical advice on the enforcement of border measures concerning intellectual property rights, and the Parties shall promote bilateral and regional cooperation on such matters. 
Criminal procedures and remedies 

26. 	(a) Each Party shall provide for criminal procedures and penalties to be applied at least in cases of wilful trademark counterfeiting or copyright piracy on a commercial scale. Wilful copyright piracy on a commercial scale includes: 


(i) 	significant wilful infringements of copyright, that have no direct or indirect motivation of financial gain; and 


(ii) 	wilful infringements for the purposes of commercial advantage or financial gain. 
(b) 	Each Party shall treat wilful importation or exportation17-28 of pirated copyright goods or of counterfeit trademark goods as unlawful activities subject to criminal penalties to at least the same extent as trafficking or distributing such goods in domestic commerce. 

27. In cases of wilful trademark counterfeiting or copyright piracy on a commercial scale, each Party shall provide: 


(a) 	penalties that include imprisonment and monetary fines sufficiently high to provide a deterrent to infringement consistent with a policy of removing the monetary incentive of the infringer.  Also, each Party shall encourage its judicial authorities to impose fines at levels sufficient to provide a deterrent to future infringements; 


(b) 	that its judicial authorities shall have the authority to order the seizure of suspected counterfeit or pirated goods, any related materials and implements that have been used in the commission of the offence, any assets traceable to the infringing activity, and any documentary evidence relevant to the offence;17-29 


(c) 	that its judicial authorities shall have the authority, among other measures, to order the forfeiture of any assets traceable to the infringing activity for at least indictable offences, and shall, except in exceptional circumstances, order the forfeiture and destruction of all goods found to be counterfeit or pirated, and, at least with respect to wilful copyright piracy, order the forfeiture and destruction of materials and implements that have been used in the creation of the infringing goods. Each Party shall further provide that such forfeiture and destruction shall occur without compensation to the defendant; and 


(d) 	that the appropriate authorities, as determined by each Party, shall have the authority to initiate criminal legal action ex officio with respect to the offences described in this Chapter without the need for a formal complaint by a private party or right holder. 
17-28A Party may comply with paragraph 26(b) in relation to exportation through its measures concerning distribution or trafficking. 

28. Each Party shall provide for criminal procedures and penalties for the knowing transport, transfer, or other disposition of, in the course of trade, or the making or obtaining control of, with intent to so transport, transfer, or otherwise dispose of, in the course of trade, to another for anything of value: 


(a) 	either false or counterfeit labels affixed or designed to be affixed to, at least the following: 


(i) 	a phonogram; 


(ii) 	a copy of a computer program or documentation; 
(iii) 	the packaging for a computer program; or 

(iv) 	a copy of a motion picture or other audiovisual work; or 

(b) 	counterfeit documentation or packaging for a computer program where the documentation or packaging has been made or obtained without the authorisation of the right holder. 
Limitations on liability for service providers 

29. Consistent with Article 41 of the TRIPS Agreement, for the purposes of providing enforcement procedures that permit effective action against any act of copyright infringement 

17-29Each Party shall provide that items that are subject to seizure pursuant to any such judicial order need not be individually identified so long as they fall within general categories specified in the order. 

covered under this Chapter, including expeditious remedies to prevent infringements and criminal and civil remedies, each Party shall provide, consistent with the framework specified in this Article: 


(a) 	legal incentives for service providers to cooperate with copyright owners in deterring the unauthorised storage and transmission of copyrighted materials; and 


(b) 	limitations in its law regarding the scope of remedies available against service providers for copyright infringements that they do not control, initiate, or direct, and that take place through systems or networks controlled or operated by them or on their behalf, as set forth in this sub-paragraph.17-30 


(i) 	These limitations shall preclude monetary relief and provide reasonable restrictions on court-ordered relief to compel or restrain certain actions for the following functions, and shall be confined to those functions:17-31 


(A) 	transmitting, routing, or providing connections for material without modification of its content, or the intermediate and transient storage of such material in the course thereof; 


(B) 	caching carried out through an automatic process; 


(C) 	storage at the direction of a user of material residing on a system or network controlled or operated by or for the service provider; and 


(D) 	referring or linking users to an online location by using information location tools, including hyperlinks and directories. 

(ii) 	These limitations shall apply only where the service provider does not initiate the chain of transmission of the material and does not select the material or its recipients (except to the extent that a function described in clause (i)(D) in itself entails some form of selection). 
(iii) 	Qualification by a service provider for the limitations as to each function in clause (i)(A) through (D) shall be considered separately from qualification for the limitations as to each other function, in accordance with the conditions for qualification set forth in clauses (iv) through (vii). 

(iv) 	With respect to function referred to in clause (i)(B), the limitations shall be conditioned on the service provider: 

17-30Paragraph 29(b) is without prejudice to the availability of defences to copyright infringement that are of general applicability. 17-31Either Party may request consultations with the other Party to consider how to address under this paragraph functions of a similar nature to the functions identified in paragraphs (A) through (D) above that a Party identifies after the entry into force of this Agreement.  


(A) 	permitting access to cached material in significant part only to users of its system or network who have met conditions on user access to that material; 


(B) 	complying with rules concerning the refreshing, reloading, or other updating of the cached material when specified by the person making the material available online in accordance with a relevant industry standard data communications protocol for the system or network through which that person makes the material available that is generally accepted in the Party’s territory; 


(C) 	not interfering with technology used at the originating site consistent with industry standards generally accepted in the Party’s territory to obtain information about the use of the material, and not modifying its content in transmission to subsequent users; and 


(D) 	expeditiously removing or disabling access, on receipt of an effective notification of claimed infringement, to cached material that has been removed or access to which has been disabled at the originating site. 

(v) 	With respect to functions referred to in clause (i)(C) and (D), the limitations shall be conditioned on the service provider: 


(A) 	not receiving a financial benefit directly attributable to the infringing activity, in circumstances where it has the right and ability to control such activity; 


(B) 	expeditiously removing or disabling access to the material residing on its system or network on obtaining actual knowledge of the infringement or becoming aware of facts or circumstances from which the infringement was apparent, such as through effective notifications of claimed infringement in accordance with clause (ix); and 


(C) 	publicly designating a representative to receive such notifications. 

(vi) 	Eligibility for the limitations in this sub-paragraph shall be conditioned on the service provider: 


(A) 	adopting and reasonably implementing a policy that provides for termination in appropriate circumstances of the accounts of repeat infringers; and 


(B) 	accommodating and not interfering with standard technical measures accepted in the Party’s territory that protect and identify 
copyrighted material, that are developed through an open, voluntary process by a broad consensus of copyright owners and service providers, that are available on reasonable and nondiscriminatory terms, and that do not impose substantial costs on service providers or substantial burdens on their systems or networks. 

(vii) 	Eligibility for the limitations in this subparagraph may not be conditioned on the service provider monitoring its service, or affirmatively seeking facts indicating infringing activity, except to the extent consistent with such technical measures. 

(viii) 	If the service provider qualifies for the limitations with respect to the function referred to in clause (i)(A), court-ordered relief to compel or restrain certain actions shall be limited to terminating specified accounts, or to taking reasonable steps to block access to a specific, non-domestic online location. If the service provider qualifies for the limitations with respect to any other function in clause (i), court-ordered relief to compel or restrain certain actions shall be limited to removing or disabling access to the infringing material, terminating specified accounts, and other remedies that a court may find necessary provided that such other remedies are the least burdensome to the service provider among comparably effective forms of relief. Each Party shall provide that any such relief shall be issued with due regard for the relative burden to the service provider and harm to the copyright owner, the technical feasibility and effectiveness of the remedy, and whether less burdensome, comparably effective enforcement methods are available.  Except for orders ensuring the preservation of evidence, or other orders having no material adverse effect on the operation of the service provider’s communications network, each Party shall provide that such relief shall be available only where the service provider has received notice and an opportunity to appear before the judicial authority. 


(ix) 	For the purposes of the notice and take down process for the functions referred to in clause (i)(C) and (D), each Party shall establish appropriate procedures for effective notifications of claimed infringement, and effective counter-notifications by those whose material is the subject of a notice for removal or disabling, on the basis of a good faith belief that it was issued by mistake or misidentification in accordance with clause (v)(B). Each Party shall also provide for monetary remedies against any person who makes a knowing material misrepresentation in a notification or counter-notification that causes injury to any interested party as a result of a service provider relying on the misrepresentation. 


(x) 	If the service provider removes or disables access to material in good faith based on claimed or apparent infringement, each Party shall provide that the service provider shall be exempted from liability for any resulting claims, provided that, in the case of material residing on its system or network, it takes reasonable steps promptly to notify the person making the material available on its system or network that it has done so and, if such person makes an effective counter-notification and is subject to jurisdiction in an infringement suit, to restore the material online unless the person giving the original effective notification seeks judicial relief within a reasonable time. 


(xi) 	Each Party shall provide for an administrative or judicial procedure enabling copyright owners who have given effective notification of claimed infringement to obtain expeditiously from a service provider information in its possession identifying the alleged infringer. 
(xii) 	For the purposes of the function referred to in clause (i)(A), service provider means a provider of transmission, routing, or connections for digital online communications without modification of their content between or among points specified by the user of material of the user’s choosing, and for the purposes of the functions referred to in clause (i)(B) through (D), service provider means a provider or operator of facilities for online services or network access.</article>

2. Recognizing the right of each Party to establish its own labour standards, and to adopt or modify accordingly its labour laws, each Party shall strive to ensure that its laws provide for labour standards consistent with the internationally recognised labour principles and rights set forth in Article 18.7 and shall strive to improve those standards consistent with the goal of maintaining high quality and high productivity workplaces.</article>

3. On request of a Party, or on its own initiative, the panel may seek information and technical advice from any person or body that it deems appropriate, provided that the Parties so agree and subject to such terms and conditions as the Parties may agree.</article>
      <article number="ARTICLE 21.9" name="Panel Report" article_identifier="5282">1. Unless the Parties agree otherwise, the panel shall, within 180 days after the chair is appointed, present to the Parties an initial report containing findings of fact, and its determination regarding: 


(a) 	whether the measure at issue is inconsistent with the obligations of this Agreement; 


(b) 	whether a Party has otherwise failed to carry out its obligations under this Agreement; or  


(c) 	whether a Party’s measure is causing nullification or impairment in the sense of Article 21.2(c); and 


(d) 	 any other matter that the Parties have jointly requested that the Panel address, 
as well as reasons for its findings and determinations. 


2. The panel shall consider this Agreement in accordance with applicable rules of interpretation under international law as reflected in Articles 31 and 32 of the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties (1969). It shall base its report on the relevant provisions of the Agreement and the submissions and arguments of the Parties.  The panel may, at the request of the Parties, make recommendations for the resolution of the dispute. 


3. After considering any written comments by the Parties on the initial report, the panel may modify its report and make any further examination it considers appropriate. 


4. The panel shall present a final report to the Parties within 45 days of presentation of the initial report, unless the Parties otherwise agree.  The Parties shall release the final report to the public within 15 days thereafter, subject to the protection of confidential information.</article>
      <article number="ARTICLE 21.10" name="Implementation Of The Final Report" article_identifier="5283">1. On receipt of the final report of a panel, the Parties shall agree on the resolution of the dispute, which normally shall conform with the determinations and recommendations, if any, of the panel. 


2. If, in its final report, the panel determines that a Party has not conformed with its obligations under this Agreement or that a Party’s measure is causing nullification or impairment in the sense of Article 21.2(c), the resolution, whenever possible, shall be to eliminate the nonconformity or the nullification or impairment.</article>
      <article number="ARTICLE 21.11" name="Non-Implementation" article_identifier="5284">1. If a panel has made a determination of the type described in Article 21.10.2, and the Parties are unable to reach agreement on a resolution pursuant to Article 21.10.1 within 45 days of receiving the final report, or such other period as the Parties agree, the Party complained against shall enter into negotiations with the other Party with a view to developing mutually acceptable compensation. 


2. 	If the Parties: 


(a) 	are unable to agree on compensation within 30 days after the period for developing such compensation has begun, or 


(b) 	have agreed on compensation or on a resolution pursuant to Article 21.10 and the complaining Party considers that the other Party has failed to observe the terms of such agreement, 
the complaining Party may at any time thereafter provide written notice to the office designated by the other Party pursuant to Article 21.3 that it intends to suspend the application to the other Party of benefits of equivalent effect.  The notice shall specify the level of benefits that the Party proposes to suspend. Subject to paragraph 5, the complaining Party may begin suspending benefits 30 days after the later of the date on which it provides notice to the other Party’s designated office under this paragraph or the panel issues its determination under paragraph 3, as the case may be. 

3. 	If the Party complained against considers that:  


(a) 	the level of benefits that the other Party has proposed to be suspended is manifestly excessive; or 


(b) 	it has eliminated the non-conformity or the nullification or impairment that the panel has found, 
it may, within 30 days after the complaining Party provides notice under paragraph 2, request that the panel be reconvened to consider the matter.  The Party complained against shall deliver its request in writing to the office designated by the other Party pursuant to Article 21.3.  The panel shall reconvene as soon as possible after delivery of the request to the designated office and shall present its determination to the Parties within 90 days after it reconvenes to review a request under either subparagraph (a) or (b), or within 120 days for a request under both subparagraphs (a) and (b).  If the panel determines that the level of benefits proposed to be suspended is manifestly excessive, it shall determine the level of benefits it considers to be of equivalent effect. 


4. The complaining Party may suspend benefits up to the level the panel has determined under paragraph 3 or, if the panel has not determined the level, the level the Party has proposed to suspend under paragraph 2, unless the panel has determined that the Party complained against has eliminated the non-conformity, or the nullification or impairment. 


5. The complaining Party may not suspend benefits if, within 30 days after it provides written notice of intent to suspend benefits or, if the panel is reconvened under paragraph 3, within 20 days after the panel provides its determination, the  

Party complained against provides written notice to the other Party’s office designated pursuant to Article 21.3 that it will pay an annual monetary assessment.  The Parties shall consult, beginning no later than ten days after the Party complained against provides notice, with a view to reaching agreement on the amount of the assessment.  If the Parties are unable to reach an agreement within 30 days after consultations begin, the amount of the assessment shall be set at a level, in U.S. dollars, equal to 50 percent of the level of the benefits the panel has determined under paragraph 3 to be of equivalent effect or, if the panel has not determined the level, 50 percent of the level that the complaining Party has proposed to suspend under paragraph 2. 

6. Unless the Joint Committee decides otherwise, a monetary assessment shall be paid to the complaining Party in U.S. currency, or in an equivalent amount of Australian currency, in equal, quarterly instalments beginning 60 days after the Party complained against gives notice that it intends to pay an assessment.  Where the circumstances warrant, the Joint Committee may decide that an assessment shall be paid into a fund established by the Joint Committee and expended at the direction of the Joint Committee for appropriate initiatives to facilitate trade between the Parties, including by further reducing unreasonable trade barriers or by assisting a Party in carrying out its obligations under the Agreement. 


7. If the Party complained against fails to pay a monetary assessment, the complaining Party may suspend the application to the Party complained against of benefits in accordance with paragraph 4. 


8. 	This Article shall not apply with respect to a matter described in Article 21.12.1.</article>
      <article number="ARTICLE 21.12" name="Non-Implementation In Certain Disputes" article_identifier="5285">1. If, in its final report, a panel determines that a Party has not conformed with its obligations under Article 18.2.1(a) or Article 19.2.1(a), and the Parties: 


(a) 	are unable to reach agreement on a resolution pursuant to Article 21.10.1 within 45 days of receiving the final report; or 


(b) 	have agreed on a resolution pursuant to Article 21.10.1 and the complaining Party considers that the other Party has failed to observe the terms of the agreement, 
the complaining Party may at any time thereafter request that the panel be reconvened to impose an annual monetary assessment on the other Party.  The complaining Party shall deliver its request in writing to the office designated by the other Party pursuant to Article 21.3.  The panel shall reconvene as soon as possible after delivery of the request to the designated office. 

2. The panel shall determine the amount of the monetary assessment in U.S. dollars within 90 days after it reconvenes under paragraph 1.  In determining the amount of the assessment, the panel shall take into account: 


(a) 	the bilateral trade effects of the Party’s failure to effectively enforce the relevant law; 


(b) 	the pervasiveness and duration of the Party’s failure to effectively enforce the relevant law; 


(c) 	the reasons for the Party’s failure to effectively enforce the relevant law; 

d) 	the level of enforcement that could reasonably be expected of the Party given its resource constraints; 

(e) 	the efforts made by the Party to begin remedying the non-enforcement after the final report of the panel; and 


(f) 	any other relevant factors. 
The amount of the assessment determined by the Panel shall not exceed 15 million U.S. dollars annually, adjusted for inflation as specified in Annex 21-A. 


3. On the date on which the panel determines the amount of the monetary assessment under paragraph 2, or at any other time thereafter, the complaining Party may provide notice in writing to the office designated by the Party complained against pursuant to Article 21.3 demanding payment of the monetary assessment.  The monetary assessment shall be payable in U.S. currency, or in an equivalent amount of Australian currency, in equal, quarterly instalments beginning 60 days after the complaining Party provides such notice. Each of the first four quarterly instalments shall be equal to one quarter of the monetary assessment determined by the panel under Article 21.12.2. The fifth quarterly instalment and subsequent quarterly instalments shall be adjusted for inflation as specified in Annex 21-A. 


4. Assessments shall be paid into a fund established by the Joint Committee and shall be expended at the direction of the Joint Committee for appropriate labour or environmental initiatives, including efforts to improve or enhance labour or environmental law enforcement, as the case may be, in the territory of the Party complained against, consistent with its law.  In deciding how to expend monies paid into the fund, the Joint Committee shall consider the views of interested persons in each Party’s territory. 


5. If the Party complained against fails to pay a monetary assessment, and if the Party has created and funded an escrow account to ensure payment of any assessments against it, the other Party shall, before having recourse to any other measure, seek to obtain the funds from the account. 


6. If the complaining Party cannot obtain the funds from the other Party’s escrow account within 30 days of the date on which payment is due, or if the other Party has not created an escrow account, the complaining Party may take other appropriate steps to collect the assessment or otherwise secure compliance. These steps may include suspending tariff benefits under the Agreement as necessary to collect the assessment, while bearing in mind the Agreement’s 
objective of eliminating barriers to bilateral trade and while seeking to avoid unduly affecting parties or interests not party to the dispute.</article>
      <article number="ARTICLE 21.13" name="Compliance Review" article_identifier="5286">1. Without prejudice to the procedures set out in Article 21.11.3, if the Party complained against considers that it has eliminated the non-conformity or the nullification or impairment that the panel has found, it may refer the matter to the panel by providing written notice to the office designated by the other Party pursuant to Article 21.3.  The panel shall issue its report on the matter within 90 days after the Party complained against provides notice. 


2. If the panel decides that the Party complained against has eliminated the non-conformity or the nullification or impairment, the complaining Party shall promptly reinstate any benefits it has suspended under Article 21.11 or 21.12, and the Party complained against shall no longer be required to pay any monetary assessment it has agreed to pay under Article 21.11.5 or that has been imposed on it under Article 21.12.</article>

(b) 	to preclude a Party from applying measures that it considers necessary for the fulfilment of its obligations with respect to the maintenance or restoration of international peace or security, or the protection of its own essential security interests.</article>
      <article number="ARTICLE 22.3" name="Taxation" article_identifier="5291">1. Except as set out in this Article, nothing in this Agreement shall apply to taxation measures. 


2. 	(a) Nothing in this Agreement shall affect the rights and obligations of either Party under any tax convention. In the event of any inconsistency between this Agreement and any such convention, that convention shall prevail to the extent of the inconsistency. 
(b) 	In the case of a tax convention between the Parties the competent authorities under that convention shall have sole responsibility for 

22-1 


determining whether any inconsistency exists between this Agreement and that convention. 

3. 	Notwithstanding paragraph 2: 


(a) 	Article 2.2 (National Treatment) and such other provisions of this Agreement as are necessary to give effect to that Article shall apply to taxation measures to the same extent as does GATT 1994 Article III; and 


(b) 	Article 2.11 (Export Taxes) shall apply to taxation measures. 
4. 	Subject to paragraph 2:

(b) 	Where a Party alleges in writing that a taxation measure of the other Party is an expropriation, that other Party’s designated authority may request in writing consultations between the designated authorities regarding whether a determination that the taxation measure is an expropriation under this Agreement would give rise to an inconsistency with any tax convention between the Parties.  Unless the designated authorities agree within sixty days after receipt of the request for consultations (which period may be extended by mutual agreement of such designated authorities) that an inconsistency would arise in case of such determination, the Party alleging an expropriation may pursue the matter under Section B of Chapter 21 (Dispute Settlement Procedures).  Notwithstanding subparagraph 2(b), the designated authorities shall have sole responsibility with respect to this issue of whether a determination that a taxation measure alleged by a Party to be an expropriation under this Agreement would give rise to an inconsistency with any tax convention between the Parties. 


(c) 	For the purposes of this paragraph, designated authority means: 


(i) 	in the case of Australia, the Secretary to the Treasury or his authorised representative; and 


(ii) 	in the case of the United States, the Assistant Secretary of the Treasury (Tax Policy).
