      <article number="ARTICLE 3" name="Trade In Services" article_identifier="7407">1. This Article applies to measures by a Party affecting trade in services between the Parties. 

1  For purposes of this Agreement, "schedule" shall include both the schedule and headnotes. 

2. 	(a) With respect to market access through the modes of supply identified in Article I of the GATS, each Party shall accord services and service suppliers of the other Party treatment no less favorable than that provided for under the terms, limitations, and conditions agreed and specified in its Services Schedule to Annex 3.1 to this Agreement. In sectors where such market access commitments are undertaken, the measure which a Party shall not maintain or adopt either on the basis of a regional subdivision or on the basis of its entire territory, unless otherwise specified in its Services Schedule to Annex 3.1, are those measures defined in Article XVI:2(a)-(f) of the GATS. 


(b) In the sectors inscribed in its Services Schedule to Annex 3.1, and subject to any conditions and qualifications set out therein, each Party shall accord to services and service suppliers of the other Party, in respect of all measures affecting the supply of services, treatment no less favorable than that it accords to its own like services and service suppliers. 


(c) 	(i) Subject to subparagraph (c)(ii), any market access or national treatment commitment inscribed in a Party’s Services Schedule to Annex 3.1 shall give rise to the same rights and obligations2 between the Parties as if that commitment had been inscribed in that Party’s schedule of specific commitments annexed to the GATS.3 
(ii) The provisions of GATS that shall be construed to give rise to rights and obligations under this Article are: Articles IIIbis; VI:1, 2, 3, 5, 6; VII:1 &amp; 2; VIII:1, 2, 5; IX; XI; XII; XIII:1; XIV; XV:2; XVI; XVII; XVIII; XX:2; and XXVII; Annex on Movement of Natural Persons Supplying Services under the Agreement; Annex on Financial Services; Annex on Air Transport, paragraphs 1, 2, 3, 4, 6; and Annex on Telecommunications, paragraphs 1-5.

4. 	(a) Unless they are specifically defined in this Article or in the Services Schedules to Annex 3.1, terms used in this Article and such Services Schedules that are also used in the GATS shall be construed in accordance with their meaning in the GATS, mutatis mutandis. 


(b) All references in this Article to the GATS are to the GATS in effect on the date of entry into force of this Agreement.  If, after that date, a Party alters its schedule of specific commitments annexed to the GATS, the GATS is amended, or the results of the negotiations described in GATS Articles VI:4, X:1, XIII:2, or XV:1 enter into effect, this Article shall be amended, as appropriate, after consultations between the Parties. 


(c) Reference in this Article to a provision of the GATS includes any footnote to that provision.

(d) Articles 1 through 23 of the WIPO Performances and Phonograms Treaty (1996) (“WPPT”).5 

2. Each Party shall make best efforts to ratify or accede to the Patent Cooperation Treaty (1984) and the Protocol Relating to the Madrid Agreement Concerning the International Registration of Marks (1989). 


3. Each Party shall accord to nationals of the other Party treatment no less favorable than it accords to its own nationals with regard to the protection6 and enjoyment of all intellectual property rights and any benefits derived therefrom, subject to the exceptions provided in this Article. 


4. A Party may derogate from paragraph 3 in relation to its judicial and administrative procedures, including the designation of an address for service or the appointment of an agent within the jurisdiction of the other Party, only where such derogations are necessary to secure compliance with laws and regulations that are not inconsistent with the provisions of this Agreement and where such practices are not applied in a manner that would constitute a disguised restriction on trade. 


5. The obligations under paragraphs 3 and 4 do not apply to procedures provided in multilateral agreements concluded under the auspices of WIPO relating to the acquisition or maintenance of intellectual property rights. 
4 Articles 1(4) and 6(2) of the WCT shall be excepted from this Agreement.  Such exception shall be without prejudice to each Party’s respective rights and obligations under the WCT, the Berne Convention for the Protection of Literary and Artistic Works (1971) (“Berne Convention”) and the Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (“TRIPS”). 

5 Articles 5, 8(2), 12(2), and 15 of the WPPT shall be excepted from this Agreement. Such exception shall be without prejudice to each Party’s respective rights and obligations under the WPPT, the Berne Convention and TRIPS. 

6  For purposes of paragraphs 3 and 4, “protection” shall include matters affecting the availability, acquisition, scope, maintenance and enforcement of intellectual property rights as well as uses of intellectual property rights specifically covered by this Agreement. 
Trademarks and Geographical Indications 


6. Trademarks shall include service marks, collective marks and certification marks,7 and may include geographical indications.8 


7. The owner of a registered trademark shall have the exclusive right to prevent all third parties not having the owner's consent from using in the course of trade identical or similar signs, including geographical indications, for goods or services which are related to those in respect of which the trademark is registered, where such use would result in a likelihood of confusion. 


8. Article 6bis of the Paris Convention for the Protection of Industrial Property (1967) (“Paris Convention”) shall apply, mutatis mutandis, to goods or services which are not similar to those identified by a well-known trademark, whether registered or not, provided that use of that trademark in relation to those goods or services would indicate a connection between those goods or services and the owner of the trademark and provided that the interests of the owner of the trademark are likely to be damaged by such use. 


9. Neither Party shall require recordal of trademark licenses to establish the validity of the license or to assert any rights in a trademark. 
Copyright and Related Rights 


10. Each Party shall provide that all reproductions, whether temporary or permanent, shall be deemed reproductions and subject to the reproduction right as envisaged in the provisions embodied in WCT Article 1(4) and the Agreed Statement thereto, and WPPT Articles 7 and 11 and the Agreed Statement thereto. 


11. Each Party shall provide to authors and their successors in interest, to performers and to producers of phonograms the exclusive right to authorize or prohibit the importation into each Party’s territory of copies of works and phonograms, even where such copies were made with the authorization of the author, performer or producer of the phonogram or a successor in interest. 


12. Each Party shall provide to performers and producers of phonograms the exclusive right to authorize or prohibit the broadcasting and communication to the public of their performances or phonograms, regardless of whether the broadcast or communication is effected by wired or wireless means, except that a Party may provide exemptions for analog transmissions and free over-the-air broadcasts, and may introduce statutory licenses for non-interactive services that, by virtue of their programming practices, including both the content of their transmissions and their use of technological measures to prevent unauthorized uses, are unlikely to conflict with a normal exploitation of phonograms or performances. 
7  Neither Party is obligated to treat certification marks as a separate category in national law, provided that such marks are protected. 

8  A geographical indication shall be considered a trademark to the extent that the geographical indication consists of any sign, or any combination of signs, capable of identifying a good or service as originating in the territory of a Party, or a region or locality in that territory, where a given quality, reputation or other characteristic of the good or service is essentially attributable to its geographical origin. 


13. In applying the prohibition under Article 11 of the WCT and Article 18 of the WPPT on circumvention of effective technological measures that are used by authors, performers and producers of phonograms in connection with the exercise of their rights and that restrict unauthorized acts in respect of their works, performances and phonograms, each Party shall prohibit civilly and criminally the manufacture, importation or circulation of any technology, device, service or part thereof, that is designed, produced, performed or marketed for engaging in such prohibited conduct, or that has only a limited commercially significant purpose or use other than enabling or facilitating such conduct.9 


14. Each Party shall provide that any natural person or legal entity acquiring or holding any economic rights by contract or otherwise, including contracts of employment involving protected subject matter, may freely and separately transfer such rights by contract and shall be able to exercise those rights in its own name and enjoy fully benefits of such rights. 


15. Each Party shall issue appropriate laws, regulations, or other measures (“measures”) providing that all government agencies use only computer software authorized for intended use. Such measures shall actively regulate the acquisition and management of software for government use. 


16. Each Party shall confine limitations or exceptions to exclusive rights to certain special cases which do not conflict with a normal exploitation of the work and do not unreasonably prejudice the legitimate interests of the right holders. 
Patents 


17. Subject to paragraph 18, patents shall be available for any invention, whether product or process, in all fields of technology, provided that it is new, involves an inventive step and is capable of industrial application. 


18. Each Party may exclude from patentability: 


(a) inventions, the prevention within their territory of the commercial exploitation of which is necessary to protect ordre public or morality, including to protect human, animal or plant life or health or to avoid serious prejudice to the environment provided that such exclusion is not made merely because the exploitation is prohibited by their law; 


(b) diagnostic, therapeutic and surgical methods for the treatment of humans or animals. 

19. If a Party permits the use by a third party of a subsisting patent to support an application for marketing approval of a product, the Party shall provide that any product produced under this authority shall not be made, used or sold in the territory of the Party other than for purposes related to meeting requirements for marketing approval, and if export is permitted, the product shall only be exported outside the territory of the Party for purposes of meeting requirements for marketing approval in the Party or in another country that permits the use by a third party of a subsisting patent to support an application for marketing approval of a product. 

9  This provision does not require either Party to mandate that any consumer electronics, telecommunications or computing product not otherwise violating the prohibition be designed to affirmatively respond to any effective technological measure.  Any violation of the prohibition shall be independent of any infringement of copyright or related rights. 

20. Neither Party shall permit the use of the subject matter of a patent without the authorization of the right holder except in the following circumstances: 


(a) to remedy a practice determined after judicial or administrative process to be anti-competitive; 


(b) in cases of public non-commercial use or in the case of a national emergency or other circumstances of extreme urgency, provided that such use is limited to use by government entities or legal entities acting under the authority of a government; or 


(c) on the ground of failure to meet working requirements, provided that importation shall constitute working. 
Where the law of a Party allows for such use pursuant to sub-paragraphs (a), (b) or (c), the Party shall respect the provisions of Article 31 of TRIPS and Article 5A(4) of the Paris Convention. 

21. With regard to filing a patent application, when it is not possible to provide a sufficient written description of the invention to enable others skilled in the art to carry out the invention, each Party shall require a deposit with an “international depository authority,” as defined in the 

Budapest Treaty on the International Recognition of the Deposit of Microorganisms for the Purposes of Patent Procedure (1980). 
Measures Related to Certain Regulated Products 


22. Pursuant to Article 39.3 of TRIPS, each Party, when requiring, as a condition of approving the marketing of pharmaceutical or of agricultural chemical products that utilize new chemical entities,10 the submission of undisclosed test or other data, or evidence of approval in another country,11 the origination of which involves a considerable effort, shall protect such information against unfair commercial use. In addition, each Party shall protect such information against disclosure, except where necessary to protect the public, or unless steps are taken to ensure that the information is protected against unfair commercial use. 


23. With respect to pharmaceutical products that are subject to a patent: 


(a) each Party shall make available an extension of the patent term to compensate the patent owner for unreasonable curtailment of the patent term as a result of the marketing approval process. 


(b) the patent owner shall be notified of the identity of any third party requesting marketing approval effective during the term of the patent. 
Enforcement of Intellectual Property Rights 

10  It is understood that protection for “new chemical entities” shall also include protection for new uses for old chemical entities for a period of three years. 

11 It is understood that, in situations where there is reliance on evidence of approval in another country, Jordan shall at a minimum protect such information against unfair commercial use for the same period of time the other country is protecting such information against unfair commercial use. 


24. Each Party shall provide that, at least in cases of knowing infringement of trademark, copyright and related rights, its judicial authorities shall have the authority to order the infringer to pay the right holder damages adequate to compensate for the injury the right holder has suffered as a result of the infringement and any profits of the infringer that are attributable to the infringement that are not taken into account in computing such damages. Injury to the right holder shall be based upon the value of the infringed-upon item, according to the suggested retail price of the legitimate product, or other equivalent measures established by the right holder for valuing authorized goods. 


25. Each Party shall ensure that its statutory maximum fines are sufficiently high to deter future acts of infringement with a policy of removing the monetary incentive to the infringer, and shall provide its judicial and other competent authorities the authority to order the seizure of all suspected pirated copyright and counterfeit trademark goods and related implements the predominant use of which has been in the commission of the offense, and documentary evidence. 


26. Each Party shall provide, at least in cases of copyright piracy or trademark counterfeiting, that its authorities may initiate criminal actions and border measure actions ex officio, without the need for a formal complaint by a private party or right holder. 


27. In civil cases involving copyright or related rights, each Party shall provide that the natural person or legal entity whose name is indicated as the author, producer, performer or publisher of the work, performance or phonogram in the usual manner shall, in the absence of proof to the contrary, be presumed to be the designated right holder in such work, performance or phonogram. It shall be presumed, in the absence of proof to the contrary, that the copyright or related right subsists in such subject matter. Such presumptions shall pertain in criminal cases until the defendant comes forward with credible evidence putting in issue the ownership or subsistence of the copyright or related right. 


28. Each Party shall provide that copyright piracy involving significant willful infringements that have no direct or indirect motivation of financial gain shall be considered willful copyright piracy on a commercial scale. 
Transition Periods 

29. Each Party shall implement fully the obligations of this Article within the following time periods: 


(a) With respect to all obligations in paragraphs 1(c), 1(d), and 10 through 16, two years from the date of entry into force of this Agreement. In addition, Jordan agrees to accede to and ratify the WCT and WPPT within two years from the date of entry into force of this Agreement.

      <article number="ARTICLE 5" name="Environment" article_identifier="7409">1. The Parties recognize that it is inappropriate to encourage trade by relaxing domestic environmental laws.  Accordingly, each Party shall strive to ensure that it does not waive or otherwise derogate from, or offer to waive or otherwise derogate from, such laws as an encouragement for trade with the other Party. 


2. Recognizing the right of each Party to establish its own levels of domestic environmental protection and environmental development policies and priorities, and to adopt or modify accordingly its environmental laws, each Party shall strive to ensure that its laws provide for high levels of environmental protection and shall strive to continue to improve those laws.

(b) The Parties recognize that each Party retains the right to exercise discretion with respect to investigatory, prosecutorial, regulatory, and compliance matters and to make decisions regarding the allocation of resources to enforcement with respect to other environmental matters determined to have higher priorities.

4. For purposes of this Article, “environmental laws” mean any statutes or regulations of a Party, or provision thereof, the primary purpose of which is the protection of the environment, or the prevention of a danger to human, animal, or plant life or health, through: 


(a) the prevention, abatement or control of the release, discharge, or emission of pollutants or environmental contaminants; 


(b) the control of environmentally hazardous or toxic chemicals, substances, materials and wastes, and the dissemination of information related thereto; or 


(c) the protection or conservation of wild flora or fauna, including endangered species, their habitat, and specially protected natural areas in the Party's territory, 
but does not include any statutes or regulations, or provision thereof, directly related to worker safety or health.</article>
      <article number="ARTICLE 6" name="Labor" article_identifier="7410">1. The Parties reaffirm their obligations as members of the International Labor Organization (“ILO”) and their commitments under the ILO Declaration on Fundamental Principles and Rights at Work and its Follow-up. The Parties shall strive to ensure that such labor principles and the internationally recognized labor rights set forth in paragraph 6 are recognized and protected by domestic law. 


2. The Parties recognize that it is inappropriate to encourage trade by relaxing domestic labor laws.  Accordingly, each Party shall strive to ensure that it does not waive or otherwise derogate from, or offer to waive or otherwise derogate from, such laws as an encouragement for trade with the other Party. 


3. Recognizing the right of each Party to establish its own domestic labor standards, and to adopt or modify accordingly its labor laws and regulations, each Party shall strive to ensure that its laws provide for labor standards consistent with the internationally recognized labor rights set forth in paragraph 6 and shall strive to improve those standards in that light. 


4. 	(a) A Party shall not fail to effectively enforce its labor laws, through a sustained or recurring course of action or inaction, in a manner affecting trade between the Parties, after the date of entry into force of this Agreement. 

(b) The Parties recognize that each Party retains the right to exercise discretion with respect to investigatory, prosecutorial, regulatory, and compliance matters and to make decisions regarding the allocation of resources to enforcement with respect to other labor matters determined to have higher priorities.  Accordingly, the Parties understand that a Party is in compliance with subparagraph (a) where a course of action or inaction reflects a reasonable exercise of such discretion, or results from a bona fide decision regarding the allocation of resources. 

5. The Parties recognize that cooperation between them provides enhanced opportunities to improve labor standards. The Joint Committee established under Article 15 shall, during its regular sessions, consider any such opportunity identified by a Party. 


6. 	For purposes of this Article, “labor laws” means statutes and regulations, or provisions thereof, that are directly related to the following internationally recognized labor rights: 


(a) 	the right of association;

(d) 	a minimum age for the employment of children; and 


(e) acceptable conditions of work with respect to minimum wages, hours of work, and occupational safety and health.</article>

(a) deviating from its existing practice of not imposing customs duties on electronic transmissions; 


(b) imposing unnecessary barriers on electronic transmissions, including digitized products; and 


(c) impeding the supply through electronic means of services subject to a commitment under Article 3 of this Agreement, except as otherwise set forth in the Party’s Services Schedule in Annex 3.1.

      <article number="ARTICLE 9" name="Government Procurement" article_identifier="7413">Pursuant to Jordan’s July 12, 2000, application for accession to the WTO Agreement on Government Procurement, the Parties shall enter into negotiations with regard to Jordan’s accession to that Agreement.</article>
      <article number="ARTICLE 10" name="Safeguard Measures" article_identifier="7414">1. If as a result of the reduction or elimination of a duty13 under this Agreement, an originating good of the other Party is being imported into the territory of a Party in such increased quantities, in absolute terms or relative to domestic production, and under such conditions that the imports of such good from the other Party constitute a substantial cause of serious injury, or threat thereof, to a domestic industry producing a like or directly competitive product, such Party may: 

(a) suspend the further reduction of any rate of duty provided for under this Agreement for the good; or 

12  Paragraphs 1 and 2 of this Article render nationals of Jordan eligible for treaty-trader (E-1) and treaty-investor (E-2) visas subject to the applicable provisions of U.S. laws and corresponding regulations governing entry, sojourn and employment of aliens. They also guarantee similar treatment for U.S. nationals seeking to enter Jordan’s territory. 

13 A determination that an originating good is being imported as a result of the reduction or elimination of a duty provided for in this Agreement shall be made only if such reduction or elimination is a cause which contributes significantly to the increase in imports, but need not be equal to or greater than any other cause. The passage of a period of time between the commencement or termination of such reduction or elimination and the increase in imports shall not by itself preclude the determination referenced in this footnote. If the increase in imports is demonstrably unrelated to such reduction or elimination, the determination referenced in this footnote shall not be made. 


(b) increase the rate of duty on the good to a level not to exceed the lesser of 


(i) the most-favored-nation (MFN) applied rate of duty in effect at the time the measure is taken; and

(c) a Party shall notify the other Party upon initiation of an investigation described in subparagraph (a) and shall consult with the other Party prior to taking the measure; and, if a Party takes a provisional measure pursuant to paragraph 3, the Party shall also notify the other Party prior to taking such measure, and shall initiate consultations with the other Party immediately after such measure is taken; 


(d) no measure shall be maintained: 


(i) except to the extent and for such time as may be necessary to prevent or remedy serious injury and to facilitate adjustment; 


(ii) for a period exceeding four years; or 
(iii) beyond the expiration of the transition period, except with the consent of the Party against whose originating good the measure is taken; 

(e) no measure may be applied against the same originating good on which a measure has previously been taken; 


(f) where the expected duration of the measure is over one year, the importing Party shall progressively liberalize it at regular intervals during the period of application; and 


(g) on termination of the measure, the rate of duty shall be the rate that, according to the Party’s schedule in Annex 2.1 to this Agreement, would have been in effect one 
year after initiation of the measure. Beginning on January 1 of the year following the termination of the action, the Party that has applied the measure shall: 


(i) apply the rate of duty set out in its schedule in Annex 2.1 to this Agreement as if the measure had never been applied; or 


(ii) eliminate the tariff in equal annual stages ending on the date corresponding to the staging category set out in its schedule in Annex 2.1 or its schedule to Annex 2.1. 

3. In critical circumstances where delay would cause damage which it would be difficult to repair, a Party may take a measure described in paragraph 1(a), 1(b), or 1(c) on a provisional basis pursuant to a preliminary determination that there is clear evidence that imports from the other Party have increased as a result of the preferential treatment under this Agreement, and such imports constitute a substantial cause of serious injury, or threat thereof, to the domestic industry. The duration of such provisional measure shall not exceed 200 days, during which time the requirements of subparagraphs 2(a) and 2(b) shall be met. Any tariff increases shall be promptly refunded if the investigation described in subparagraph 2(a) does not result in a finding that the requirements of paragraph 1 are met. The duration of any provisional measure shall be counted as part of the period described in subparagraph 2(d). 


4. The Party applying a measure described in paragraph 1 shall provide to the other Party mutually agreed trade liberalizing compensation in the form of concessions having substantially equivalent trade effects or equivalent to the value of the additional duties expected to result from the measure. If the Parties are unable to agree on compensation, the Party against whose originating good the measure is applied may take tariff action having trade effects substantially equivalent to the measure applied under this Article. The Party taking the tariff action shall apply the action only for the minimum period necessary to achieve the substantially equivalent effects. However, the right to take tariff action shall not be exercised for the first 24 months that the measure is in effect, provided that the measure has been applied as a result of an absolute increase in imports and that such a measure conforms to the provisions of this Article. 


5. The Parties recognize that, because it has recently begun to produce a like or directly competitive product described in paragraph 1, an infant industry may face challenges that more mature industries do not encounter. Each Party shall ensure that the procedures described in paragraph 2 do not create obstacles to infant industries that seek the imposition of such measures. 


6. At its regularly scheduled session for the year commencing 14 years after the date of entry into force of this Agreement, the Joint Committee shall conduct a review of the operation of this Article. Based on the results of this review and on the agreement of the Joint Committee, the transition period may be extended.
