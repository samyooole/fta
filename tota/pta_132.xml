The States parties to this Agreement, 

Recognizing that economic co-operation among developing countries is a key element in the strategy of collective self-reliance and an essential instrument to promote structural changes contributing to a balanced and equitable process of global economic development and the establishment of the New International Economic Order; 

Recognizing also that a Global System of Trade Preference (hereinafter referred to as “GSTP”) would constitute a major instrument for the promotion of trade among developing countries members of the Group of 77, and the increase of production and employment in these countries; 

Bearing in mind the Arusha Programme of Collective Self-Reliance, the Caracas Programme of Action and the Declarations on GSTP adopted by the Ministers of Foreign Affairs of the Group of 77 in New York in 1982, and the Ministerial meetings on GSTP in New Delhi in 1985, in Brasilia in 1986 and in Belgrade in 1988; 

Believing that the establishment of the GSTP should be accorded high priority as a major instrument of South-South co-operation, for the promotion of collective self-reliance as well as for the strengthening of world trade as a whole; 

HAVE AGREED as follows:</article>
    </chapter>
    <chapter number="CHAPTER I" name="Introduction" chapter_identifier="1393">
      <article number="ARTICLE 1" name="Definitions" article_identifier="11373">For the purpose of this Agreement: 


(a) “Participant” means: 


(i) Any member of the Group of 77 listed in annex I which has exchanged concessions and has become party to this Agreement in accordance with its articles 25, 27 or 28; 


(ii) Any sub-regional/regional/inter-regional grouping of developing countries members of the Group of 77 listed in annex I which has exchanged concessions and has become party to this Agreement in accordance with its articles 25, 27 or 28; 

(b) “Least developed country” means a country designated as such by the United Nations; 


(c) “State” or “country” means any state or country member of the Group of 77; 


(d) “Domestic producers” means physical or juridical persons established in the territory of a participant which are engaged in production of commodities and manufactures, including industrial, agricultural, extractive or mining products, in their raw, semi-processed or processed forms in that territory. Furthermore, for the purpose of determining “serious injury” or “threat of serious injury”, the term “domestic producers” in this Agreement shall mean domestic producers as a whole of like or similar products, or those of them whose collective output of the products constitutes a major proportion of the total domestic production of those products; 


(e) 	“Serious injury” means significant damage to domestic producers, of like or similar products resulting from a substantial increase of preferential imports in situations which cause substantial losses in terms of earnings, production or employment unsustainable in the short term. The examination of the impact on the domestic industry concerned shall also include an evaluation of other relevant economic factors and indices having a bearing on the state of the domestic industry of that product; 


(f) 	“Threat of serious injury” means a situation in which a substantial increase of preferential imports is of a nature to cause “serious injury” to domestic producers, and that such injury, although not yet existing, is imminent. A 

determination of threat of serious injury shall be based on facts and not on mere allegation, conjecture, or remote or hypothetical possibility; 

(g) 	“Critical circumstances” means the emergence of an exceptional situation where massive preferential imports are causing or threatening to cause “serious injury” difficult to repair and which calls for immediate action; 


(h) 	“Sectoral agreements” means agreements amongst participants regarding the removal or reduction of tariff, non-tariff and para-tariff barriers as well as other trade promotion or co-operative measures for specified products or groups of products closely related in end use or in production; 


(i) 	“Direct trade measures” means measures conducive to promoting mutual trade of participants such as long- and medium-term contracts containing import and supply commitments in respect of specific products, buy-back arrangements, state trading operations, and government and public procurement; 


(j) 	“Tariffs” means custom duties stipulated in the national tariff schedules of the participants; 


(k) 	“Non-tariffs” means any measure, regulation, or practice, other than “tariffs” and “para-tariffs”, the effect of which is to restrict imports, or to significantly distort trade; 


(l) 	“Para-tariffs” means border charges and fees, other than “Tariffs”, on foreign trade transactions of a tariff-like effect which are levied solely on imports, but not those indirect taxes and charges, which are levied in the same manner on like domestic products. Import charges corresponding to specific services rendered are not considered as para-tariff measures.</article>

A committee of participants (hereinafter referred to as the “Committee”) shall be established, upon entry into force of this Agreement, consisting of the representatives of the Governments of the participants. The Committee shall perform such functions as may be necessary to facilitate the operation and further the objectives of this Agreement. The Committee shall be responsible for reviewing the application of this Agreement and the instruments adopted within its framework, monitoring the implementation of the results of the negotiations, carrying out consultations, making recommendations and taking decisions as required, and, in general, undertaking whatever measures may be required to ensure the adequate implementation of the objectives and the provisions of this Agreement. 


(a) 	The Committee shall keep under review the possibility of promoting further negotiations for the enlargement of the schedules of concessions and for the enhancement of trade among participants through other measures and may at any time sponsor such negotiations.

2. Subject to Rules and Guidelines prescribed in this regard, participants parties to direct trade measures, sectoral agreements or agreements on non-tariff concessions may decide not to extend the concessions linked to such agreements to other participants. Such non-extension shall not have a detrimental impact on the trade interests of other participants, and when it has such an effect, the matter shall be submitted to the Committee for consideration and decision. Such agreements shall be open to all participants in the GSTP through direct negotiations. The Committee shall be informed of the initiation of negotiations on such agreements as well as on their provisions once concluded. 


3. Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraphs 1 and 2 of this article, participants may grant tariff, non-tariff and para-tariff concessions applicable exclusively to exports originating from participating least developed countries.

      <article number="ARTICLE 10" name="Maintenance Of The Value Of Concessions" article_identifier="11382">Subject to terms, conditions or qualifications that might be set out in the schedules containing the concessions granted, a participant shall not impair or nullify these concessions, after entry into force of this Agreement, through the application of any charge or measure restricting commerce other than those existing prior thereto, except where such charge corresponds to an internal tax imposed on a like domestic product, an anti-dumping or countervailing duty, or fees commensurate with the cost of services rendered, and except any measures authorized under articles 13 and 14.</article>

3. Should no agreement be reached between the participants concerned within six months of the receipt of notification and should the notifying participant proceed with its modification or withdrawal of such concessions, the affected participants as determined by the Committee may withdraw or modify equivalent concessions in their appropriate schedules.

      <article number="ARTICLE 13" name="Safeguard Measures" article_identifier="11385">A participant shall be able to take safeguard measures to ward off serious injury or threats of serious injury to domestic producers of like or similar products, which may arise as a direct consequence of unforeseen substantial rise of imports enjoying preferences under the GSTP. 

1. Safeguard measures shall be in accordance with the following rules: 


(a) 	Safeguard measures should be consistent with the aims and objectives of the GSTP. These measures should be applied in a non-discriminatory fashion among the participants in the GSTP. 


(b) 	Safeguard measures should be in effect only to the extent and for such time as may be necessary to prevent or remedy such injury. 


(c) 	As a general rule and except in critical circumstances, all safeguard measures shall be taken after consultation between interested participants. Participants intending to take such safeguard measures will be required to demonstrate to the satisfaction of the concerned parties within the Committee the serious injury or threat thereof justifying such measures. 
2. Safeguard action to ward off serious injury or a threat of injury should be in accordance with the following procedures: 


(a) 	Notification: Any participant intending to take safeguard measures should notify the Committee of its intention, and the Committee shall circulate this notification to all participants. Upon receipt of such notification, interested participants intending to enter into consultations with the initiating participants shall so notify the Committee within 30 days. In critical circumstances when delay could cause damage which would be difficult to repair, action may be taken provisionally without prior consultations, on the condition that consultations shall be effected immediately after taking such action; 


(b) 	Consultation: Interested participants should enter into consultations for the purpose of reaching an agreement as to the nature of the safeguard measures to be taken, or already taken, and its duration, and as to compensation or the renegotiation of concessions. These consultations should be concluded within three months of receipt of the original notification. Should these consultations not lead to an agreement satisfactory to all parties within the time period specified above, the matter should be referred to the Committee for resolution of the issue. Should the Committee fail to resolve the issue within four weeks of the date of its having been referred to it, the parties affected by the safeguard action have the right to withdraw equivalent concessions or other obligations under GSTP of which the Committee does not disapprove of.</article>
      <article number="ARTICLE 14" name="Balance-Of-Payments Measures" article_identifier="11386">If a participant faces serious economic problems during the implementation of the GSTP, such participant shall be able to take measures to meet serious balance-of-payments difficulties. 


1. Any participant, which finds it necessary to institute or intensify quantitative restrictions or other measures limiting imports concerning products or areas where concessions have been offered with a view to forestalling the threat of or stopping a serious decline in its monetary reserves, shall endeavour to do so in order to prevent or remedy such difficulties, in a manner which preserves, as much as possible, the value of negotiated concessions. 


2. Such action shall be notified immediately to the Committee which shall circulate such notification to all participants. 


3. Any participant which takes action according to paragraph 1 of this article shall afford, upon request from any other participant, adequate opportunity for consultations with a view to preserving the stability of the concessions negotiated under the GSTP. If no satisfactory adjustment is effected between the participants concerned within three months of such notification, the matter may be referred to the Committee for a review.</article>
      <article number="ARTICLE 15" name="Rules Of Origin" article_identifier="11387">Products contained in the schedules of concessions annexed to this Agreement shall be eligible for preferential treatment if they satisfy the Rules of Origin, which shall be annexed to and form an integral part of this Agreement.</article>

3. Participants concerned should notify the Committee of the conclusion of long-term and medium-term contracts as soon as possible.</article>
      <article number="ARTICLE 17" name="Special Treatment For Least Developed Countries" article_identifier="11389">1. In accordance with the Ministerial Declaration on the GSTP, the special needs of the least developed countries shall be clearly recognized, and concrete preferential measures in favour of these countries shall be agreed on. 


2. To become a participant a least developed country shall not be required to make concessions on a reciprocal basis, and such participating least developed country shall benefit from the extension of all tariff, para-tariff and non-tariff concessions exchanged in the bilateral/plurilateral negotiations which are multilateralized. 


3. Participating least developed countries should identify their export products for which they may wish to seek concessions in the markets of other participants. Technical assistance by the United Nations and other participants in a position to do so, including the provision of relevant information relating to trade in the products concerned and the major developing import markets, together with market trends and prospects and trade regimes of the participants, should be provided to these countries on a priority basis to assist them in this task. 


4. Participating least developed countries may, with respect to export products and markets identified under paragraph 3 above, make specific requests to other participants for tariff, para-tariff and non-tariff concessions and/or direct trade measures, including longterm contracts. 


5. Special consideration shall be given to exports from participating least developed countries in the application of safeguard measures. 


6. The concessions sought in respect to these products may include: 


(a) 	duty-free access, particularly for processed and semi-processed goods;  


(b) 	the removal of non-tariff barriers; 


(c) 	the removal, where appropriate, of para-tariff barriers; 


(d) 	the negotiation of long-term contracts with a view to assisting participating least developed countries to achieve reasonable levels of sustainable exports of their products. 

7. Participants shall sympathetically consider requests from participating least developed countries for concessions sought under paragraph 6 above and shall endeavour, wherever possible, to meet such requests, in whole or in part, as a manifestation of concrete preferential measures to be agreed on in favour of participating least developed countries.</article>
      <article number="ARTICLE 18" name="Subregional, Regional And Interregional Groupings" article_identifier="11390">Tariff, para-tariff and non-tariff preferences applicable within existing subregional, regional and interregional groupings of developing countries notified and registered in this Agreement shall retain their essential character, and there shall be no obligation on the members of such groupings to extend, nor the right of other participants to enjoy the benefits of such preferences. The provisions of this paragraph shall apply equally to the preferential agreements concluded with a view to creating subregional, regional and interregional groupings of developing countries and to future subregional, regional and interregional groupings of developing countries that will be notified as such and duly registered in this Agreement. Furthermore, these provisions shall apply in equal measures to all tariff, paratariff and non-tariff preferences which may in the future become applicable within such subregional, regional or interregional groupings.</article>

      <article number="ARTICLE 20" name="Nullification Or Impairment" article_identifier="11392">1. If any participant should consider that another participant has altered the value of a concession embodied in its schedule or that any benefit accruing to it directly or indirectly 

under this Agreement is being nullified or impaired as the result of the failure of another participant to carry out any of its obligations under this Agreement or as the result of any other circumstance relevant to the operation of this Agreement, the former may, with a view to the satisfactory adjustment of the matter, make written representations or proposals to the other participants which it considers to be concerned, which thus approached shall give sympathetic consideration to the representations or proposals made to them. 

2.
