(d) for goods purchased on a commodity market;  


(e) where a procuring entity procures a prototype or a first good or service that is developed at its request in the course of, and for, a particular contract for research, experiment, study, or original development.

(b)  Subparagraph (a) shall not apply to any Party that provides effective patent protection for plants by the date of entry into force of this Agreement.  Such Parties shall make all reasonable efforts to ratify or accede to the UPOV Convention 1991.  6.  Each Party shall make all reasonable efforts to ratify or accede to the following agreements:  
(a) the Patent Law Treaty (2000);  


(b) the Hague Agreement Concerning the International Registration of Industrial Designs (1999); and  


(c) the Protocol Relating to the Madrid Agreement Concerning the International Registration of Marks (1989).  
7. Further to Article 1.3 (Relation to Other Agreements), the Parties affirm their existing rights and obligations under the TRIPS Agreement and intellectual property agreements concluded or administered under the auspices of the World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO) and to which they are party.  8. In respect of all categories of intellectual property covered in this Chapter, each Party shall accord to nationals
2
 of the other Parties treatment no less favorable than it accords to its own nationals with regard to the protection
3
 and enjoyment of such intellectual property rights and any benefits derived from such rights.   9. A Party may derogate from paragraph 8 in relation to its judicial and administrative procedures, including any procedure requiring a national of another Party to designate for service of process an address in its territory or to appoint an agent in its territory, provided that such derogation:  (a)  is necessary to secure compliance with laws and regulations that are not inconsistent with this Chapter; and   (b) is not applied in a manner that would constitute a disguised restriction on trade.  10. Paragraph 8 does not apply to procedures provided in multilateral agreements to which the Parties are party concluded under the auspices of WIPO in relation to the acquisition or maintenance of intellectual property rights.  11. Except as it provides otherwise, this Chapter gives rise to obligations in respect of all subject matter existing on the date of entry into force of this Agreement that is protected on that date in the Party where protection is claimed, or that meets or comes subsequently to meet the criteria for protection under this Chapter.  12. Except as otherwise provided in this Chapter, a Party shall not be required to restore protection to subject matter that on the date of entry into force of this Agreement has fallen into the public domain in the Party where the protection is claimed.   13. This Chapter does not give rise to obligations in respect of acts that occurred before the date of entry into force of this Agreement.  14. Each Party shall ensure that all laws, regulations, and procedures concerning the protection or enforcement of intellectual property rights shall be in writing and shall be published,
4
 or where such publication is not practicable, made publicly available, in a national language in such a manner as to enable governments and right holders to become acquainted with them, with the object of making the protection and enforcement of intellectual property rights transparent.   15. Nothing in this Chapter shall be construed to prevent a Party from adopting measures necessary to prevent anticompetitive practices that may result from the abuse of the intellectual property rights set out in this Chapter, provided that such measures are consistent with this Chapter.  16. Recognizing the Parties’ commitment to trade capacity building as reflected in the establishment of the Committee on Trade Capacity Building under Article 19.4 (Committee on Trade Capacity Building) and the importance of trade capacity building activities, the Parties shall cooperate through that Committee in the following initial capacity-building priority activities, on mutually agreed terms and conditions, and subject to the availability of appropriated funds:  
(a) educational and dissemination projects on the use of intellectual property as a research and innovation tool, as well as on the enforcement of intellectual property rights;  


(b) appropriate coordination, training, specialization courses, and exchange of information between the intellectual property offices and other institutions of the Parties; and  


(c) enhancing the knowledge, development, and implementation of the electronic systems used for the management of intellectual property.</article>
      <article number="ARTICLE 15.2" name="Trademarks" article_identifier="2961">1. Each Party shall provide that trademarks shall include collective, certification, and sound marks, and may include geographical indications and scent marks.  A geographical indication is capable of constituting a mark to the extent that the geographical indication consists of any sign, or any combination of signs, capable of identifying a good or service as originating
5
 in the territory of a Party, or a region or locality in that territory, where a given quality, reputation, or other characteristic of the good or service is essentially attributable to its geographical origin.   


2. In view of the obligations of Article 20 of the TRIPS Agreement, each Party shall ensure that measures mandating the use of the term customary in common language as the common name for a good or service (“common name”) including, inter alia, requirements concerning the relative size, placement, or style of use of the trademark in relation to the common name, do not impair the use or effectiveness of trademarks used in relation to such goods.  


3. Each Party shall provide that the owner of a registered trademark shall have the exclusive right to prevent all third parties not having the owner’s consent from using in the course of trade identical or similar signs, including geographical indications, for goods or services that are related to those goods or services in respect of which the owner’s trademark is registered, where such use would result in a likelihood of confusion.  In case of the use of an identical sign, including a geographical indication, for identical goods or services, a likelihood of confusion shall be presumed.  


4. Each Party may provide limited exceptions to the rights conferred by a trademark, such as fair use of descriptive terms, provided that such exceptions take account of the legitimate interest of the owner of the trademark and of third parties.   


5. Article 6bis of the Paris Convention for the Protection of Industrial Property (1967) (Paris Convention) shall apply, mutatis mutandis, to goods or services that are not identical or similar to those identified by a well-known trademark,
6
 whether registered or not, provided that use of that trademark in relation to those goods or services would indicate a connection between those goods or services and the owner of the trademark, and provided that the interests of the owner of the trademark are likely to be damaged by such use.  
6.  Each Party shall provide a system for the registration of trademarks, which shall include:  
(a) providing to the applicant a communication in writing, which may be electronic, of the reasons for any refusal to register a trademark;  


(b) an opportunity for the applicant to respond to communications from the trademark authorities, to contest an initial refusal, and to appeal judicially a final refusal to register;  


(c) an opportunity for interested parties to petition to oppose a trademark application or to seek cancellation of a trademark after it has been registered; and  

(d) a requirement that decisions in opposition or cancellation proceedings be reasoned and in writing.  
7. Each Party shall provide, to the maximum degree practical, a system for the electronic application, processing, registration, and maintenance of trademarks, and work to provide, to the maximum degree practical, a publicly available electronic database – including an on-line database – of trademark applications and registrations.   8.  (a) Each Party shall provide that each registration or publication that concerns a trademark application or registration and that indicates goods or services shall indicate the goods or services by their common names, grouped according to the classes of the classification established by the Nice Agreement Concerning the International Classification of Goods and Services for the Purposes of the Registration of Marks (1979), as revised and amended (Nice Classification).   (b)  Each Party shall provide that goods or services may not be considered as being similar to each other solely on the ground that, in any registration or publication, they appear in the same class of the Nice Classification.  Conversely, each Party shall provide that goods or services may not be considered as being dissimilar from each other solely on the ground that, in any registration or publication, they appear in different classes of the Nice Classification.  9. Each Party shall provide that initial registration and each renewal of registration of a trademark shall be for a term of no less than ten years.  10. No Party may require recordal of trademark licenses to establish the validity of the license, to assert any rights in a trademark, or for other purposes.

      <article number="ARTICLE 15.3" name="Geographical Indications" article_identifier="2962">Definition 
1. For purposes of this Article, geographical indications are indications that identify a good as originating in the territory of a Party, or a region or locality in that territory, where a given quality, reputation, or other characteristic of the good is essentially attributable to its geographical origin. Any sign or combination of signs, in any form whatsoever, shall be eligible to be a geographical indication.  
Procedures with Respect to Geographical Indications  
2. Each Party shall provide the legal means to identify
8
 and protect geographical indications of the other Parties that meet the criteria of paragraph 1.  Each Party shall provide the means for persons of another Party to apply for protection or petition for recognition of geographical indications. Each Party shall accept applications and petitions from persons of another Party without the requirement for intercession by that Party on behalf of its persons.    


3. Each Party shall process applications or petitions, as the case may be, for geographical indications with a minimum of formalities.   


4. Each Party shall make its regulations governing filing of such applications or petitions, as the case may be, readily available to the public.   


5. Each Party shall ensure that applications or petitions, as the case may be, for geographical indications are published for opposition, and shall provide procedures for opposing geographical indications that are the subject of applications or petitions.  Each Party shall also provide procedures to cancel any registration resulting from an application or a petition.  


6. Each Party shall ensure that measures governing the filing of applications or petitions, as the case may be, for geographical indications set out clearly the procedures for these actions.  Each Party shall make available contact information sufficient to allow (a) the general public to obtain guidance concerning the procedures for filing applications or petitions and the processing of those applications or petitions in general; and (b) applicants, petitioners, or their representatives to ascertain the status of, and to obtain procedural guidance concerning, specific applications and petitions.  
Relationship between Trademarks and Geographical Indications  
7. Each Party shall ensure that grounds for refusing protection or recognition of a geographical indication include the following:  


(a) the geographical indication is likely to be confusingly similar to a trademark that is the subject of a good-faith pending application or registration; and  


(b) the geographical indication is likely to be confusingly similar to a pre-existing trademark, the rights to which have been acquired in accordance with the Party’s law.

2. Each Party shall provide to authors, performers, and producers of phonograms the right to authorize the making available to the public of the original and copies of their works, performances, and phonograms
13
 through sale or other transfer of ownership.  


3. In order to ensure that no hierarchy is established between rights of authors, on the one hand, and rights of performers and producers of phonograms, on the other hand, each Party shall establish that in cases where authorization is needed from both the author of a work embodied in a phonogram and a performer or producer owning rights in the phonogram, the need for the authorization of the author does not cease to exist because the authorization of the performer or producer is also required.  Likewise, each Party shall establish that in cases where authorization is needed from both the author of a work embodied in a phonogram and of a performer or producer owning rights in the phonogram, the need for the authorization of the performer or producer does not cease to exist because the authorization of the author is also required.  


4. Each Party shall provide that, where the term of protection of a work (including a photographic work), performance, or phonogram is to be calculated:  


(a) on the basis of the life of a natural person, the term shall be not less than the life of the author and 70 years after the author’s death; and  


(b) on a basis other than the life of a natural person, the term shall be:  


(i) not less than 70 years from the end of the calendar year of the first authorized publication of the work, performance, or phonogram, or   


(ii) failing such authorized publication within 50 years from the creation of the work, performance, or phonogram, not less than 70 years from the end of the calendar year of the creation of the work, performance, or phonogram.

6. Each Party shall provide that for copyright and related rights:  


(a) any person acquiring or holding any economic right in a work, performance, or phonogram may freely and separately transfer such right by contract; and

7.  (a) In order to provide adequate legal protection and effective legal remedies against the circumvention of effective technological measures that authors, performers, and producers of phonograms use in connection with the exercise of their rights and that restrict unauthorized acts in respect of their works, performances, and phonograms, each Party shall provide that any person who:  
(i) circumvents without authority any effective technological measure that controls access to a protected work, performance, phonogram, or other subject matter; or   


(ii) manufactures, imports, distributes, offers to the public, provides, or otherwise traffics in devices, products, or components, or offers to the public or provides services, that:

Each Party shall provide for criminal procedures and penalties to be applied when any person, other than a nonprofit library, archive, educational institution, or public non-commercial broadcasting entity, is found to have engaged willfully and for purposes of commercial advantage or private financial gain in any of the foregoing activities.   (b)  In implementing subparagraph (a), no Party shall be obligated to require that the design of, or the design and selection of parts and components for, a consumer electronics, telecommunications, or computing product provide for a response to any particular technological measure, so long as the product does not otherwise violate any measures implementing subparagraph (a).   (c)  Each Party shall provide that a violation of a measure implementing this paragraph is a separate civil cause of action or criminal offense, independent of any infringement that might occur under the Party’s law on copyright and related rights.   (d)  Each Party shall confine exceptions to any measures implementing the prohibition in subparagraph (a)(ii) on technology, products, services, or devices that circumvent effective technological measures that control access to, and, in the case of clause (i), that protect any of the exclusive rights of copyright or related rights in, a protected work, performance, or phonogram referred to in subparagraph (a)(ii), to the following activities, provided that they do not impair the adequacy of legal protection or the effectiveness of legal remedies against the circumvention of effective technological measures:    (i)  noninfringing reverse engineering activities with regard to a lawfully  obtained copy of a computer program, carried out in good faith with respect  to particular elements of that computer program that have not been readily  available to the person engaged in those activities, for the sole purpose of  achieving interoperability of an independently created computer program  with other programs;    (ii)  noninfringing good faith activities, carried out by an appropriately qualified  researcher who has lawfully obtained a copy, unfixed performance or display  of a work, performance, or phonogram, and who has made a good faith effort  to obtain authorization for such activities, to the extent necessary for the sole  purpose of identifying and analyzing flaws and vulnerabilities of technologies  for scrambling and descrambling of information;    (iii)  the inclusion of a component or part for the sole purpose of preventing the  access of minors to inappropriate on-line content in a technology, product,  service, or device that itself is not prohibited under the measures  implementing subparagraph (a)(ii); and    (iv)  noninfringing good faith activities that are authorized by the owner of a  computer, computer system, or computer network for the sole purpose of  testing, investigating, or correcting the security of that computer, computer  system, or computer network.   (e)  Each Party shall confine exceptions to any measures implementing the prohibition referred to in subparagraph (a)(i) to the activities listed in subparagraph (d) and the following activities, provided that they do not impair the adequacy of legal protection or the effectiveness of legal remedies against the circumvention of effective technological measures:  
(i) access by a nonprofit library, archive, or educational institution to a work, performance, or phonogram, not otherwise available to it, for the sole purpose of making acquisition decisions;  


(ii) noninfringing activities for the sole purpose of identifying and disabling a capability to carry out undisclosed collection or dissemination of personally identifying information reflecting the on-line activities of a natural person in a way that has no other effect on the ability of any person to gain access to any work; and  
(iii)  noninfringing uses of a work, performance, or phonogram, in a particular class of works, performances, or phonograms, when an actual or likely adverse impact on those noninfringing uses is demonstrated in a legislative or administrative proceeding by substantial evidence; provided that in order for any such exception to remain in effect for more than four years, a Party must conduct a review before the expiration of the four-year period and at intervals of at least every four years thereafter, pursuant to which it is demonstrated in such a proceeding by substantial evidence that there is a continuing actual or likely adverse impact on the particular noninfringing use.   (f)  Each Party may provide exceptions to any measures implementing the prohibitions referred to in subparagraph (a) for lawfully authorized activities carried out by government employees, agents, or contractors for law enforcement, intelligence, essential security, or similar governmental purposes.    (g)  Effective technological measure means any technology, device, or component that, in the normal course of its operation, controls access to a protected work, performance, phonogram, or other protected subject matter, or protects any copyright or any rights related to copyright.  8. In order to provide adequate legal protection and effective legal remedies to protect rights management information:  (a) Each Party shall provide that any person who, without authority, and knowing, or, with respect to civil remedies, having reasonable grounds to know, that it would induce, enable, facilitate, or conceal an infringement of any copyright or related right,    (i) knowingly removes or alters any rights management information;     (ii)  distributes or imports for distribution rights management information  knowing that the rights management information has been removed or altered  without authority; or  (iii)  distributes, imports for distribution, broadcasts, communicates or makes available to the public copies of works, performances, or phonograms, knowing that rights management information has been removed or altered without authority,  shall be liable and subject to the remedies provided for in Article 15.11.14. Each Party shall provide for criminal procedures and penalties to be applied when any person, other than a nonprofit library, archive, educational institution, or public non-commercial broadcasting entity, is found to have engaged willfully and for purposes of commercial advantage or private financial gain in any of the foregoing activities.   (b)  Each Party shall confine exceptions to measures implementing subparagraph (a) to lawfully authorized activities carried out by government employees, agents, or contractors for law enforcement, intelligence, national defense, essential security, or similar governmental purposes.    (c)  Rights management information means:    (i)  information that identifies a work, performance, or phonogram, the author of  the work, the performer of the performance, or the producer of the  phonogram, or the owner of any right in the work, performance, or  phonogram; or     (ii)  information about the terms and conditions of the use of the work,  performance, or phonogram; or  (iii)  any numbers or codes that represent such information,   when any of these items is attached to a copy of the work, performance, or phonogram or appears in connection with the communication or making available of a work, performance, or phonogram to the public.  Nothing in this paragraph shall obligate a Party to require the owner of any right in the work, performance, or phonogram to attach rights management information to copies of the work, performance, or phonogram, or to cause rights management information to appear in connection with a communication of the work, performance, or phonogram to the public.  9. In order to confirm that all agencies at the central level of government use computer software only as authorized, each Party shall issue appropriate laws, orders, regulations, or decrees to actively regulate the acquisition and management of software for such use.  These measures may take the form of procedures such as preparing and maintaining inventories of software on agency computers and inventories of software licenses.  10. (a)  With respect to Articles 15.5, 15.6, and 15.7, each Party shall confine limitations or exceptions to exclusive rights to certain special cases that do not conflict with a normal exploitation of the work, performance, or phonogram, and do not unreasonably prejudice the legitimate interests of the right holder.  (b)  Notwithstanding subparagraph (a) and Article 15.7.3(b), no Party may permit the retransmission of television signals (whether terrestrial, cable, or satellite) on the Internet without the authorization of the right holder or right holders of the content of the signal and, if any, of the signal.</article>

For purposes of this Article, a Party may treat the terms “inventive step” and “capable of industrial application” as being synonymous with the terms “non-obvious” and “useful,” respectively.   


2. Nothing in this Chapter shall be construed to prevent a Party from excluding inventions from patentability as set out in Articles 27.2 and 27.3 of the TRIPS Agreement.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, any Party that does not provide patent protection for plants by the date of entry into force of this Agreement shall undertake all reasonable efforts to make such patent protection available.

5. Consistent with paragraph 3, if a Party permits a third person to use the subject matter of a subsisting patent to generate information necessary to support an application for marketing approval of a pharmaceutical or agricultural chemical product, that Party shall provide that any product produced under such authority shall not be made, used, or sold in the territory of that Party other than for purposes related to generating information to meet requirements for approval to market the product once the patent expires, and if the Party permits exportation, the product shall only be exported outside the territory of that Party for purposes of meeting marketing approval requirements of that Party.  
6.  (a) Each Party, at the request of the patent owner, shall adjust the term of a patent to compensate for unreasonable delays that occur in granting the patent.  For purposes of this paragraph, an unreasonable delay shall at least include a delay in the issuance of the patent of more than five years from the date of filing of the application in the territory of the Party, or three years after a request for examination of the application has been made, whichever is later, provided that periods attributable to actions of the patent applicant need not be included in the determination of such delays.   (b) With respect to any pharmaceutical product that is covered by a patent, each Party shall make available a restoration of the patent term to compensate the patent owner for unreasonable curtailment of the effective patent term resulting from the marketing approval process related to the first commercial marketing of the product in that Party.  7. Each Party shall disregard information contained in public disclosures used to determine if an invention is novel or has an inventive step if the public disclosure (a) was made or authorized by, or derived from, the patent applicant, and (b) occurred within 12 months prior to the date of filing of the application in the territory of the Party.  8. Each Party shall provide patent applicants with at least one opportunity to submit amendments, corrections, and observations in connection with their applications.  9. Each Party shall provide that a disclosure of a claimed invention shall be considered to be sufficiently clear and complete if it provides information that allows the invention to be made and used by a person skilled in the art, without undue experimentation, as of the filing date.  10. Each Party shall provide that a claimed invention is sufficiently supported by its disclosure if the disclosure reasonably conveys to a person skilled in the art that the applicant was in possession of the claimed invention as of the filing date.  11. Each Party shall provide that a claimed invention is industrially applicable if it has a specific, substantial, and credible utility.</article>

 (b)  If a Party permits, as a condition of approving the marketing of a new pharmaceutical or agricultural chemical product, third persons to submit evidence concerning the safety or efficacy of a product that was previously approved in another territory, such as evidence of prior marketing approval, the Party shall not permit third persons, without the consent of the person who previously obtained such approval in the other territory, to obtain authorization or to market a product on the basis of (1) evidence of prior marketing approval in the other territory, or (2) information concerning safety or efficacy that was previously submitted to obtain marketing approval in the other territory, for at least five years for pharmaceutical products and ten years for agricultural chemical products from the date approval was granted in the Party’s territory to the person who received approval in the other territory. In order to receive protection under this subparagraph, a Party may require that the person providing the information in the other territory seek approval in the territory of the Party within five years after obtaining marketing approval in the other territory.    (c)  For purposes of this paragraph, a new product is one that does not contain a chemical   entity that has been previously approved in the territory of the Party.   (d)  For purposes of this paragraph, each Party shall protect such undisclosed information against disclosure except where necessary to protect the public, and no Party may consider information accessible within the public domain as undisclosed data. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if any undisclosed information concerning safety and efficacy submitted to a Party, or an entity acting on behalf of a Party, for purposes of obtaining marketing approval is disclosed by such entity, the Party is still required to protect such information from unfair commercial use in the manner set forth in this Article.  2. Where a Party permits, as a condition of approving the marketing of a pharmaceutical product, persons, other than the person originally submitting safety or efficacy information, to rely on evidence or information concerning the safety and efficacy of a product that was previously approved, such as evidence of prior marketing approval in the territory of a Party or in another country, that Party:  
(a) shall implement measures in its marketing approval process to prevent such other persons from marketing a product covered by a patent claiming the previously approved product or its approved use during the term of that patent, unless by consent or acquiescence of the patent owner; and  


(b) shall provide that the patent owner shall be informed of the request and the identity of any such other person who requests approval to enter the market during the term of a patent identified as claiming the approved product or its approved use.</article>
      <article number="ARTICLE 15.11" name="Enforcement Of Intellectual Property Rights" article_identifier="2970">General Obligations  
1. Each Party understands that procedures and remedies required under this Article for enforcement of intellectual property rights are established in accordance with:   
 (a)  the principles of due process that each Party recognizes; and    (b)  the foundations of its own legal system.  
2. This Article does not create any obligation:  
 (a) to put in place a judicial system for the enforcement of intellectual property rights distinct from that for the enforcement of law in general; or    (b) with respect to the distribution of resources for the enforcement of intellectual property rights and the enforcement of law in general.   The Parties understand that the decisions that a Party makes on the distribution of enforcement resources shall not excuse that Party from complying with this Chapter.  
3. Each Party shall provide that final judicial decisions or administrative rulings of general applicability pertaining to the enforcement of intellectual property rights shall be in writing and shall state any relevant findings of fact and the reasoning or the legal basis on which the decisions and rulings are based. Each Party shall provide that such decisions or rulings shall be published,
16
 or where such publication is not practicable, otherwise made publicly available, in a national language in such a manner as to enable governments and right holders to become acquainted with them.  


4. Each Party shall publicize information that it may collect on its efforts to provide effective enforcement of intellectual property rights in its civil, administrative, and criminal system, including any statistical information.   


5. In civil, administrative, and criminal proceedings involving copyright or related rights, each Party shall provide that:  


(a) the person whose name is indicated as the author, producer, performer, or publisher of the work, performance, or phonogram in the usual manner, shall, in the absence of proof to the contrary, be presumed to be the designated right holder in such work, performance, or phonogram; and  


(b) it shall be presumed, in the absence of proof to the contrary, that the copyright or related right subsists in such subject matter.  
Civil and Administrative Procedures and Remedies  
6. Each Party shall make available to right holders
17
 civil judicial procedures concerning the enforcement of any intellectual property right.  


7. Each Party shall provide that:  
(a) in civil judicial proceedings concerning the enforcement of intellectual property rights, its judicial authorities shall have the authority to order the infringer to pay the right holder:  


(i) damages adequate to compensate for the injury the right holder has suffered as a result of the infringement; and   


(ii) at least in the case of copyright or related rights infringement and trademark counterfeiting, the profits of the infringer that are attributable to the infringement and are not taken into account in computing the amount of the damages referred to in clause (i); and   
 (b) in determining damages for infringement of intellectual property rights, its judicial authorities shall consider, inter alia, the value of the infringed-upon good or service based on the suggested retail price or other legitimate measure of value that the right holder presents.  
8. In civil judicial proceedings, each Party shall, at least with respect to civil judicial proceedings concerning copyright or related rights infringement and trademark counterfeiting, establish or maintain pre-established damages as an alternative to actual damages.  Such pre-established damages shall be set out in domestic law and determined by the judicial authorities in an amount sufficient to compensate the right holder for the harm caused by the infringement and constitute a deterrent to future infringements.  


9. Each Party shall provide that its judicial authorities, except in exceptional circumstances, shall have the authority to order, at the conclusion of civil judicial proceedings concerning copyright or related rights infringement and trademark counterfeiting, that the prevailing party shall be awarded payment of court costs or fees and reasonable attorney’s fees by the losing party. Further, each Party shall provide that its judicial authorities, at least in exceptional circumstances, shall have the authority to order, at the conclusion of civil judicial proceedings concerning patent infringement, that the prevailing party be awarded payment of reasonable attorney’s fees by the losing party.  


10. In civil judicial proceedings concerning copyright or related right infringement and trademark counterfeiting, each Party shall provide that its judicial authorities shall have the authority to order the seizure of suspected infringing goods, any related materials and implements, and, at least for trademark counterfeiting, documentary evidence relevant to the infringement.  


11. Each Party shall provide that:  


(a) its judicial authorities shall have the authority to order, at their discretion, the destruction of the goods that have been found to be pirated or counterfeit;  


(b) its judicial authorities shall have the authority to order that materials and implements that have been used in the manufacture or creation of such pirated or counterfeit goods be, without compensation of any sort, promptly destroyed or, in exceptional circumstances, without compensation of any sort, disposed of outside the channels of commerce in such a manner as to minimize the risks of further infringements.  In considering requests for such destruction, the Party’s judicial authorities may take into account, inter alia, the gravity of the infringement, as well as the interests of third parties holding ownership, possessory, contractual, or secured interests;  


(c) the charitable donation of counterfeit trademark goods and goods that infringe copyright and related rights shall not be ordered by the judicial authorities without the authorization of the right holder, except that counterfeit trademark goods may in appropriate cases be donated to charity for use outside the channels of commerce when the removal of the trademark eliminates the infringing characteristic of the good and the good is no longer identifiable with the removed trademark.  In no case shall the simple removal of the trademark unlawfully affixed be sufficient to permit the release of goods into the channels of commerce.  

12. Each Party shall provide that in civil judicial proceedings concerning the enforcement of intellectual property rights, its judicial authorities shall have the authority to order the infringer to provide any information that the infringer possesses regarding any person involved in any aspect of the infringement and regarding the means of production or distribution channel for the infringing goods or services, including the identification of third persons that are involved in their production and distribution and their distribution channels, and to provide this information to the right holder. Each Party shall provide that its judicial authorities shall have the authority to impose sanctions, in appropriate cases, on a party to a proceeding that fails to abide by valid orders issued by such authorities.  


13. To the extent that any civil remedy can be ordered as a result of administrative procedures on the merits of a case, each Party shall provide that such procedures conform to principles equivalent in substance to those provided for in this Chapter.  


14. Each Party shall provide for civil remedies against the acts described in Article 15.5.7 and 15.5.8. Available civil remedies shall include at least:  


(a) provisional measures, including seizure of devices and products suspected of being involved in the prohibited activity;  


(b) actual damages (plus any profits attributable to the prohibited activity not taken into account in computing the actual damages) or pre-established damages as provided in paragraph 8;  


(c) payment to the prevailing right holder, at the conclusion of civil judicial proceedings, of court costs and fees and reasonable attorney’s fees by the party engaged in the prohibited conduct; and  


(d) destruction of devices and products found to be involved in the prohibited activity, at the discretion of the judicial authorities, as provided in subparagraphs (a) and (b) of paragraph 11.  
 No Party may make damages available against a nonprofit library, archives, educational institution, or public broadcasting entity that sustains the burden of proving that it was not aware and had no reason to believe that its acts constituted a prohibited activity.   
15. In civil judicial proceedings concerning the enforcement of intellectual property rights, each Party shall provide that its judicial authorities shall have the authority to order a party to desist from an infringement, inter alia, to prevent the entry into the channels of commerce in their jurisdiction of imported goods that involve the infringement of an intellectual property right, immediately after customs clearance of such goods or to prevent their exportation.  


16. In the event that a Party’s judicial or other authorities appoint technical or other experts in civil proceedings concerning the enforcement of intellectual property rights and require that the parties bear the costs of such experts, the Party should seek to ensure that such costs are closely related, inter alia, to the quantity and nature of work to be performed and do not unreasonably deter recourse to such proceedings.  
Provisional Measures  
17. Each Party shall act on requests for relief inaudita altera parte and execute such requests expeditiously, in accordance with its rules of judicial procedure.   


18. Each Party shall provide that its judicial authorities shall have the authority to require the plaintiff to provide any reasonably available evidence in order to satisfy themselves with a sufficient degree of certainty that the plaintiff’s right is being infringed or that such infringement is imminent, and to order the plaintiff to provide a reasonable security or equivalent assurance set at a level sufficient to protect the defendant and to prevent abuse, and so as not to unreasonably deter recourse to such procedures.  


19. In proceedings concerning the grant of provisional measures in relation to enforcement of a patent, each Party shall provide for a rebuttable presumption that the patent is valid.  
Special Requirements Related to Border Measures 
20. Each Party shall provide that any right holder initiating procedures for its competent authorities to suspend the release of suspected counterfeit or confusingly similar trademark goods, or pirated copyright goods
18
 into free circulation is required to provide adequate evidence to satisfy the competent authorities that, under the laws of the country of importation, there is prima facie an infringement of the right holder’s intellectual property right and to supply sufficient information that may reasonably be expected to be within the right holder’s knowledge to make the suspected goods reasonably recognizable by the competent authorities.  The requirement to provide sufficient information shall not unreasonably deter recourse to these procedures.  


21. Each Party shall provide that its competent authorities shall have the authority to require a right holder initiating procedures for suspension to provide a reasonable security or equivalent assurance sufficient to protect the defendant and the competent authorities and to prevent abuse.  Such security or equivalent assurance shall not unreasonably deter recourse to these procedures.  Each Party shall provide that such security may take a form of an instrument issued by a financial services provider to hold the importer or owner of the imported merchandise harmless from any loss or damage resulting from any suspension of the release of goods in the event the competent authorities determine that the article is not an infringing good.  


22. Where its competent authorities have made a determination that goods are counterfeit or pirated, a Party shall grant its competent authorities the authority to inform the right holder of the names and addresses of the consignor, the importer, and the consignee, and of the quantity of the goods in question.  


23. Each Party shall provide that its competent authorities may initiate border measures  ex officio, with respect to imported, exported, or in-transit merchandise suspected of infringing an intellectual property right, without the need for a formal complaint from a private party or right holder.  


24. Each Party shall provide that goods that have been determined to be pirated or counterfeit by its competent authorities shall be destroyed, pursuant as appropriate to judicial order, unless the right holder consents to an alternate disposition, except that counterfeit trademark goods may in appropriate cases be donated to charity for use outside the channels of commerce, when the removal of the trademark eliminates the infringing characteristic of the good and the good is no longer identifiable with the removed trademark.  In regard to counterfeit trademark goods, the simple removal of the trademark unlawfully affixed shall not be sufficient to permit the release of the goods into the channels of commerce. In no event shall the competent authorities be authorized to permit the exportation of counterfeit or pirated goods or to permit such goods to be subject to other customs procedures, except in exceptional circumstances.  


25. Each Party shall provide that where an application fee or merchandise storage fee is assessed in connection with border measures to enforce an intellectual property right, the fee shall not be set at an amount that unreasonably deters recourse to such measures.  
Criminal Procedures and Remedies  26. (a) Each Party shall provide for criminal procedures and penalties to be applied at least in cases of willful trademark counterfeiting or copyright or related rights piracy on a commercial scale. Willful copyright or related rights piracy on a commercial scale includes significant willful infringements of copyright or related rights, for purposes of commercial advantage or private financial gain, as well as willful infringements that have no direct or indirect motivation of financial gain, provided that there is more than a de minimis financial harm.  Each Party shall treat willful importation or exportation of counterfeit or pirated goods as unlawful activities and provide for criminal penalties to the same extent as the trafficking or distribution of such goods in domestic commerce.
19
(b)  Specifically, each Party shall provide:  
(i) remedies that include sentences of imprisonment or monetary fines, or both, sufficient to provide a deterrent to future acts of infringement.  Each Party shall establish policies or guidelines that encourage penalties to be imposed by judicial authorities at levels sufficient to provide a deterrent to future infringements;  


(ii) that its judicial authorities shall have the authority to order the seizure of suspected counterfeit or pirated goods, any related materials and implements that have been used in the commission of the offense, any assets traceable to the infringing activity, and any documentary evidence relevant to the offense. Each Party shall provide that items that are subject to seizure pursuant to any such judicial order need not be individually identified so long as they fall within general categories specified in the order;  


(iii) that its judicial authorities shall have the authority to order, among other measures, (1) the forfeiture of any assets traceable to the infringing activity, (2) the forfeiture and destruction of all counterfeit or pirated goods, without compensation of any kind to the defendant, in order to prevent the re-entry of counterfeit and pirated goods into channels of commerce, and (3) with respect to willful copyright or related rights piracy, the forfeiture and destruction of materials and implements that have been used in the creation of the infringing goods; and  


(iv) that its authorities may, at least in cases of suspected trademark counterfeiting or copyright piracy, conduct investigations or exercise other enforcement measures ex officio, without the need for a formal complaint by a private party or right holder, at least for the purpose of preserving evidence or preventing the continuation of the infringing activity.   
Limitations on Liability for Service Providers 27.  For the purpose of providing enforcement procedures that permit effective action against any act of infringement of copyright
20
 covered under this Chapter, including expeditious remedies to  prevent infringements, and criminal and civil remedies that constitute a deterrent to further infringements, each Party shall provide, consistent with the framework set out in this Article:  
(a) legal incentives for service providers to cooperate with copyright owners in deterring the unauthorized storage and transmission of copyrighted materials; and   


(b) limitations in its law regarding the scope of remedies available against service providers for copyright infringements that they do not control, initiate or direct, and that take place through systems or networks controlled or operated by them or on their behalf, as set out in this subparagraph.
21
 


(i) These limitations shall preclude monetary relief and provide reasonable restrictions on court-ordered relief to compel or restrain certain actions for the following functions and shall be confined to those functions:   
(A)  transmitting, routing, or providing connections for material without modification of its content, or the intermediate and transient storage of such material in the course thereof;  
   (B)  caching carried out through an automatic process;      (C)  storage at the direction of a user of material residing on a system or     network controlled or operated by or for the service provider; and     (D) referring or linking users to an on-line location by using information     location tools, including hyperlinks and directories.   
(ii) These limitations shall apply only where the service provider does not initiate the chain of transmission of the material and does not select the material or its recipients (except to the extent that a function described in clause (i)(D) in itself entails some form of selection).    


(iii) Qualification by a service provider for the limitations as to each function in clauses (i)(A) through (D) shall be considered separately from qualification for the limitations as to each other function, in accordance with the conditions for qualification set forth in clauses (iv) through (vii).  


(iv) With respect to the function referred to in clause (i)(B), the limitations shall be conditioned on the service provider:  
(A)  permitting access to cached material in significant part only to users  of its system or network who have met conditions on user access to  that material;  
  (B) complying with rules concerning the refreshing, reloading, or other  updating of the cached material when specified by the person making  the material available on-line in accordance with a generally accepted  industry standard data communications protocol for the system or  network through which that person makes the material available;     (C)  not interfering with technology consistent with industry standards  accepted in the Party’s territory used at the originating site to obtain  information about the use of the material, and not modifying its  content in transmission to subsequent users; and    (D)  expeditiously removing or disabling access, on receipt of an effective  notification of claimed infringement, to cached material that has been  removed or access to which has been disabled at the originating site.    
(v) With respect to functions referred to in clauses (i)(C) and (D), the limitations shall be conditioned on the service provider:    
   (A)  not receiving a financial benefit directly attributable to the infringing     activity, in circumstances where it has the right and ability to control     such activity;     (B)  expeditiously removing or disabling access to the material residing  on its system or network on obtaining actual knowledge of the  infringement or becoming aware of facts or circumstances from  which the infringement was apparent, such as through effective  notifications of claimed infringement in accordance with clause (ix);  and     (C)  publicly designating a representative to receive such notifications.  
(vi) Eligibility for the limitations in this subparagraph shall be conditioned on the service provider:  
 (A)  adopting and reasonably implementing a policy that provides for  termination in appropriate circumstances of the accounts of repeat  infringers; and    (B)  accommodating and not interfering with standard technical measures  accepted in the Party’s territory that protect and identify copyrighted  material, that are developed through an open, voluntary process by a  broad consensus of copyright owners and service providers, that are  available on reasonable and nondiscriminatory terms, and that do not  impose substantial costs on service providers or substantial burdens  on their systems or networks.    (vii)  Eligibility for the limitations in this subparagraph may not be conditioned  on the service provider monitoring its service, or affirmatively seeking facts  indicating infringing activity, except to the extent consistent with such  technical measures.    (viii) If the service provider qualifies for the limitations with respect to the function  referred to in clause (i)(A), court-ordered relief to compel or restrain certain  actions shall be limited to terminating specified accounts, or to taking  reasonable steps to block access to a specific, non-domestic on-line location.  If the service provider qualifies for the limitations with respect to any other  function in clause (i), court-ordered relief to compel or restrain certain actions  shall be limited to removing or disabling access to the infringing material,  terminating specified accounts, and other remedies that a court may find  necessary provided that such other remedies are the least burdensome to the  service provider among comparably effective forms of relief.  Each Party  shall provide that any such relief shall be issued with due regard for the  relative burden to the service provider and harm to the copyright owner, the  technical feasibility and effectiveness of the remedy and whether less  burdensome, comparably effective enforcement methods are available.   Except for orders ensuring the preservation of evidence, or other orders  having no material adverse effect on the operation of the service provider’s  communications network, each Party shall provide that such relief shall be  available only where the service provider has received notice and an  opportunity to appear before the Party’s judicial authority.    (ix)  For purposes of the notice and take down process for the functions referred to  in clauses (i)(C) and (D), each Party shall establish appropriate procedures  for effective notifications of claimed infringement, and effective counter- notifications by those whose material is removed or disabled through mistake  or misidentification.  At a minimum, each Party shall require that an effective  notification of claimed infringement be a written communication, physically  or electronically signed by a person who represents, under penalty of perjury  or other criminal penalty, that he is an authorized representative of a right  holder in the material that is claimed to have been infringed, and containing  information that is reasonably sufficient to enable the service provider to  identify and locate material that the complaining party claims in good faith to  be infringing and to contact that complaining party.  At a minimum, each  Party shall require that an effective counter-notification contain the same  information, mutatis mutandis, as a notification of claimed infringement, and  contain a statement that the subscriber making the counter-notification  consents to the jurisdiction of the courts of the Party.  Each Party shall also  provide for monetary remedies against any person who makes a knowing  material misrepresentation in a notification or counter-notification that causes  injury to any interested party as a result of a service provider relying on the  misrepresentation.     (x)  If the service provider removes or disables access to material in good faith  based on claimed or apparent infringement, each Party shall provide that the  service provider shall be exempted from liability for any resulting claims,  provided that, in the case of material residing on its system or network, it  takes reasonable steps promptly to notify the person making the material  available on its system or network that it has done so and, if such person  makes an effective counter-notification and is subject to jurisdiction in an  infringement suit, to restore the material on-line unless the person giving  the  original effective notification seeks judicial relief within a reasonable time.      (xi) Each Party shall establish an administrative or judicial procedure enabling  copyright owners who have given effective notification of claimed  infringement to obtain expeditiously from a service provider information in  its possession identifying the alleged infringer.  (xii)  Service provider means:    (A)  for purposes of the function referred to in clause (i)(A), a provider of  transmission, routing, or connections for digital on-line  communications without modification of their content between or  among points specified by the user of material of the user’s  choosing; and     (B)  for purposes of the functions referred to in clause (i)(B) through (D),   a provider or operator of facilities for on-line services or network   access.

      <article number="ARTICLE 16.1" name="Statement Of Shared Commitment" article_identifier="2972">1. The Parties reaffirm their obligations as members of the International Labor Organization (ILO) and their commitments under the ILO Declaration on Fundamental Principles and Rights at Work and its Follow-Up (1998) (ILO Declaration).
1
 Each Party shall strive to ensure that such labor principles and the internationally recognized labor rights set forth in Article 16.8 are recognized and protected by its law.  


2. The Parties affirm their full respect for their Constitutions.  Recognizing the right of each Party to establish its own domestic labor standards, and to adopt or modify accordingly its labor laws, each Party shall strive to ensure that its laws provide for labor standards consistent with the internationally recognized labor rights set forth in Article 16.8 and shall strive to improve those standards in that light.</article>
      <article number="ARTICLE 16.2" name="Enforcement Of Labor Laws" article_identifier="2973">1.  (a)  A Party shall not fail to effectively enforce its labor laws, through a sustained or recurring course of action or inaction, in a manner affecting trade between the Parties, after the date of entry into force of this Agreement.  (b)  Each Party retains the right to exercise discretion with respect to investigatory, prosecutorial, regulatory, and compliance matters and to make decisions regarding the allocation of resources to enforcement with respect to other labor matters determined to have higher priorities.  Accordingly, the Parties understand that a Party is in compliance with subparagraph (a) where a course of action or inaction reflects a reasonable exercise of such discretion, or results from a bona fide decision regarding the allocation of resources.  2. The Parties recognize that it is inappropriate to encourage trade or investment by weakening or reducing the protections afforded in domestic labor laws.  Accordingly, each Party shall strive to ensure that it does not waive or otherwise derogate from, or offer to waive or otherwise derogate from, such laws in a manner that weakens or reduces adherence to the internationally recognized labor rights referred to in Article 16.8 as an encouragement for trade with another Party, or as an encouragement for the establishment, acquisition, expansion, or retention of an investment in its territory.  3. Nothing in this Chapter shall be construed to empower a Party’s authorities to undertake labor law enforcement activities in the territory of another Party.</article>
      <article number="ARTICLE 16.3" name="Procedural Guarantees And Public Awareness" article_identifier="2974">1. Each Party shall ensure that persons with a legally recognized interest under its law in a particular matter have appropriate access to tribunals for the enforcement of the Party’s labor laws. Such tribunals may include administrative, quasi-judicial, judicial, or labor tribunals, as provided in the Party’s domestic law.  


2. Each Party shall ensure that proceedings before such tribunals for the enforcement of its labor laws are fair, equitable, and transparent and, to this end, each Party shall ensure that:  
 (a) such proceedings comply with due process of law;   (b)  any hearings in such proceedings are open to the public, except where the administration of justice otherwise requires;   (c)  the parties to such proceedings are entitled to support or defend their respective positions, including by presenting information or evidence; and   (d)  such proceedings do not entail unreasonable charges or time limits or unwarranted   delays.  3. Each Party shall provide that final decisions on the merits of the case in such proceedings are:  
(a) in writing and state the reasons on which the decisions are based;  


(b) made available without undue delay to the parties to the proceedings and, consistent with its law, to the public; and  


(c) based on information or evidence in respect of which the parties were offered the opportunity to be heard.  
4. Each Party shall provide, as appropriate, that parties to such proceedings have the right to seek review and, where warranted, correction of final decisions issued in such proceedings.  5. Each Party shall ensure that tribunals that conduct or review such proceedings are impartial and independent and do not have any substantial interest in the outcome of the matter.  6.

(b) have agreed on compensation or on a resolution pursuant to Article 20.15 and a complaining Party considers that the Party complained against has failed to observe the terms of the agreement,  
any such complaining Party may at any time thereafter provide written notice to the Party complained against that it intends to suspend the application to the Party complained against of benefits of equivalent effect. The notice shall specify the level of benefits that the Party proposes to suspend. Subject to paragraph 6, the complaining Party may begin suspending benefits 30 days after the later of the date on which it provides notice under this paragraph or the panel issues its determination under paragraph 3, as the case may be.  
3. If the Party complained against considers that:   


(a) the level of benefits proposed to be suspended is manifestly excessive; or  


(b) it has eliminated the non-conformity or the nullification or impairment that the panel has found,  
it may, within 30 days after the complaining Party provides notice under paragraph 2, request that the panel be reconvened to consider the matter.  The Party complained against shall deliver its request in writing to the complaining Party.  The panel shall reconvene as soon as possible after delivery of the request and shall present its determination to the disputing Parties within 90 days after it reconvenes to review a request under subparagraph (a) or (b), or within 120 days for a request under subparagraphs (a) and (b).  If the panel determines that the level of benefits proposed to be suspended is manifestly excessive, it shall determine the level of benefits it considers to be of equivalent effect.  
4. The complaining Party may suspend benefits up to the level the panel has determined under paragraph 3 or, if the panel has not determined the level, the level the complaining Party has proposed to suspend under paragraph 2, unless the panel has determined that the Party complained against has eliminated the non-conformity or the nullification or impairment.  


5. In considering what benefits to suspend pursuant to paragraph 2:  


(a) the complaining Party should first seek to suspend benefits in the same sector or sectors as that affected by the measure or other matter that the panel has found to be inconsistent with the obligations of this Agreement or to have caused nullification or impairment in the sense of Annex 20.2; and  


(b) if the complaining Party considers that it is not practicable or effective to suspend benefits in the same sector or sectors, it may suspend benefits in other sectors.  

6. The complaining Party may not suspend benefits if, within 30 days after it provides written notice of intent to suspend benefits or, if the panel is reconvened under paragraph 3, within 20 days after the panel provides its determination, the Party complained against provides written notice to the complaining Party that it will pay an annual monetary assessment.  The disputing Parties shall consult, beginning no later than ten days after the Party complained against provides notice, with a view to reaching agreement on the amount of the assessment.  If the disputing Parties are unable to reach an agreement within 30 days after consultations begin, the amount of the assessment shall be set at a level, in U.S. dollars, equal to 50 percent of the level of the benefits the panel has determined under paragraph 3 to be of equivalent effect or, if the panel has not determined the level, 50 percent of the level that the complaining Party has proposed to suspend under paragraph 2.  


7. Unless the Commission otherwise decides, a monetary assessment shall be paid to the complaining Party in U.S. dollars, or in an equivalent amount of the currency of the Party complained against, in equal, quarterly installments beginning 60 days after the Party complained against gives notice that it intends to pay an assessment.  Where the circumstances warrant, the Commission may decide that an assessment shall be paid into a fund established by the Commission and expended at the direction of the Commission for appropriate initiatives to facilitate trade between the disputing Parties, including by further reducing unreasonable trade barriers or by assisting a disputing Party in carrying out its obligations under this Agreement.

8. If the Party complained against fails to pay a monetary assessment, the complaining Party may suspend the application to the Party complained against of benefits in accordance with paragraph 4.  


9. This Article shall not apply with respect to a matter described in Article 20.17.1.</article>
      <article number="ARTICLE 20.17" name="Non-Implementation In Certain Disputes" article_identifier="3023">1. If, in its final report, a panel determines that a Party has not conformed with its obligations under Article 16.2.1(a) (Enforcement of Labor Laws) or Article 17.2.1(a) (Enforcement of Environmental Laws), and the disputing Parties:  


(a) are unable to reach agreement on a resolution pursuant to Article 20.15 within 45 days of receiving the final report; or  


(b) have agreed on a resolution pursuant to Article 20.15 and a complaining Party considers that the Party complained against has failed to observe the terms of the agreement,   
any such complaining Party may at any time thereafter request that the panel be reconvened to impose an annual monetary assessment on the Party complained against.  The complaining Party shall deliver its request in writing to the Party complained against. The panel shall reconvene as soon as possible after delivery of the request.  
2. The panel shall determine the amount of the monetary assessment in U.S. dollars within 90 days after it reconvenes under paragraph 1.  In determining the amount of the assessment, the panel shall take into account:  


(a) the bilateral trade effects of the Party’s failure to effectively enforce the relevant law;  


(b) the pervasiveness and duration of the Party’s failure to effectively enforce the relevant law;  


(c) the reasons for the Party’s failure to effectively enforce the relevant law, including, where relevant, its failure to observe the terms of an action plan;  


(d) the level of enforcement that could reasonably be expected of the Party given its resource constraints;  


(e) the efforts made by the Party to begin remedying the non-enforcement after the final report of the panel, including through the implementation of any mutually agreed action plan; and  


(f) any other relevant factors.  
 The amount of the assessment shall not exceed 15 million U.S. dollars annually, adjusted for inflation as specified in Annex 20.17.  
3. On the date on which the panel determines the amount of the monetary assessment under paragraph 2, or at any time thereafter, the complaining Party may provide notice in writing to the Party complained against demanding payment of the monetary assessment.  The monetary assessment shall be payable in U.S. dollars, or in an equivalent amount of the currency of the Party complained against, in equal, quarterly installments beginning 60 days after the complaining Party provides such notice.   


4. Assessments shall be paid into a fund established by the Commission and shall be expended at the direction of the Commission for appropriate labor or environmental initiatives, including efforts to improve or enhance labor or environmental law enforcement, as the case may be, in the territory of the Party complained against, consistent with its law. In deciding how to expend monies paid into the fund, the Commission shall consider the views of interested persons in the disputing Parties’ territories.

5. If the Party complained against fails to pay a monetary assessment, the complaining Party may take other appropriate steps to collect the assessment or otherwise secure compliance.  These steps may include suspending tariff benefits under the Agreement as necessary to collect the assessment, while bearing in mind the Agreement’s objective of eliminating barriers to trade and while seeking to avoid unduly affecting parties or interests not party to the dispute.</article>

Without prejudice to the procedures set out in Article 20.16.3, if the Party complained against considers that it has eliminated the non-conformity or the nullification or impairment that the panel has found, it may refer the matter to the panel by providing written notice to the complaining Party or Parties.  The panel shall issue its report on the matter within 90 days after the Party complained against provides notice.  


2. If the panel decides that the Party complained against has eliminated the non-conformity or the nullification or impairment, the complaining Party or Parties shall promptly reinstate any benefits that Party has or those Parties have suspended under Article 20.16 or Article 20.17 and the Party complained against shall no longer be required to pay any monetary assessment it has agreed to pay under Article 20.16.6 or that has been imposed on it under Article 20.17.1.</article>
