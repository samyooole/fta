        provide that an exporter or a producer calculates the regional
        value content of a good on the basis of the following

            promotion, marketing and after-sales service cost, royalty,
            shipping and packing cost, or non-allowable interest cost.

            accordance with the principles of the Customs Valuation
            Agreement in the same manner as an international
            transaction, with any modifications required by the
            circumstances.
          
      
      
        9. The value of an intermediate material is:

            (b) the sum of all costs that comprise the total cost
            incurred with respect to that intermediate material that can
            be reasonably allocated to that intermediate material.
          
      
      
        10. The value of an indirect material is based on the Generally
        Accepted Accounting Principles applicable in the territory of
        the Party in which the indirect material is used in the
        production, testing, or inspection of a good, or in the
        maintenance of buildings or the operation of equipment
        associated with the production of a good.</article>

        trade area or customs union with the same non-Party, as
        permitted by the WTO Agreement, the territory of that non-Party
        is deemed to form part of the territory of the free trade area
        established by this Agreement for the purposes of determining
        whether a good is originating under this Agreement.
      
        3. A Party shall give effect to paragraph 2 only once provisions
        with an effect equivalent to paragraph 2 are in force between
        each Party and the non-Party, and upon agreement by the Parties
        on whether to limit those provisions to specified goods or under

              originating;
            
        
            
              (b) a non-commercial importation of a good whose value
              does not exceed US$1,000 or its equivalent amount in the
              Party’s currency, or a higher amount that the Party
              establishes; or
            
        
            
              (c) an importation of a good for which the importing Party
              has waived the requirement for a Certificate of Origin,
            
        
            
              (d) provided that the importation is not part of a series
              of importations that may reasonably be considered to have
              been undertaken or arranged for the purposes of avoiding
              the certification requirements of Articles 5.2 and 5.3.</article>
      <article number="ARTICLE 5.5" name="Obligations Regarding Exportations" article_identifier="39180">1. Each Party shall provide that:
        
      
            
              (a) at the request of its customs administration, an
              exporter in its territory, or a producer in its territory
              that has provided a copy of a Certificate of Origin to
              that exporter pursuant to Article 5.2(3)(b)(iii), must
              provide a copy of the Certificate of Origin to the customs

              or a producer in its territory for a good to be exported
              to the territory of the other Party is subject to legal
              consequences of an equivalent effect, in accordance with
              the customs law of that Party, as would apply to an
              importer in its territory that makes a false statement or
              representation.
            
        
        
          2. A Party may apply a measure that the circumstances warrant
          if an exporter or a producer in its territory fails to comply
          with a requirement of this Chapter.
        
          3. A Party may not impose penalties on an exporter or a
          producer in its territory that voluntarily provides written
          notification pursuant to paragraph (1)(b) for an incorrect
          Certificate of Origin.</article>

          determining whether a good imported into its territory from
          the territory of the other Party qualifies as originating, a
          Party may, through its
          competent authority, conduct
          a verification by means of:
        
      
            
              (a) A written questionnaire to an exporter or a producer
              in the territory of the other Party;

              in the territory of the other Party to review the records
              referred to in Article 5.6(1) and to observe the

          2. Each Party shall allow an exporter or producer who receives
          a questionnaire pursuant to paragraph 1(a) at least 30 days,
          and no more than 60 days, from the date of receipt to return
          the completed questionnaire. On written request by the
          exporter or producer made during that period, the importing
          Party may grant the exporter or producer a single extension of
          the deadline of no more than:
        
      
            
              (a) 30 days; or

              out in the Uniform Regulations apply.
            
        
        
          3. If an exporter or producer fails to provide a properly
          completed questionnaire within the period or extension set out
          in paragraph 2, the importing Party may deny preferential
          tariff treatment to the good in question.
        
          4. Before conducting a verification visit under paragraph
          1(b), a Party shall, through its competent authority:
        
      
            
              (a) deliver a notification in writing of its intention to
              conduct the visit to:
            
          
                
                  (i) the exporter or producer whose premises are to be
                  visited,
                
            
                
                  (ii) the competent
                  authority of the
                  other Party, no less than 5 working days prior to
                  notifying the exporter or producer referred to in
                  sub-subparagraph (i), and
                
            
                
                  (iii) if requested by the Party in whose territory the
                  visit is to occur, the embassy of that Party in the
                  territory of the Party proposing to conduct the visit;
                  and
                
            
            
              obtain the written consent of the exporter or producer
              whose premises are to be visited.
            
        
        
          5. The notification
          referred to in paragraph 4 must include:
        
      
            
              (a) the identity of the competent authority issuing the
              notification;
            
        
            
              (b) the name of the exporter or producer whose premises
              are to be visited;
            
        
            
              (c) the date and place of the proposed verification visit;
            
        
            
              (d) the object and scope of the proposed verification
              visit, including specific reference to the good that is
              the subject of the verification;
            
        
            
              (d) the names and titles of the officials performing the
              verification visit; and
            
        
            
              (e) the legal authority for the verification visit.
            
        
        
          6. If an exporter or producer has not given its consent, in
          writing, to a proposed verification visit within 30 days of
          receipt of a notification under paragraph 4, the notifying
          Party may deny preferential tariff treatment to the good that
          was the subject of the visit.
        
          7. The Party whose competent authority receives a notification
          under paragraph 4 may,
          within 15 days of receipt of the notification, postpone the
          proposed verification visit for up to 60 days from the date of
          that receipt or for a longer period that the Parties may
          decide.
        
          8. Each Party shall allow an exporter or producer that
          receives notification under paragraph 4 to, on a single
          occasion within 15 days of receipt of the notification,
          request in writing that the postponement of the proposed
          verification visit for no more than:
        
      
            
              (a) 60 days from the date of that receipt, or
            
        
            
              (b) a longer period permitted by the notifying Party.
            
        
        
          9. A Party may not deny preferential tariff treatment to a
          good based only on the postponement of a verification visit
          under paragraphs 7 or 8.
        
          10. A Party shall permit an exporter or a producer of a good
          that is the subject of a verification visit by the other Party
          to designate 2 observers to be present during the visit,
          provided that:
        
      
            
              (a) the observers participate only as observers; and
            
        
            
              (b) the exporter or producer designate observers in time
              for the visit.
            
        
        
          11. When a Party conducts a verification of origin involving a
          regional value content, de
          minimis calculation or any other provision in
          Chapter Four (Rules of Origin) to which Generally Accepted
          Accounting Principles may be relevant, it shall apply those
          principles as they apply in the territory of the Party from
          which the good was exported.
        
          12. When a Party conducts a
          verification of origin, it shall, within 120 days after it
          receives the necessary information, provide the exporter or
          producer of the good that is the subject of the verification
          with a written determination of whether the good is
          originating, including findings of fact and the legal basis
          for the determination. A Party may extend that period by up to
          90 days by providing a notification of extension to the
          exporter or producer.
        
          13. If a verification by a Party indicates a pattern of
          conduct by an exporter or a producer of false or unsupported
          representations that a good imported into its territory
          qualifies as originating, the Party may withhold preferential
          tariff treatment to identical goods exported or produced by
          that person until that person establishes compliance with
          Chapter Four (Rules of Origin).
        
          14. Each Party shall provide that if it determines that a
          certain good imported into its territory does not qualify as
          an originating good based on a tariff classification or a
          value applied by the Party to a material used in the
          production of the good, which differs from the tariff
          classification or value applied to the material by the other
          Party, the Party’s determination does not become effective
          until it notifies in writing both the importer of the good and
          the person that completed and signed the Certificate of Origin
          for the good of its determination.
        
          15. A Party shall not apply
          a determination made under paragraph 14 to an importation made
          before the effective date of the determination if:
        
      
            
              (a) the competent authority of the other Party has issued
              an advance ruling under Article 5.10 or any other ruling
              on the tariff classification or on the value of that
              material, or has given consistent treatment to the entry
              of the material under the tariff classification or value
              at issue on which a person is entitled to rely; and
            
        
            
              (b) the advance ruling, other ruling or consistent
              treatment was given prior to notification of the
              determination.
            
        
        
          16. If a Party denies preferential tariff treatment to a good
          pursuant to a determination made under paragraph 14, it shall
          postpone the effective date of the denial for a period not
          exceeding 90 days if the importer of the good, or the person
          who completed and signed the Certificate of Origin for the
          good, demonstrates that it has relied in good faith to its
          detriment on the tariff classification or value applied to
          that material by the customs administration of the other
          Party.</article>
      <article number="ARTICLE 5.8" name="Confidentiality" article_identifier="39183">1. Each Party shall maintain, in accordance with its domestic
          law, the confidentiality of the information collected under

          to disclose the information, that Party shall notify the

              advance ruling; and
            
        
            
              (c) shall provide to the person requesting the ruling a
              full explanation of the reasons for the ruling.
            
        
        
          4. Subject to paragraph 6, each Party shall apply an advance
          ruling to importations into its territory of the good for
          which the ruling was requested, beginning either on the date
          of its issuance or a later date specified in the ruling.
        
          5. Each Party shall provide to a person requesting an advance
          ruling the same treatment, including the same interpretation
          and application of provisions of Chapter Four (Rules of
          Origin) regarding a determination of origin, as it provides to
          any other person to whom it issued an advance ruling, provided
          that the facts and circumstances are identical in all material
          respects.
        
          6. The issuing Party may modify or revoke an advance ruling:
        
      
            
              if the ruling is based on an error:
            
          
                
                  of fact,
                
            
                
                  in the tariff classification of a good or a material
                  that is the subject of the ruling,
                
            
                
                  in the application of a regional value content
                  requirement under Article 4.3 (Rules of Origin –
                  Regional Value Content), or
                
            
                
                  in the application of the rules for determining
                  whether a good that re-enters its territory after the
                  good has been exported from its territory to the
                  territory of the other Party for repair or alteration
                  qualifies for duty-free treatment under Article 3.8
                  (National Treatment and Market Access for Goods –
                  Goods Re-Entered after Repair or Alteration);
                
            
            
              (b) if the ruling is not in accordance with an
              interpretation decided on by the Parties under Article
              21.1(3)(a) (Institutional Arrangements and Dispute
              Settlement Procedures – Free Trade Commission) regarding
              Chapter Three (National Treatment and Market Access of
              Goods) or Chapter Four (Rules of Origin);
            
        
            
              (c) if there is a change in a material fact or
              circumstance on which the ruling is based;
            
        
            
              (d) to conform with an amendment to Chapter Three
              (National Treatment and Market Access of Goods), Chapter
              Four (Rules of Origin), this Chapter, or a modification to
              the Uniform Regulations; or
            
        
            
              (e) to conform with a judicial decision or a change in its
              domestic law.
            
        
        
          7. Each Party shall provide that a modification or revocation
          of an advance ruling:
        
      
            
              (a) is effective on the date on which the modification or
              revocation is issued, or on a later date specified in the
              ruling; and
            
        
            
              (b) may not be applied to a good imported before that
              date, unless the person to whom the advance ruling was
              issued has not acted in accordance with its terms and
              conditions.
            
        
        
          8. Notwithstanding paragraph 7, the issuing Party shall
          postpone the effective date of the modification or revocation
          for up to 90 days if the person to whom the advance ruling was
          issued demonstrates that it has relied in good faith on that
          ruling to that person’s detriment.
        
          9. Each Party shall provide that, if its competent authority
          examines the regional value content of a good for which it has
          issued an advance ruling pursuant to paragraph 1(b), (c), (d)
          or (e), the competent authority shall evaluate whether:
        
      
            
              (a) the exporter or producer has complied with the terms
              and conditions of the advance ruling;
            
        
            
              (b) the exporter’s or producer’s operations are consistent
              with the material facts and circumstances on which the
              advance ruling is based; and
            
        
            
              (c) the supporting data and computations used in applying
              the basis or method for calculating value or allocating
              cost were correct in all material respects.
            
        
        
          10. If a Party’s competent authority determines that a
          requirement in paragraph 9 has not been satisfied, the Party
          may modify or revoke the advance ruling if the circumstances
          warrant.
        
          11. Each Party shall provide that, if the person to whom an
          advance ruling was issued demonstrates that it used reasonable
          care and acted in good faith in presenting the facts and
          circumstances on which the ruling was based, and if the
          competent authority of a Party determines that the ruling was
          based on incorrect information, the person to whom the ruling
          was issued is not subject to penalties.
        
          12. If a Party issues an advance ruling to a person that has
          misrepresented or omitted the
          material facts or
          circumstances on which the ruling is based, or has failed to
          act in accordance with the terms and conditions of the ruling,
          the Party may apply the measures that are
          warranted by the
          circumstances, inaccordance with its domestic law.
        
          13. Each Party shall provide that an advance ruling will
          remain in effect and will be honoured if there is no change in
          the material facts or circumstances on which it is based.
        
          14. A Party may decline or postpone the issuance of an advance
          ruling if the application involves an issue that is the
          subject of:
        
      
            
              (a) a verification of origin;
            
        
            
              (b) a review by or appeal to the competent authority; or
            
        
            
              (c) judicial or quasi-judicial review in its territory.

        health-related or public safety requirements, a Party may
        require, before releasing the good, the submission of more
        extensive information, before or at the time of arrival of the
        good, to allow the competent authorities to examine the good for
        release.
      
        4. Each Party shall facilitate and simplify the process and
        procedures for the release of low-risk goods and improve
        controls on the release of high-risk goods. For these purposes,
        each Party shall base its examination, release, and post-entry
        verification procedures on risk assessment principles rather
        than on examinations of every shipment of goods entering its
        territory in a comprehensive manner for compliance with all
        import requirements. This paragraph does not prevent a Party
        from conducting quality control and compliance reviews, which
        may require more extensive examination.
      
        5. Each Party shall ensure that the procedures and activities of
        the competent authorities that maintain requirements on the
        import or export of goods are coordinated to facilitate trade.
        To this end, each Party shall take steps to harmonize the data
        requirements of the competent authorities with the objective of
        allowing importers and exporters to present all required data
        only once.
      
        6. In its procedures for the clearance of express consignments,
        each Party shall apply, to the extent possible, the World
        Customs Organization’s Guidelines for the Immediate
        Release of Consignments by Customs.
      
        7. Each Party shall introduce or maintain simplified clearance
        procedures for the entry of goods that:
      
    
          
            (a) are low in value; and
          
      
          
            (b) do not generate revenue that is considered significant
            by the Party maintaining the simplified clearance
            procedures.
          
      
      
        8. The Parties shall endeavour to both achieve common processes
        and to simplify the information necessary for the release of
        goods. To this end, the Parties shall, when appropriate, both
        apply existing international standards and establish a means of
        facilitating the electronic exchange of information between
        customs administrations, importers, exporters, and their agents
        or representatives, for the purpose of encouraging rapid release
        procedures.
      
        9. For the purposes of this Article, the Parties shall use
        formats based on international standards for the electronic
        exchange of information. In addition, the Parties shall take
        into account, to the extent possible, the World Customs
        Organization Recommendations “Concerning the Use of UN/EDIFACT
        Rules for Electronic Data Interchange” and “Concerning the Use
        of Codes for the Representation of Data Elements”. This
        paragraph does not preclude the use of additional electronic
        data transmission standards.
      
        10. The Parties, through their customs administrations, shall
        establish formal discussion mechanisms with their trade and
        business communities in order to promote greater cooperation and
        the exchange of electronic information.
      
        11. Upon written request, a Party shall, in accordance with
        Article 5.10 (Customs Procedures – Advance Rulings), issue a
        written ruling prior to importation pertaining to:
      
    
          
            (a) tariff classification;
          
      
          
            (b) the applicable rate of customs duty or any other tax
            applicable upon importation; or
          
      
          
            (c) whether a good is originating and is entitled to
            preferential tariff treatment under this Agreement.
          
      
      
        These requests may be made by an importer, exporter, or on their
        behalf by a representative.
      
        12. Each Party shall ensure that the rulings referred to in
        paragraph 11 are as detailed as both the nature of the request
        and the details provided by the person requesting the ruling
        permit.
      
        13. When a Party determines that a request for a ruling referred
        to in paragraph 11 is incomplete, it may request additional
        information including, if appropriate, a sample of the good or
        material in question from the person requesting the ruling.
      
        14. Rulings issued pursuant to paragraph 11 bind the customs
        administration of the Party that issued the ruling at the time
        that the goods that were the subject of the ruling are imported
        if the facts and circumstances that provided the basis of the
        ruling remain in effect.
      
        15. A Party may, at any time, without retroactive effect, modify
        or revoke a ruling issued pursuant to paragraph 11 after
        notifying the person that requested the ruling.
      
        16. If a ruling referred to in paragraph 11 is based on
        inaccurate or false information, the Party that issued the
        ruling may modify or revoke the ruling and, as appropriate and
        with prompt notification, may collect any uncollected duties,
        taxes, or other charges in accordance with its domestic law.
      
        17. Each Party shall ensure that an administrative action or
        official decision in respect of the import or export of a good
        is reviewable promptly by a judicial, arbitral, or
        administrative tribunal or procedure that:
      
    
          
            (a) is independent of the authority that issued the
            administrative action or official decision; and
          
      
          
            (b) has the authority to maintain, modify, or reverse the
            administrative action or official decision in accordance
            with the domestic law of the Party.
          
      
      
        18. Before requiring a person to seek redress at a judicial
        level, each Party shall provide for an administrative level of
        appeal or review that is independent of the official or office
        responsible for the administrative action or official decision
        that is being appealed.
      
        19. Each Party shall promptly make available the following
        requirements relating to imported and exported goods: laws,
        regulations, judicial decisions, administrative rulings, and
        policies of general application. Each Party shall also make
        available administrative notices regarding matters such as the
        following: general agency requirements, entry procedures, hours
        of operation, and points of contact for information enquiries.
      
        20. Each Party shall, in accordance with its domestic law, treat
        business information that is by its nature confidential or that
        is provided on a confidential basis as confidential.</article>
      <article number="ARTICLE 6.3" name="Cooperation" article_identifier="39192">1. The Parties recognize that technical cooperation is
        fundamental both to facilitating compliance with the obligations
        set forth in this Agreement and to reaching a better degree of
        trade facilitation.
      
        2. The Parties, through their customs administrations, shall
        develop a Technical Cooperation Program on customs-related
        matters on the basis of mutually decided terms relating to
        issues such as the scope, timing, and cost of cooperative
        measures. Customs related matters include:

        Agreement, an originating good is being imported into the
        Party’s territory in such increased quantities and under such
        conditions as to constitute a substantial cause of serious
        injury or threat of serious injury to a domestic industry.
      
        2. If the conditions set out in paragraphs 1, and 3 through 9
        are met, a Party may, to the extent necessary to remedy or
        prevent serious injury or threat of serious injury to a domestic
        industry:
      
    
          
            (a) suspend the further reduction of a rate of duty provided
            for under this Agreement on the good;
          
      
          
            (b) increase the rate of duty on the good to a level not
            exceeding the lesser of:
          
        
              
                (i) the most-favoured-nation (MFN) applied rate of duty
                in effect at the time the emergency action is taken, and
              
          
              
                (ii) the MFN applied rate of duty in effect on the day
                immediately preceding the date of entry into force of
                this Agreement; or
              
          
          
            (c) in the case of a duty applied to a good on a seasonal
            basis, increase the rate of duty to a level not exceeding
            the MFN applied rate of duty that was in effect on the good
            for the corresponding season immediately preceding the date
            of entry into force of this Agreement.
          
      
      
        3. A Party shall, in writing and without delay, notify the other
        Party and request discussions regarding the institution of a
        proceeding that could result in the application of an emergency
        action against an originating good.
      
        4. An emergency action shall be adopted no later than 1 year
        after the date the proceeding is instituted.
      
        5. A Party may not maintain an emergency action:
      
    
          
            (a) for a period exceeding 3 years; or
          
      
          
            (b) beyond the expiration of the transition period, unless
            the Party whose good is subject to the emergency action
            consents.
          
      
      
        6. During the transition period, a Party may not apply an
        emergency action to the same good more than twice.
      
        7. On the termination of a first emergency action, the rate of
        duty shall not exceed the rate that, according to the Party’s
        Schedule to Annex 3.4.1 (National Treatment and Market Access
        for Goods—Tariff Elimination) for the staged elimination of the
        tariff, would have been in effect 1 year after the adoption of
        the action. Beginning on January 1 of the year after the
        termination of the action, the Party that has taken the action
        shall:
      
    
          
            (a) set the rate of duty at the rate that would have been in
            effect, but for the emergency action, according to its
            Schedule to Annex 3.4.1 (National Treatment and Market
            Access for Goods—Tariff Elimination) for the staged
            elimination of the tariff; or
          
      
          
            (b) eliminate the tariff in equal annual stages ending on
            the date determined by Annex 3.4.1 (National Treatment and
            Market Access for Goods—Tariff Elimination) for the
            elimination of the tariff.
          
      
      
        8. A Party may apply a second emergency action to the same good
        provided that:
      
    
          
            (a) a period of time has elapsed since the termination of
            the first emergency action equal to at least one half the
            initial period of application;
          
      
          
            (b) the rate of duty for the first year of the second
            emergency action is not greater than the rate that would
            have been in effect under the Party’s Schedule to
            Annex 3.4.1 (National Treatment and Market Access for
            Goods—Tariff Elimination) at the time the first action was
            adopted; and
          
      
          
            (c) the rate of duty applicable to any subsequent year shall
            be reduced in equal increments such that the rate of duty in
            the final year of the emergency action is equal to the rate
            provided for in that Party’s Schedule to Annex 3.4.1
            (National Treatment and Market Access for Goods—Tariff
            Elimination) for that year.
          
      
      
        9. A Party may adopt a bilateral emergency action after the
        expiration of the transition period only with the consent of the
        other Party.
      
        10. A Party that applies an emergency action under this Article
        shall provide to the other Party mutually accepted trade
        liberalizing compensation in the form of concessions with
        substantially equivalent trade effects or with a value
        equivalent to the value of the additional duties expected to
        result from the action. If the Parties are unable to decide on
        compensation, the Party against whose good the action is taken
        may take tariff action with trade effects substantially
        equivalent to the emergency action taken under this Article. The
        Party taking the tariff action shall apply the action only for
        the period necessary to achieve the substantially equivalent
        effects.</article>

          territory.
        
          2. Each Party shall accord to an investment of an investor of
          the other Party in its territory treatment no less favourable
          than that it accords, in like circumstances, to investments of
          its own investors with respect to the establishment,
          acquisition, expansion, management, conduct, operation, and
          sale or other disposition of investments in its territory.
        
          3. The treatment accorded by a Party under paragraphs 1 and 2
          means, with respect to a sub-national government, treatment no
          less favourable than the most favourable treatment accorded,
          in like circumstances, by that sub-national government to
          investors, and to investments of investors, of the Party of

          2. A measure that requires an investment to use a technology
          to meet generally applicable health, safety, or environmental
          requirements is not inconsistent with paragraph 1(f). For
          greater certainty, Articles 10.4 and 10.5 apply to the

              (a) for a public purpose;

          2. The compensation referred to in paragraph 1(d) shall be
          equivalent to the fair market value of the expropriated
          investment immediately before the expropriation took place
          (“date of expropriation”), and shall not reflect any change in
          value that occurs as a result of prior knowledge of the
          intended expropriation. The valuation criteria includes going
          concern value, asset value (including declared tax value of
          tangible property), and other criteria, as appropriate, to
          determine fair market value.

          realizable and freely transferable. Compensation shall be

          the expropriating Party to a prompt review of its case and of
          the valuation of the investment by a judicial or other
          independent authority of that Party in accordance with the
          principles set out in this Article.
        
          5. This Article does not apply to a compulsory license granted
          in relation to intellectual property rights, or to the
          revocation, limitation, or creation of an intellectual
          property right, provided that the issuance, revocation,
          limitation or creation is consistent with the WTO Agreement.

          measure of general application is not be considered a measure
          equivalent to an expropriation of a debt security or loan
          covered by this Chapter solely on the ground that the measure
          imposes a cost on the debtor that causes the debtor to default
          on the debt.

          suffered by investments in its territory owing to armed
          conflict or civil strife.
        
          2. Paragraph 1 does not apply to an existing measure relating

          The Party shall protect any confidential information from
          disclosure that would prejudice the competitive position of
          the investor or the investment. This paragraph does not

          Party adopts or maintains measures with respect to the non
          Party that prohibit transactions with the enterprise or that

          derogate from, those measures to encourage the establishment,
          acquisition, expansion or retention in its territory of an
          investment of an investor. If a Party considers that the other
          Party has offered this encouragement, it may request
          discussions with the other Party and the two Parties shall
          enter into discussions with a view to avoiding any such

          or allow access to information which, if disclosed, would
          impede law enforcement or would be contrary to the Party’s
          domestic law protecting the deliberative and policy-making
          processes of the executive branch of government at the cabinet
          level, personal privacy or the financial affairs and accounts

          8. If a Tribunal’s confidentiality order designates
          information as confidential and a Party’s domestic law on
          access to information requires public access to that
          information, the Party’s domestic law on access to information
          prevails. However, a Party should endeavour to apply its
          domestic law on access to information to protect information
          that is designated confidential by the Tribunal.</article>

          4. In determining whether to grant leave to file a
          non-disputing party submission, the Tribunal shall consider,
          among other things, the extent to which:
        
      
            
              (a) the non-disputing party submission would assist the
              Tribunal in the determination of a factual or legal issue
              related to the arbitration by bringing a perspective,
              particular knowledge or insight that is different from
              that of the disputing parties;
            
        
            
              (b) the non-disputing party submission would address a

              (c) the non-disputing party has a significant interest in

              (d) there is a public interest in the subject-matter of
              the arbitration.
            
        
        
          5. The Tribunal shall ensure that:
        
      
            
              (a) a non-disputing party submission does not disrupt the
              proceedings; and
            
        
            
              (b) the submission does not unduly burden or unfairly
              prejudice either disputing party.
            
        
        
          6. The Tribunal shall decide whether to grant leave to file a
          non-disputing party submission. If leave to file a
          non-disputing party submission is granted, the Tribunal shall
          set an appropriate date for the disputing parties to respond
          in writing to the non-disputing party submission. By that
          date, the non-disputing Party may, pursuant to Article 10.31,
          address any issues raised in the non-disputing party
          submission regarding the interpretation of this Chapter.
        
          7. The Tribunal that grants leave to file a non-disputing
          party submission is not required to address the submission at
          any point in the arbitration, and the non-disputing party that
          files the submission is not entitled to make further
          submissions in the arbitration.
        
          8. The provisions pertaining to public access to hearings and

              (b) a recommendation that the Party abide by or comply
              with the final award.

          award under the ICSID Convention, the New York Convention or
          the Inter-American Convention, regardless of whether
          proceedings are taken under paragraph 5.

        or experience obtained, requirements met, or licenses or
        certifications granted in a particular country. That
        recognition, which may be achieved through harmonization or
        otherwise, may be based on an agreement or arrangement with the
        country concerned or may be accorded autonomously.
      
        2. A Party that is a party to an agreement or arrangement of the
        type referred to in paragraph 1 shall afford to the other Party,
        if the other Party is interested, adequate opportunity to
        negotiate its accession to that agreement or arrangement or to

        education, experience, licences or certifications obtained or
        requirements met in that other Party’s territory should be
        recognized.
      
        3. A Party may not accord recognition in a manner that would

        on trade in services.

            agreement or arrangement.

        shall be determined by the Parties within 1 year following the
        entry into force of this Agreement.
      
        6. On receipt of a notification referred to in subparagraph
        4(c), the Commission shall review the agreement or arrangement
        within a reasonable time to determine whether it is consistent
        with this Agreement. Based on the Commission’s review, each
        Party shall ensure that its competent authorities, if
        appropriate, implement the agreement or arrangement within a

        5. This Chapter does not prevent a Party, including its public
        entities, from exclusively conducting or providing in its
        territory:
      
    
          
            (a) an activity or service forming part of a public
            retirement plan or statutory system of social security; or
          
      
          
            (b) an activity or service for the account, with the
            guarantee or using the financial resources of the Party,
            including its public entities.</article>
      <article number="ARTICLE 13.3" name="National Treatment" article_identifier="39276">1.  Each Party shall accord to an investor of the other Party
        treatment no less favourable than that it accords to its own
        investors, in like circumstances, with respect to the
        establishment, acquisition, expansion, management, conduct,
        operation, and sale or other disposition of a financial
        institution or an investment in a financial institution in its
        territory.
      
        2.  Each Party shall accord to a financial institution of the
        other Party and to an investment of an investor of the other
        Party in a financial institution treatment no less favourable
        than that it accords to its own financial institutions and to
        investments of its own investors in financial institutions, in
        like circumstances, with respect to the establishment,
        acquisition, expansion, management, conduct, operation, and sale
        or other disposition of a financial institution or investment.
      
        3.  For the purposes of national treatment obligations in
        Article 13.6(1), a Party shall accord to a cross-border
        financial service provider of the other Party treatment no less
        favourable than that it accords to its own financial service
        providers, in like circumstances, with respect to the provision
        of the relevant service.
      
        4. The treatment that a Party is required to accord under
        paragraphs 1, 2 and 3 means, with respect to a measure adopted
        or maintained by a sub-national government, treatment no less
        favourable than the most favourable treatment accorded, in like
        circumstances, by that sub-national government to an investor in
        a financial institution, a financial institution, an investment
        of an investor in a financial institution and a financial
        service provider of the Party of which it forms a part.
      
        5. Differences in market share, profitability, or size do not in
        themselves establish a breach of the obligations under this
        Article.</article>
      <article number="ARTICLE 13.4" name="Most-Favoured-Nation Treatment" article_identifier="39277">1. Each Party shall accord to an investor of the other Party, a
        financial institution of the other Party, an investment of an
        investor in a financial institution, and a cross-border
        financial service provider of the other Party, treatment no less
        favourable than that it accords to an investor, financial
        institution, investment of an investor in a financial
        institution, and a cross-border financial service provider of a
        non-Party, in like circumstances.
      
        2.  A Party may recognize a prudential measure of a non-Party
        when the Party applies a measure covered by this Chapter. That
        recognition may be:
      
    
          
            (a) accorded unilaterally;
          
      
          
            (b) achieved through harmonization or other means; or
          
      
          
            (c) based on an agreement or arrangement with the non-Party.
          
      
      
        3. A Party that recognizes a prudential measure under paragraph
        2 shall provide adequate opportunity to the other Party to
        demonstrate that circumstances exist in which there are or would
        be equivalent regulation, oversight, implementation of
        regulation, and if appropriate, procedures concerning the
        sharing of information between the Parties.
      
        4. If a Party recognizes a prudential measure under subparagraph
        2(c) and the circumstances set out in paragraph 3 exist, the
        Party shall provide adequate opportunity for the other Party to
        negotiate accession to the agreement or arrangement, or to
        negotiate a comparable agreement or arrangement.</article>
      <article number="ARTICLE 13.5" name="Right Of Establishment" article_identifier="39278">1. A Party shall permit an investor of the other Party that does
        not own or control a financial institution in the Party’s
        territory to establish, without imposing a numerical restriction
        or a requirement to take a specific juridical form, a financial
        institution that is permitted to provide a financial service
        that a like institution of the Party may provide under the
        domestic law of the Party at the time of establishment. The
        obligation not to impose a requirement to take a specific
        juridical form does not prevent a Party from imposing a
        condition or a requirement in connection with the establishment
        of a particular type of entity chosen by an investor of the
        other Party.
      
        2. A Party shall permit an investor of the other Party that owns
        or controls a financial institution in the Party’s territory to
        establish in that territory such additional financial
        institutions as may be necessary to provide the full range of
        financial services allowed under the domestic law of the Party
        when the additional financial institutions are established.
        Subject to Article 13.3, a Party may impose a term or condition
        on the establishment of additional financial institutions and
        determine the institutional and juridical form to be used to
        provide a specified financial service or to carry out a
        specified activity.
      
        3. The right of establishment under paragraphs 1 and 2 includes
        the right to acquire an existing entity.
      
        4. Subject to Article 13.3, a Party may prohibit a particular
        financial service or activity but may not prohibit all financial
        services or a complete financial service subsector, such as
        banking.
      
        5. For the purposes of this Article, without prejudice to other
        measures taken for prudential reasons, a Party may require that
        an investor of the other Party be engaged in the business of
        providing a financial service in the territory of that other
        Party.
      
        6. For the purposes of this Article, “a numerical restriction”
        means a limitation that is imposed on the number of financial
        institutions either on the basis of a regional subdivision, or
        on the basis of the entire territory of a Party, whether that
        limitation is in the form of a numerical quota, a monopoly, an
        exclusive service provider or the requirements of an economic
        needs test.</article>
      <article number="ARTICLE 13.6" name="Cross-Border Trade" article_identifier="39279">1. Each Party shall permit, under terms and conditions that
        accord national treatment, a cross-border financial service
        provider of the other Party to provide a financial service
        specified in Annex 13.6.
      
        2.  Each Party shall permit a person located in its territory,
        and its nationals, wherever they are located, to purchase a
        financial service from a cross-border financial service provider
        of the other Party located in the territory of that other Party.
        This obligation does not require a Party to permit such a
        provider to do business or solicit in its territory. Subject to
        paragraph 1, each Party may define “doing business” and
        “solicitation” for the purposes of this obligation.
      
        3.  Without prejudice to other measures taken for prudential
        reasons of cross-border trade in financial services, a Party may
        require the registration of a cross-border financial service
        provider of the other Party and of financial instruments.</article>
      <article number="ARTICLE 13.7" name="New Financial Services" article_identifier="39280">1.   A Party shall permit a financial institution of the other
        Party to provide a new financial service that the first Party
        would permit its own financial institutions, in like
        circumstances, to provide under its domestic law. A Party may:
      
    
          
            (a) require the financial institution to request permission
            or notify the relevant regulator in order to obtain that
            permission; and
          
      
          
            (b) refuse to grant permission if the introductionof the
            financial service would require the Party to adopt or amend
            a statute.
          
      
      
        2. A Party may determine the institutional and juridical form
        through which the new financial service may be provided and may
        require authorization for the provision of the service. If a
        Party would permit the new financial service, and authorization
        is required, the decision shall be made within a reasonable time
        and authorization may only be refused for prudential reasons.
      
        3. This Article does not prevent a financial institution of a
        Party from applying to the other Party to consider authorizing
        the provision of a financial service that is not provided within
        either Party’s territory. That application is subject to the
        domestic law of the Party to which the application is made and,
        for greater certainty, is not subject to the obligations of this
        Article.</article>
      <article number="ARTICLE 13.8" name="Senior Management And Boards Of Directors" article_identifier="39281">1. A Party may not require a financial institution of the other
        Party to engage natural persons of a particular nationality as
        senior managerial or other essential personnel.
      
        2. A Party may not require that more than a simple majority of
        the board of directors of a financial institution of the other
        Party be composed of nationals of the Party or natural persons
        residing in the territory of the Party.</article>

            (a) the protection of investors, depositors, financial

        (Cross-Border Trade in Services), Chapter Twelve
        (Telecommunications), Chapter Fourteen (Temporary Entry for
        Business Persons), Chapter Fifteen (Competition Policy,

        measure of general application taken by a public entity in
        pursuit of a monetary and related credit policy or an exchange
        rate policy. This paragraph does not affect a Party’s
        obligations under Article 10.7 (Investment – Performance
        Requirements) with respect to measures covered by Chapter Ten
        (Investment) or Article 10.10 (Investment – Transfers).
      
        3.  Notwithstanding Article 10.10 (Investment – Transfers), as
        incorporated into this Chapter, a Party may prevent or limit
        transfers by a financial institution or a cross-border financial
        services provider to, or for the benefit of, an affiliate of or
        person related to that institution or provider, through the
        equitable, non-discriminatory and good faith application of
        measures relating to maintenance of the safety, soundness,
        integrity or financial responsibility of financial institutions
        or cross-border financial service providers. This paragraph does
        not prejudice any other provision of this Agreement that permits
        a Party to restrict transfers.
      
        4.  Article 13.3 does not apply if a Party grants to a financial
        institution an exclusive right to provide a financial service
        referred to in Article 13.2(5)(a).
      
        5. A Party may adopt or enforce a measure necessary to secure
        compliance with its laws or regulations that is consistent with
        this Chapter, including a measure relating to the prevention of
        deceptive and fraudulent practices or to deal with the effects
        of a default on financial services contracts. A Party may not
        apply that measure in a manner that would constitute a means of
        arbitrary or unjustifiable discrimination between countries
        where like conditions prevail, or a disguised restriction on
        investment in a financial institution or on a cross-border trade
        in financial services.</article>

        regulatory authority, shall inform the applicant of the status

        it is not practicable for a decision to be made within 120 days,
        the Party, through its regulatory authority, shall notify the
        applicant without undue delay and shall endeavour to make the
        decision within a reasonable period of time.

        5. Nothing in this Chapter prevents a Party from developing new
        procurement policies, procedures or contractual means, provided

    Valuation
        
          6. In estimating the value of a procurement in order to
          ascertain whether it is a procurement covered by this Chapter,

              (a) not divide a procurement into separate procurements or
              select or use a particular valuation method for estimating
              the value of a procurement with the intention of totally
              or partially excluding it from the application of this
              Chapter;
            
        
            
              (b) include the estimated maximum total value of the

              one or more suppliers, taking into account all forms of
              remuneration, including:
            
          
                
                  (i) premiums, fees, commissions, and interest, and
                
            
                
                  (ii) the estimated maximum total value of the
                  procurement, inclusive of optional purchases, if the
                  procurement provides for the possibility of an options
                  clause; and
                
            
            
              (c) base its calculation of the total maximum value of the
              procurement over its entire duration, if the procurement
              is to be conducted in multiple parts with contracts to be
              awarded at the same time or over a given period to one or
              more suppliers.</article>
      <article number="ARTICLE 17.3" name="Security And General Exceptions" article_identifier="39309">1. This Chapter does not prevent a Party from taking an action
        or not disclosing information that it considers necessary for
        the protection of its essential security interests relating to
        procurement:
      
    
          
            (a) of arms, ammunition or war materials;

            (c) for national defence purposes.
          
      
      
        2. Provided that a measure is not applied in a manner that would
        constitute a means of arbitrary or unjustifiable discrimination
        against a Party if the same conditions prevail, or a disguised
        restriction on trade between the Parties, a Party may adopt or
        maintain a measure:
      
    
          
            (a) necessary to protect public morals, order or safety;

            (d) relating to a good or service of a person with a
            disability, a philanthropic institution or prison labour.</article>

          a good or service of the other Party, and to a supplier of the
          other Party of that good or service, treatment no less
          favourable than the most favourable treatment the Party or
          entity accords to a domestic good, service or supplier.
        
          2. With respect to a measure regarding a covered procurement,
          a Party, including its procuring entities, may not:
        
      
            
              (a) treat a locally established supplier less favourably
              than another locally established supplier on the basis of
              degree of foreign affiliation or ownership; or
            
        
            
              (b) discriminate against a locally established supplier on
              the basis that the good or service offered by that
              supplier for a particular procurement is a good or service
              of the other Party.
            
        Rules of Origin
        
          3. With regard to the procurement of a good covered by this
          Chapter, each Party shall apply the rules of origin that it
          applies to that good in the normal course of trade.
        
    Offsets
        
          4. Subject to this Chapter, a Party, including its procuring
          entities, shall not seek, take account of, or impose offsets
          at a stage of a procurement process.

          publish, as early as possible in each fiscal year, a notice
          regarding that procuring entity’s future procurement plans.</article>
      <article number="ARTICLE 17.7" name="Conditions For Participation" article_identifier="39313">1. If a procuring entity requires a supplier to satisfy a
        registration, qualification, or other requirement or condition
        for participation in order to participate in a procurement
        process, the procuring entity shall publish a notice inviting
        suppliers to apply for registration, qualification or
        demonstration of suppliers’ satisfaction of any other conditions
        for participation. The procuring entity shall publish the notice
        sufficiently in advance to provide interested suppliers
        sufficient time to prepare and submit applications and to
        provide the procuring entity with sufficient time to evaluate
        and make its determinations based on those applications. The
        procuring entity may establish a final date for the submission
        of requests for participation, provided that date allows
        suppliers a reasonable time to prepare and submit such requests,
        taking into account the nature and complexity of the
        procurement.
      
        2. In establishing the conditions for participation, a procuring
        entity shall:
      
    
          
            (a) limit the conditions for participation in a covered
            procurement to those that are essential to ensure that the
            supplier has the legal and financial capacity and the
            technical ability to fulfill the requirements and technical
            specifications of the procurement;
          
      
          
            (b) refrain from imposing the condition that, in order for a
            supplier to participate in a procurement process, the
            supplier has:
          
        
              
                (i) previously been awarded a contract by a procuring
                entity of a Party, or
              
          
              
                (ii) prior experience in the territory of that Party.
              
          
      
        3. To assess whether a supplier satisfies the conditions for
        participation, a procuring entity shall:
      
    
          
            (a) evaluate the financial capacity and technical ability of
            a supplier on the basis of that supplier’s business activity
            inside and outside the territory of the Party of the
            procuring entity;
          
      
          
            (b) recognize as qualified the suppliers of the other Party
            that satisfy the conditions for participation; and
          
      
          
            (c) base its evaluation solely on the conditions for
            participation that the procuring entity has specified in
            advance in its notices or tender documentation.
          
      List of Suppliers
        
          4. A procuring entity may establish or maintain a publicly
          available list of suppliers qualified to participate in a
          procurement process. If a procuring entity requires a supplier
          to qualify for a list as a condition for participation in a
          procurement process, and a supplier that has not yet qualified
          applies for inclusion in the list, the procuring entity shall
          promptly start the qualification procedures and shall allow
          the supplier to submit a tender, if it is determined to be a
          qualifying supplier, provided there is sufficient time to
          fulfill the conditions for participation within the time
          period established for tendering.
        
    Information on Procuring Entity Decisions
        
          5. A procuring entity shall promptly inform a supplier that
          applies for participation in a procurement process or for
          inclusion on a list of suppliers of the procuring entity’s
          decision with respect to the application.
        
          6. If a procuring entity:
        
      
            
              (a) rejects a supplier’s application for participation in
              a procurement process or an application for inclusion on a
              list of suppliers; or
            
        
            
              (b) ceases to recognize a supplier as qualified,
            
        
        
          the procuring entity shall promptly inform the supplier of its
          decision and, at the request of the supplier, promptly provide
          the supplier with a written explanation of the reasons for its
          decision.
        
          7. A procuring entity may exclude a supplier from a
          procurement process on grounds such as bankruptcy or false
          declarations.</article>
      <article number="ARTICLE 17.8" name="Technical Specifications" article_identifier="39314">1. A procuring entity may not prepare, adopt or apply a
        technical specification with the purpose or the effect of
        creating an unnecessary obstacle to trade between the Parties.
      
        2. In prescribing a technical specification for a good or
        service being procured, a procuring entity, shall, if
        appropriate:
      
    
          
            (a) specify the technical specification in terms of a
            performance requirement rather than a design or descriptive
            characteristic; and
          
      
          
            (b) base the technical specification on an international
            standard, if one exists; otherwise, base the technical
            specification on a national technical regulation, recognized
            national standard or building code.
          
      
      
        3. A procuring entity shall not prescribe a technical
        specification requiring or referring to a particular trademark
        or trade name, patent, design, type, specific origin, or
        producer or supplier, unless there is no other sufficiently
        precise or intelligible way of describing the procurement
        requirement, provided that, in those cases, the procuring entity
        includes words such as “or equivalent” in the tender
        documentation.
      
        4. A procuring entity shall not seek or accept, in a manner that
        would have the effect of precluding competition, advice that may
        be used to prepare or adopt a technical specification for a
        specific procurement from a person that may have a commercial
        interest in that procurement.
      
        5. For greater certainty, this Article does not preclude a
        procuring entity from preparing, adopting, or applying a
        technical specification to promote the conservation of natural
        resources.</article>
      <article number="ARTICLE 17.9" name="Tender Documentation" article_identifier="39315">1. A procuring entity shall make available to interested
        suppliers tender documentation that includes the information
        necessary for a supplier to prepare and submit a responsive
        tender. The documentation shall include the evaluation criteria
        that the procuring entity intends to use to award the contract,
        including the cost factors and the weights or, if appropriate,
        the relative values, that the procuring entity will assign to
        the criteria in evaluating tenders.
      
        2. A procuring entity may make available the tender
        documentation required by paragraph 1 by publishing that
        documentation by electronic means accessible to interested
        suppliers. If a procuring entity does not publish tender
        documentation by electronic means accessible to interested
        suppliers, it shall promptly make the documentation available at
        the request of a supplier.
      
    Modifications
        
          3. If, in the course of a procurement process, a procuring
          entity modifies the criteria referred to in paragraph 1, it
          shall transmit the amended tender documentation in writing:
        
      
            
              (a) to all suppliers that are participating in the
              procurement process at the time the criteria are modified,
              if the procuring entity knows the identities of those
              suppliers, and in all other cases, in the same manner as
              the original documentation was made available; and
            
        
            
              (b) in adequate time to allow those suppliers to modify or
              submit amended tenders, as appropriate.</article>
      <article number="ARTICLE 17.10" name="Time Limits For The Submission Of Tenders" article_identifier="39316">1. A procuring entity shall provide suppliers sufficient time to
        submit applications to participate in a procurement and to

        nature and complexity of the procurement.
      
    Deadlines
        
          2. Except as provided for in paragraphs 3 and 4, a procuring
          entity shall establish that the final date for the submission
          of tenders is not less than 40 days from the date on which the
          notice of intended procurement is published.
        
          3.  If domestic law allows, a procuring entity may reduce by 5
          days the time limit established under paragraph 2 for the
          submission of tenders, for each one of the following
          circumstances:

              limits for the submission of tenders or, if applicable,
              conditions for participation in a procurement process, and
              the address from which documents relating to the

      <article number="ARTICLE 17.11" name="Limited Tendering" article_identifier="39317">1. Subject to paragraph 2, a procuring entity shall award a
        contract by means of open tendering procedures.
      
        2. Provided that a procuring entity does not use this paragraph
        to avoid competition among suppliers or to protect domestic
        suppliers, the procuring entity may award a contract by limited
        tendering or other equivalent tendering procedures if:

            a particular supplier and a reasonable alternative or

            good or service that are intended either as replacement
            parts, extensions, or continuing services for existing
            equipment, software, services or installations, a change of
            supplier would compel the procuring entity to procure a good
            or service not meeting requirements of interchangeability
            with existing equipment, software, services, or
            installations procured under the initial procurement;

            of, and for, a particular contract for research, experiment,
            study or original development;
          
      
          
            (f) an additional construction service that was not included
            in the initial contract but that is within the objectives of
            the original tender documentation has become necessary, due
            to unforeseeable circumstances, to complete the construction
            service described in the original tender documentation.
            However, the total value of the contracts awarded for
            additional construction services may not exceed 50% of the
            total amount of the initial contract;
          
      
          
            (g) to the extent that it is strictly necessary, for reasons
            of urgency brought about by events unforeseeable by the
            procuring entity, the good or service cannot be obtained in
            time using an open tendering procedure;
          
      
          
            (h) a contract is awarded to a winner of an architectural
            design contest, provided that:

            (i) a procuring entity needs to procure a consulting service
            regarding matters of a confidential nature, the disclosure
            of which can reasonably be expected to compromise government
            confidences, cause economic disruption or otherwise be
            contrary to the public interest.
          
      
      
        3. A procuring entity shall maintain a record or prepare a
        written report for each contract awarded under paragraph 2 in a
        manner consistent with Article 17.13(3). The record or report

        2. Unless a procuring entity determines that it is not in the
        public interest to award a contract, it shall award the contract
        to the supplier that the procuring entity determines is fully
        able to undertake the contract and, based on the requirements
        and evaluation criteria set out in the tender documentation,
        submits the most advantageous tender.</article>

        authorization of the person that provided the information to the
        Party.
      
        2. A Party, including its procuring entities, is not required
        under this Chapter to release confidential information if the
        release:

            (a) receive and review a challenge submitted by a supplier
            relating to the obligations of this Chapter; and
          
      
          
            (b) make appropriate findings and recommendations.

        designates under paragraph 1 provides a supplier with:
      
    
          
            (a) sufficient time to prepare and submit a written
            challenge, which may not be less than 10 days from the time
            when the basis of the complaint became known or reasonably

        designates under paragraph 1 may take a prompt interim measure
        to preserve the supplier’s opportunity to participate in the
        procurement process, including the suspension of the procurement
        process. The procedures for taking an interim measure may
        provide that overriding adverse consequences for the interests
        concerned, including the public interest, may be taken into
        account when deciding whether an interim measure should be
        applied.
      
        4. Each Party shall ensure that its review procedures are made
        generally available in writing and that those procedures are
        timely, transparent, effective, and consistent with the
        principle of due process.

        challenge.

        reviewed in a manner that does not prejudice that supplier’s
        participation in an ongoing or future procurement process.
      
        8. If a body other than an authority established or designated
        under paragraph 1 initially reviews a supplier’s challenge, the

        2(a), or does not accept the compensatory adjustment offered
        under paragraph 2(b), then the change to coverage proposed by
        the other Party under that paragraph does not take effect.</article>

              decided on by both Parties, failing which the replacement
              shall be appointed in accordance with the second sentence
              of paragraph 3; or

              further 30 days, and the Parties shall select a panel

          the Code of Conduct, the Parties shall consult and if they so
          decide, may dismiss the panel member and select a new panel
          member in accordance with this Article.</article>

              report, if the panel determines that all measures at issue
              are not inconsistent with the obligations of this
              Agreement and do not cause nullification or impairment in
              the sense of Annex 21.6; or

              complaining Party of any measure determined to be
              inconsistent with the obligations of the Agreement or to
              have caused nullification or impairment in the sense of
              Annex 21.6; and

          8. The panel may not disclose which panel members are
          associated with a majority or minority opinion in its
          preliminary report or its final report.
        
          9. Unless the Parties decide otherwise, the final report of
          the panel may be published by a Party or the Secretariat 15
          days after it is presented to the Parties, subject to
          Article 21.13(2)(f).</article>
      <article number="ARTICLE 21.17" name="Implementation Of The Final Report" article_identifier="39357">1. A Party shall promptly implement the panel’s final report
          to ensure effective dispute resolution.
        
          2. On receipt of the final report, the Parties shall endeavour
          to come to a resolution of the dispute taking into account the
          determinations and any recommendations of the panel. The
          Parties shall notify their respective sections of the
          Secretariat of any resolution of the dispute.
        
          3. Whenever possible, the resolution shall be the
          non-implementation or removal of a measure not conforming to
          this Agreement, or failing such a resolution, compensation.
        
          4. If a panel determines that a measure nullifies or impairs
          benefits in the sense of Annex 21.6, the Party complained
          against is not obliged to withdraw the measure. In such a
          case, notwithstanding Article 21.18(1), compensation may be
          of the dispute.</article>
      <article number="ARTICLE 21.18" name="Compensation And Suspension Of Benefits" article_identifier="39358">1. The Parties recognize that compensation, suspension of
          benefits, and suspension of other obligations are temporary
          measures and that the non-implementation or removal of a
          measure not complying with this Agreement is preferable to
          compensation and to suspension of benefits or other
          obligations. A Party has the discretion to decide whether or
          not to compensate the other Party. If it does decide to
          compensate the other Party, the compensation shall be
          consistent with the obligations of this Agreement.
        
          2. If the final report includes a determination that a measure
          is inconsistent with the obligations of this Agreement or
          causes nullification or impairment in the sense of Annex 21.6,
          the complaining Party may, after receiving the final report,
          request specific compensation from the Party complained
          against that the complaining Party considers would constitute
          a satisfactory resolution of the dispute. The Party complained
          against shall give sympathetic consideration to any such
          request.
        
          3. If the Parties do not reach a mutually satisfactory
          resolution of the dispute within 30 days of the expiry of the
          period of time for implementation of the final report, the
          complaining Party may suspend benefits or other obligations
          equivalent to the degree of adverse trade effects until:
        
      
            
              (a) the Parties have reached a mutually satisfactory
              resolution of the dispute; or
            
        
            
              (b) the Party complained against has removed the measure
              inconsistent with the Agreement.
            
        
        
          4. The complaining Party may not suspend benefits or other
          obligations until 10 days after it has delivered to the Party
          complained against notice, in writing, identifying the
          benefits or other obligations that it intends to suspend.
        
          5. In considering which benefits to suspend pursuant to
          paragraph 3:
        
      
            
              (a) the complaining Party should first seek to suspend
              benefits or other obligations in the same sector or
              sectors as that or those affected by the measure or other
              matter that the panel has found to be inconsistent with
              the obligations of this Agreement or to have caused
              nullification or impairment in the sense of Annex 21.6;
              and
            
        
            
              (b) the complaining Party that does not consider it
              practicable or effective to suspend benefits or other
              obligations in the same sector or sectors may suspend
              benefits in other sectors.
            
        
        
          6. A Party may, by notice in writing delivered to its Section
          of the Secretariat and to the other Party, request the
          establishment of a compliance panel:
        
      
            
              (a) to determine whether the level of benefits or other
              obligations suspended by the complaining Party pursuant to
              paragraph 3 is excessive; or
            
        
            
              (b) to rule on any disagreement regarding the
              non-implementation or removal of a measure determined by
              the previous panel to be inconsistent with the Agreement.
            
        
        
          7. The compliance panel shall consist of the members of the
          original panel. If a member of the original panel is unable to
          serve on the panel, that panel member shall be replaced under
          the provisions of Article 21.11(4).
        
          8. The compliance panel is deemed to have been established on
          the date that the request for the establishment of the
          compliance panel is received by the other Party.
        
          9. The compliance panel proceedings shall be conducted in

        Parties at the time that the investor gives notice under Article
        10.21 (Investment – Notice of Intent to Submit a Claim to

            decision shall bind a panel established under Article 21.11
            (Institutional Arrangements and Dispute Settlement

            If an issue arises as to whether a measure of a Party is a
            taxation measure in connection with a claim by an investor
            of a Party, the Party that has received notice of intention
            to submit a claim to arbitration or against which an
            investor of the other Party has submitted a claim may refer
            the issue to the designated authorities the Parties. The
            designated authorities shall decide whether the measure is a
            taxation measure, and their decision shall bind a Tribunal
            with jurisdiction over the claim. A Tribunal seized of a
            claim in which the same issue arises may not proceed while
            the designated authorities are considering the issue. If a
            Party has referred the issue to the designated authorities
            and they have not decided the issue within 6 months of the
            referral, the Tribunal shall decide the issue.
          
      
          
            If an issue arises as to whether a tax convention prevails
            over this Agreement in a dispute between the Parties, a
            Party may refer the issue to the designated authorities of
            the Parties. The designated authorities shall consider the
            issue and decide whether the tax convention prevails. If
            within 6 months of the referral of the issue to the
            designated authorities, they decide with respect to the
            measure that gives rise to the issue that the tax convention
            prevails, procedures concerning that measure may not be
            initiated under Article 21.10 (Institutional Arrangements
            and Dispute Settlement Procedures – Establishment of a
            Panel). Procedures concerning the measure may not be
            initiated while the designated authorities are considering
            the issue. If a Party has referred the issue to the
            designated authorities and they have not decided the issue
            within 6 months of the referral, the panel shall decide the
            issue.
          
      
          
            If an issue arises as to whether a tax convention prevails
            over this Agreement prior to the submission of a claim by an
            investor of a Party, the Party that has received notice of
            intention to submit a claim to arbitration may refer the
            issue to the designated authorities of the Parties. The
            designated authorities shall consider the issue and decide
            whether the tax convention prevails. If within 6 months of
            the referral of the issue to the designated authorities,
            they decide with respect to the measure that gives rise to
            the issue that the tax convention prevails, a claim
            concerning that measure may not be submitted under Article
            10.23 (Investment – Submission of a Claim to Arbitration). A
            claim concerning the measure may not be submitted while the
            designated authorities are considering the issue. An
            investor of a Party that fails to identify a taxation
            measure in its notice of intention to submit a claim may not
            submit a claim to arbitration concerning that measure under
            Article 10.23 (Investment – Submission of a Claim to
            Arbitration). If a Party has referred the issue to the
            designated authorities and they have not decided the issue
            within 6 months of the referral, the Tribunal shall decide
            the issue.
          
      
      
        10. If an investor invokes Article 10.11 (Investment –
        Expropriation) as the basis for a claim under Article 10.19
        (Investment – Claim by an Investor of a Party on Its Own Behalf)
        or Article 10.20 (Investment – Claim by an Investor of a Party
        on Behalf of an Enterprise), the designated authorities shall
        make a determination under paragraph 8 of whether a measure is
        an expropriation concurrently with a decision under paragraph
        9(b) of whether the measure is a taxation measure.
      
        11. The designated authorities seized of an issue under
        paragraphs 8 or 9 may modify the time period allowed to decide
        the issue.
      
        12. This Agreement does not require a Party to furnish or allow
        access to information the disclosure of which would be contrary
        to the Party’s law protecting information concerning the
        taxation affairs of a taxpayer.</article>
      <article number="ARTICLE 22.5" name="Balance Of Payments" article_identifier="39367">1. This Agreement does not prevent a Party from adopting or

            the Party experiences serious balance of payments
            difficulties, or the threat of balance of payment

            consultations.
          
      
      
        3. A measure permitted by paragraph 1 must:
      
    
          
            avoid unnecessary damage to the commercial, economic or
            financial interests of the other Party;
          
      
          
            not be more burdensome than necessary to deal with the
            balance of payments difficulties or threat of balance of
            payment difficulties;

            treatment basis, whichever is better.
          
      
      
        4. A Party adopting or maintaining a measure referred to in
        paragraph 1 may give priority to services that are essential to
        its economic program, if:
      
    
          
            the Party does not impose a measure for the purpose of
            protecting a specific industry or sector; or
          
      
          
            further to sub-paragraph 3(d), the measure is consistent
            with sub-paragraph 2(c) and with Article VIII(3) of the
            Articles of Agreement of the IMF.

            current international transactions under sub-paragraph 2(a);
          
      
          
            if imposed on transfers covered by Article 10.10 (Investment
            – Transfers) and transfers related to trade in goods, may
            not substantially impede transfers from being made in a
            freely usable currency at a market rate of exchange; and
          
      
          
            may not take the form of tariff surcharges, quotas,

        7. In discussions under sub-paragraph 6(b), the Parties shall
        accept all statistical and other findings presented by the IMF
        relating to foreign exchange, monetary reserves, and balance of
        payments, and shall base their conclusions on the assessment by
        the IMF regarding the balance of payments and the external
