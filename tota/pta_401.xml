Disclosures shall be made in writing, and interested parties shall be allowed sufficient time to make their comments. 


3. The Parties shall observe the following practices in anti-dumping or countervailing cases between them in order to enhance transparency in the implementation of the WTO Agreement: 


(a) 	when dumping margins are established, assessed, or reviewed under Articles 2, 9.3, 9.5, and 11 of the Anti-Dumping Agreement regardless of the comparison bases under Article 2.4.2 of the Anti-Dumping Agreement, all individual margins, whether positive or negative, should be counted toward the average; 


(b) 	if a decision is taken to impose an anti-dumping duty pursuant to Article 9.1 of the Anti-Dumping Agreement, the Party taking such a decision may apply the „lesser duty‟ rule, by imposing a duty which is less than the dumping margin where such lesser duty would be adequate to remove the injury to the domestic industry; and 


(c) 	the investigating Party shall request an exporter or producer in the territory of the other Party for the timely response to its questionnaires. When the investigating Party finds major deficiency in information in a questionnaire response from relevant exporter or producer received before the deadline or requires clarifications for the purposes of investigation, the investigating Party shall demand missing information or request clarification of information concerning the answers to the questionnaires. This procedure shall not be used 
to cause unwarranted delays in the investigation or to circumvent the deadlines which are provided in the Party‟s domestic laws and regulations.</article>

Notwithstanding paragraph 8, either Party may make public statements as to its views regarding the dispute, but shall treat as confidential information and written submissions delivered by the other Party to the arbitration panel which the other Party has designated as confidential. Where a Party has provided information or written submissions designated to be confidential, that Party shall, within 20 days of a request of the other Party, provide a non-confidential summary of the information or written submissions which may be disclosed publicly. 


10. The reports of the arbitration panel shall be drafted without the presence of the Parties.

The findings and determinations and, if applicable, any recommendations of the arbitration panel cannot add to or diminish the rights and obligations of the Parties provided for in this Agreement.

If there is no agreement, the venue shall alternate between the capitals of the Parties with the first meeting of the arbitration panel proceedings to be held in the capital of the Party complained against.</article>

Upon request of a Party, the arbitration panel proceedings shall be resumed after such suspension. In the event of such suspension, the timeframes regarding the work of the arbitration panel shall be extended by the amount of time that the work was suspended. If, in any case, each period of the suspension of the work of the arbitration panel exceeds 12 months, the authority of the arbitration panel shall lapse unless the Parties otherwise agree. This lapse shall not prejudice the rights of the complaining Party to request, at a later stage, the establishment of an arbitration panel on the same subject matter.

(b) 	whether a Party has otherwise failed to carry out its obligations under this Agreement, 
as well as the applicability of the relevant provisions and the basic rationale behind any findings. 


2. Where the arbitration panel considers that the deadline for interim report cannot be met, it may extend the period with the consent of the Parties with the written notification stating the reasons for the delay and the date on which the panel plans to issue its interim report. Under no circumstances should the interim report be issued later than 120 days after the date of the establishment of the arbitration panel. 


3. Either Party may submit written comments to the arbitration panel on its interim report within 15 days of the issuance of the report. After considering any written comments by the Parties on the interim report, the arbitration panel may modify its report and make any further examination it considers appropriate.</article>

3. The reasonable period of time referred to in paragraph 2 shall be mutually agreed by the Parties. Where the Parties fail to agree on the reasonable period of time within 45 days of the date of issuance of the final report of the arbitration panel, either Party may refer the matter to the original arbitration panel, which shall determine the reasonable period of time. 


4. The Party complained against shall notify to the complaining Party the implementing measures that it has taken to comply with the determinations of the arbitration panel, before the expiry of the reasonable period of time agreed by the Parties or determined by the original arbitration panel in accordance with paragraph 3. Where there is disagreement between the Parties as to whether the Party complained against has eliminated the nonconformity as determined in the final report of the arbitration panel within the reasonable period of time as determined pursuant to paragraph 3, either Party may refer the matter to the original arbitration panel.</article>

2. If there is no agreement on satisfactory compensation within 20 days of the date of receipt of the request mentioned in paragraph 1, the complaining Party may, at any time, provide written notice to the Party complained against that it intends to suspend the application to the Party complained against of concessions or other obligations under this Agreement. The complaining Party may begin suspending concessions or other obligations 30 days after the notification of such suspension. The notification of suspension shall not be made within 20 days of the date of receipt of the request mentioned in paragraph 1. 


3. The compensation referred to in paragraph 1 and the suspension referred to in paragraph 2 shall be temporary measures. Neither compensation nor suspension is preferred to full elimination of the non-conformity as determined in the report of the arbitration panel. The suspension shall only be applied until such time as the non-conformity is fully eliminated or a mutually satisfactory solution is reached. 


4. In considering what concessions or other obligations to suspend pursuant to paragraph 2: 


(a) 	the complaining Party should first seek to suspend concessions or other obligations with respect to the same sector or sectors as that in which the report of the arbitration panel referred to in Article 15.12 has found a failure to comply with the obligations under this Agreement; 


(b) 	if the complaining Party considers that it is not practicable or effective to suspend concessions or other obligations with respect to the same sector or sectors, it may suspend concessions or other obligations with respect to other sectors. The notification of such suspension pursuant to paragraph 2 shall indicate the reasons on which it is based; and 


(c) 	the level of suspension referred to in paragraph 2 shall be equivalent to the level of the nullification or impairment. 

5. If the Party complained against considers that the requirements for the suspension of concessions or other obligations by the complaining Party set out in paragraph 2, 3, or 4 have not been met, it may refer the matter to an arbitration panel.
