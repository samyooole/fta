A Party may, as a bilateral safeguard measure:  (a) suspend the further reduction of any rate of customs duty on the originating good provided for in this Chapter; or  (b) increase the rate of customs duty on the originating good to a level not to exceed the lesser of:   (i) the most-favoured-nation applied rate of customs duty in effect at the time when the bilateral safeguard measure is taken; and   (ii) the most-favoured-nation applied rate of customs duty in effect on the day immediately preceding the date of entry into force of this Agreement. 3. (a) A Party may take a bilateral safeguard measure only after an investigation has been carried out by the competent authorities of that Party in accordance with the same procedures as those provided for in Article 3 and subparagraph 2(c) of Article 4 of the Agreement on Safeguards in Annex 1A to the WTO Agreement, as may be amended (hereinafter referred to in this Article as “the Agreement on Safeguards”).  (b) The investigation referred to in subparagraph (a) shall in all cases be completed within one year following its date of initiation.  (c) In the investigation referred to in subparagraph (a) to determine whether increased imports of an originating good have caused or are threatening to cause serious injury to a domestic industry under the terms of this Article, the competent authorities of a Party who carry out the investigation shall evaluate all relevant factors of an objective and quantifiable nature having a bearing on the situation of that domestic industry, in particular, the rate and amount of the increase in imports of the originating good in absolute terms, the share of the domestic market taken by the increased imports of the originating good, and the changes in the level of sales, production, productivity, capacity utilisation, profits and losses, and employment.  (d) The determination that increased imports of an originating good have caused or are threatening to cause serious injury to a domestic industry shall not be made unless the investigation referred to in subparagraph (a) demonstrates, on the basis of objective evidence, the existence of the causal link between increased imports of the originating good and serious injury or threat of serious injury.  When factors other than the increased imports of the originating good are causing injury to the domestic industry at the same time, such injury shall not be attributed to the increased imports of the originating good. 4. The following conditions and limitations shall apply with regard to a bilateral safeguard measure:  (a) A Party shall immediately deliver a written notice to the other Party upon:   (i) initiating an investigation referred to in subparagraph 3(a) relating to serious injury, or threat of serious injury, and the reasons for it; and   (ii) taking a decision to apply or extend a bilateral safeguard measure.

(c) A Party proposing to apply or extend a bilateral safeguard measure shall provide adequate opportunity for prior consultation with the other Party with a view to reviewing the information arising from the investigation referred to in subparagraph 3(a), exchanging views on the bilateral safeguard measure and reaching an agreement on compensation set out in paragraph 5.  (d) No bilateral safeguard measure shall be maintained except to the extent and for such time as may be necessary to prevent or remedy serious injury and to facilitate adjustment, provided that such time shall not exceed a period of three years.  However, in very exceptional circumstances, a bilateral safeguard measure may be extended, provided that the total period of the bilateral safeguard measure, including such extensions, shall not exceed four years.  In order to facilitate adjustment in a situation where the expected duration of a bilateral safeguard measure is over one year, the Party maintaining the bilateral safeguard measure shall progressively liberalise the bilateral safeguard measure at regular intervals during the period of application.  (e) No bilateral safeguard measure shall be applied again to the import of a particular originating good which has been subject to such a bilateral safeguard measure, for a period of time equal to the duration of the previous bilateral safeguard measure or one year, whichever is longer.  (f) Upon the termination of a bilateral safeguard measure, the rate of customs duty shall be the rate which would have been in effect but for the bilateral safeguard measure. 5. (a) A Party proposing to apply or extend a bilateral safeguard measure shall provide to the other Party mutually agreed adequate means of trade compensation in the form of concessions of customs duties whose levels are substantially equivalent to the value of the additional customs duties expected to result from the bilateral safeguard measure.  (b) If the Parties are unable to agree on the compensation within 30 days after the commencement of the consultation pursuant to subparagraph 4(c), the Party against whose originating good the bilateral safeguard measure is taken shall be free to suspend the application of concessions of customs duties under this Agreement, which are substantially equivalent to the bilateral safeguard measure.  The Party exercising the right of suspension may suspend the application of concessions of customs duties only for the minimum period necessary to achieve the substantially equivalent effects. 6. Nothing in this Chapter shall prevent a Party from applying safeguard measures to an originating good of the other Party in accordance with:  (a) Article XIX of the GATT 1994 and the Agreement on Safeguards; or  (b) Article 5 of the Agreement on Agriculture. 7. Each Party shall ensure the consistent, impartial and reasonable administration of its laws and regulations relating to bilateral safeguard measure. 8. Each Party shall adopt or maintain equitable, timely, transparent and effective procedures relating to bilateral safeguard measure. 9. (a) In critical circumstances, where delay would cause damage which it would be difficult to repair, a Party may take a provisional bilateral safeguard measure, which shall take the form of the measure set out in subparagraph 2(a) or (b) pursuant to a preliminary determination that there is clear evidence that increased imports of an originating good of the other Party have caused or are threatening to cause serious injury to a domestic industry.  (b) A Party shall deliver a written notice to the other Party prior to applying a provisional bilateral safeguard measure.  Consultations between the Parties on the application of the provisional bilateral safeguard measure shall be initiated immediately after the provisional bilateral safeguard measure is taken.  (c) The duration of a provisional bilateral safeguard measure shall not exceed 200 days.  During that period, the pertinent requirements of paragraph 3 shall be met.  The duration of the provisional bilateral safeguard measure shall be counted as a part of the period referred to in subparagraph 4(d).  (d) Subparagraph 4(f) and paragraphs 7 and 8 shall be applied mutatis mutandis to a provisional bilateral safeguard measure.  The customs duty imposed as a result of a provisional bilateral safeguard measure shall be refunded if the subsequent investigation referred to in subparagraph 3(a) does not determine that increased imports of an originating good of the other Party have caused or threatened to cause serious injury to a domestic industry. 10. A written notice referred to in subparagraphs 4(a) and 9(b) and any other communication between the Parties shall be done in the English language. 11. The Parties shall review the provisions of this Article, if necessary, after five years of the date of entry into force of this Agreement.</article>

For the purposes of this Chapter, an “investment dispute” is a dispute between a Party and an investor of the other Party that has incurred loss or damage by reason of, or arising out of, an alleged breach of any obligation under this Chapter with respect to the investor and its investments. 2. Nothing in this Article shall be construed so as to prevent an investor who is a party to an investment dispute (hereinafter referred to in this Article as “disputing investor”) from seeking administrative or judicial settlement within the Party that is a party to the investment dispute (hereinafter referred to in this Article as “disputing Party”). 3. An investment dispute shall, as far as possible, be settled amicably through consultation or negotiation between the disputing investor and the disputing Party (hereinafter referred to in this Article as “the disputing parties”). 4. If the investment dispute cannot be settled through such consultation or negotiation within five months from the date on which the disputing investor requested for the consultation or negotiation in writing and if the disputing investor has not submitted the investment dispute for resolution under courts of justice or administrative tribunals or agencies, the disputing investor may submit the investment dispute to one of the following international conciliations or arbitrations:  (a) conciliation or arbitration in accordance with the ICSID Convention, so long as the ICSID Convention is in force between the Parties;  (b) conciliation or arbitration under the ICSID Additional Facility Rules, so long as the ICSID Convention is not in force between the Parties;  (c) arbitration under the Arbitration Rules of the United Nations Commission on International Trade Law, adopted by the United Nations Commission on International Trade Law on April 28, 1976, as may be amended; and  (d) if agreed with the disputing Party, any arbitration in accordance with other arbitration rules. 5. For greater certainty, an investor of a Party may not submit to conciliation or arbitration referred to in paragraph 4 a dispute arising out of events which occurred, or a dispute which had been settled, prior to the date of entry into force of this Agreement. 6. A disputing investor may not submit to conciliation or arbitration referred to in paragraph 4 an investment dispute with respect to the establishment, acquisition or expansion of its investments. 7. The applicable arbitration rules shall govern the arbitration set forth in paragraph 4 except to the extent modified in this Article. 8. A disputing investor who intends to submit an investment dispute to conciliation or arbitration pursuant to paragraph 4 shall give to the disputing Party written notice of intent to do so at least 90 days before the investment dispute is submitted.  The notice of intent shall specify:  (a) the name and address of the disputing investor;  (b) the specific measures of the disputing Party at issue and a brief summary of the factual and legal basis of the investment dispute sufficient to present the problem clearly, including the obligations under this Chapter alleged to have been breached;  (c) conciliation or arbitration set forth in paragraph 4 which the disputing investor will choose; and  (d) the relief sought and the approximate amount of damages claimed. 9. (a) Each Party hereby consents to the submission of investment disputes by a disputing investor to conciliation or arbitration set forth in paragraph 4 chosen by the disputing investor.  (b) The consent given by subparagraph (a) and the submission by a disputing investor of an investment dispute to arbitration shall satisfy the requirements of:   (i) Chapter II of the ICSID Convention or the ICSID Additional Facility Rules, for written consent of the parties to a dispute; and   (ii) Article II of the New York Convention for an agreement in writing. 10.

Notwithstanding paragraph 4, a disputing investor may initiate or continue an action that seeks interim injunctive relief that does not involve the payment of damages before an administrative tribunal or agency or a court of justice under the applicable laws of the disputing Party. 12. Unless the disputing parties agree otherwise, an arbitral tribunal established under paragraph 4 shall comprise three arbitrators, one arbitrator appointed by each of the disputing parties and the third, who shall be the presiding arbitrator, appointed by agreement of the disputing parties.  If the disputing investor or the disputing Party fails to appoint an arbitrator or arbitrators within 60 days from the date on which the investment dispute was submitted to arbitration, the Secretary-General of the ICSID may be requested by either of the disputing parties, to appoint the arbitrator or arbitrators not yet appointed from the ICSID Panel of Arbitrators subject to the requirements of paragraphs 13 and 14. 13. Unless the disputing parties agree otherwise, the third arbitrator shall not be a national of either Party, nor have his or her usual place of residence in either Party, nor be employed by either of the disputing parties, nor have dealt with the investment dispute in any capacity. 14. In the case of arbitration referred to in paragraph 4, each of the disputing parties may indicate up to three nationalities, the appointment of arbitrators of which is unacceptable to it.  In this event, the Secretary-General of the ICSID may be requested not to appoint as arbitrator any person whose nationality is indicated by either of the disputing parties. 15.

The arbitral tribunal shall not order attachment or enjoin the application of the measure alleged to constitute a breach referred to in paragraph 1. 20. The award rendered by the arbitral tribunal shall include:  (a) a judgment whether or not there has been a breach by the disputing Party of any obligation under this Chapter with respect to the disputing investor and its investments; and  (b) a remedy if there has been such breach.  The remedy shall be limited to one or both of the following:   (i) payment of monetary damages and applicable interest; and   (ii) restitution of property, in which case the award shall provide that the disputing Party may pay monetary damages and any applicable interest in lieu of restitution.  Costs may also be awarded in accordance with the applicable arbitration rules. 21. The award rendered in accordance with paragraph 20 shall be final and binding upon the disputing parties.  The disputing Party shall carry out without delay the provisions of the award and provide in its Area for the enforcement of the award in accordance with its relevant laws and regulations. 22. Neither Party shall give diplomatic protection, or bring an international claim, in respect of an investment dispute which the other Party and an investor of the former Party have consented to submit or submitted to arbitration set forth in paragraph 4, unless the other Party shall have failed to abide by and comply with the award rendered in such investment dispute.
