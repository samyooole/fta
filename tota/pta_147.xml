Subject to the following paragraphs of this Article, a Party shall be free to take ASEAN-Korea FTA safeguard measures if as an effect of the obligations incurred by the Party under this Agreement, including tariff concessions, or, if as a result of unforeseen developments and of the effects of the obligations incurred by the Party, a good is being imported from the other Parties to which tariff concession was made for that good in such increased quantities, absolute or relative to domestic production, and under such conditions so as to substantially cause or threaten to cause serious injury to the domestic industry of the importing Party that produces like or directly competitive goods in its territory. 4.
