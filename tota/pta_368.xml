  (a) Contributing to the reduction and eventual eradication of poverty
  through the establishment of a trade partnership consistent with the
  objective of sustainable development, the Millennium Development Goals

  of the progressive, asymmetrical liberalisation of trade between them
  and reinforce, broaden and deepen cooperation in all areas relevant to
  trade and investment.</article>
      <article number="ARTICLE 2" name="Principles" article_identifier="27641">1. This Agreement is based on the Fundamental Principles as well as
  the Essential and Fundamental Elements of the Cotonou Agreement, as
  set out in Articles 2 and 9, respectively, of the Cotonou Agreement.
  This Agreement shall build on the provisions of the Cotonou Agreement
  and the previous ACP-EC Partnership Agreements in the area of regional
  cooperation and integration as well as economic and trade cooperation.

  2. The Parties agree that the Cotonou Agreement and this Agreement
  shall be implemented in a complementary and mutually reinforcing
  manner.</article>
      <article number="ARTICLE 3" name="Sustainable Development" article_identifier="27642">1. The Parties reaffirm that the objective of sustainable development
  is to be applied and integrated at every level of their economic
  partnership, in fulfilment of the overarching commitments set out in
  Articles 1, 2 and 9 of the Cotonou Agreement, and especially the
  general commitment to reducing and eventually eradicating poverty in a
  way that is consistent with the objectives of sustainable development.

  2. The Parties understand this objective to apply in the case of the
  present Economic Partnership Agreement as a commitment that:

  (a) the application of this Agreement shall fully take into account
  the human, cultural, economic, social, health and environmental best
  interests of their respective population and of future generations;

  (b) decision-taking methods shall embrace the fundamental principles
  of ownership, participation and dialogue.

  States and the Agreement establishing a Free Trade Area between the
  Caribbean Community and the Dominican Republic.

  4. The Parties further recognise that, without prejudice to the
  commitments undertaken in this Agreement, the pace and content of
  regional integration are matters to be determined exclusively by the
  CARIFORUM States in the exercise of their sovereignty and in the light
  of their current and future political ambitions.

  5. The Parties agree that their partnership builds upon and aims at
  deepening regional integration and undertake to cooperate to develop
  it further, taking into account the Parties' levels of development,
  needs, geographical realities and sustainable development strategies,

  themselves and the obligations enshrined in the existing regional
  integration agreements identified in paragraph 3.

  the implementation of this Agreement and to support CARIFORUM regional
  integration.</article>

  Agreement through their respective participative processes and
  institutions, as well as those set up under this Agreement, in order
  to ensure that the objectives of the Agreement are realised, the
  Agreement is properly implemented and the benefits for men, women,
  young people and children deriving from their Partnership are

  framework of the rules and relevant procedures provided for by the

  relevant instruments financed by the General Budget of the European
  Union. In this context, supporting the implementation of this
  Agreement shall be one of the priorities.

  4. Commensurate with their respective roles and responsibilities, the

  measures necessary to ensure the effective mobilisation, provision and
  utilisation of resources aimed at facilitating the development
  cooperation activities provided for in this Agreement.

  Article 22.

  5. With a view to ensuring transparency, such duties shall be notified
  to the CARIFORUM-EC Trade and Development Committee within six months
  of the date of signature of this Agreement. Their elimination shall
  also be notified promptly to the CARIFORUM-EC Trade and Development
  Committee.

  6. In the event of serious difficulties in respect of imports of a
  given product, the schedule of customs duty reductions and
  eliminations may be reviewed by the CARIFORUM-EC Trade and Development
  Committee by common accord with a view to possibly modifying the time
  schedule for reduction or elimination. Any such modification shall not
  lead to the time periods in the schedule for which the review has been
  requested being extended in respect of the product concerned beyond
  the maximum transitional period for duty reduction or elimination for
  that product as provided for in Annex III. If the CARIFORUM-EC Trade
  and Development Committee has not taken a decision within 30 days of
  an application to review the timetable, the CARIFORUM States may
  suspend the timetable provisionally for a period that may not exceed
  one year.</article>

  of the other Party in such increased quantities and under such
  conditions as to cause or threaten to cause:

  (a) serious injury to the domestic industry producing like or directly

  Development Committee aimed at remedying the circumstances, or no
  other satisfactory solution has been reached within 30 days of the
  matter being referred to the CARIFORUM-EC Trade and Development
  Committee, the importing party may adopt the appropriate measures to
  remedy the circumstances in accordance with this Article.

  (c) Before taking any measure provided for in this Article or, in the
  cases to which paragraph 8 applies, as soon as possible, the Party or
  the signatory CARIFORUM State concerned shall supply the CARIFORUM-EC
  Trade and Development Committee with all relevant information required
  for a thorough examination of the situation, with a view to seeking a
  solution acceptable to the parties concerned.

  (d) In the selection of safeguard measures pursuant to this Article,

  Committee and shall be the subject of periodic consultations within

  importing party concerned, whether the EC Party, the CARIFORUM States
  or a Signatory CARIFORUM State as the case may be, may take the
  measures provided for in paragraphs 3, 4 and/or 5 on a provisional
  basis without complying with the requirements of paragraph 7. Such
  action may be taken for a maximum period of 180 days where measures
  are taken by the EC Party and 200 days where measures are taken by the
  CARIFORUM States or a Signatory CARIFORUM State, or where measures
  taken by the EC Party are limited to the territory of one or more of

  referred to in paragraph 6. In the taking of such provisional
  measures, the interest of all parties involved shall be taken into
  account. The importing party concerned shall inform the other party
  concerned and it shall immediately refer the matter to the
  CARIFORUM-EC Trade and Development Committee for examination.

  9. If an importing party subjects imports of a product to an
  administrative procedure having as its purpose the rapid provision of
  information on the trend of trade flows liable to give rise to the
  problems referred to in this Article, it shall inform the CARIFORUM-EC
  Trade and Development Committee without delay.

  sector.

  3. In particular, the Parties shall encourage the relevant

      <article number="ARTICLE 86" name="Transparency" article_identifier="27726">Subject to Article 235(3) the Parties and the Signatory CARIFORUM
  States shall respond promptly to all requests made by the other Party

  enquiry points are listed in Annex V. Enquiry points need not be
  depositories of laws and regulations.</article>
      <article number="ARTICLE 87" name="Procedures" article_identifier="27727">1. Where authorisation is required for the supply of a service or

  competent authorities of the Parties and of the Signatory CARIFORUM
  States shall, within a reasonable period of time after the submission
  of an application considered complete under domestic laws and
  regulations, inform the applicant of the decision concerning the
  application. At the request of the applicant, the competent
  authorities of the Parties or of the Signatory CARIFORUM States as the
  case may be shall provide, without undue delay, information concerning
  the status of the application.

  2. The Parties and the Signatory CARIFORUM States shall maintain or

  persons for business purpose. Where such procedures are not
  independent of the agency entrusted with the administrative decision
  concerned, the Parties and the Signatory CARIFORUM States shall ensure

  review.

  Computer services</article>
      <article number="ARTICLE 88" name="Understanding On Computer Services" article_identifier="27728">1. To the extent that trade in computer services is liberalised in
  accordance with Chapters 2, 3 and 4 of this Title, the EC Party and
  the Signatory CARIFORUM States subscribe to the understanding defined
  in paragraphs 2, 3 and 4.

  2. CPC 84, the United Nations code used for describing computer and
  related services, covers the basic functions used to provide all
  computer and related services: computer programs defined as the sets
  of instructions required to make computers work and communicate
  (including their development and implementation), data processing and
  storage, and related services, such as consultancy and training
  services for staff of clients. Technological developments have led to
  the increased offering of these services as a bundle or package of
  related services that can include some or all of these basic
  functions. For example, services such as web or domain hosting, data
  mining services and grid computing each consist of a combination of
  basic computer services functions.

  3. Computer and related services, regardless of whether they are
  delivered via a network, including the Internet, include all services
  that provide:

  (a) consulting, strategy, analysis, planning, specification, design,
  development, installation, implementation, integration, testing,
  debugging, updating, support, technical assistance, or management of
  or for computers or computer systems; or

  (b) computer programs defined as the sets of instructions required to
  make computers work and communicate (in and of themselves), plus
  consulting, strategy, analysis, planning, specification, design,
  development, installation, implementation, integration, testing,
  debugging, updating, adaptation, maintenance, support, technical
  assistance, management or use of or for computer programs; or

  (c) data processing, data storage, data hosting or database services;
  or

  (d) maintenance and repair services for office machinery and
  equipment, including computers; or

  (e) training services for staff of clients, related to computer
  programs, computers or computer systems, and not elsewhere classified.

  4. Computer and related services enable the provision of other
  services (e.g. banking) by both electronic and other means. However,
  there is an important distinction between the enabling service (e.g.
  web-hosting or application hosting) and the content or core service
  that is being delivered electronically (e.g. banking). In such cases,
  the content or core service is not covered by CPC 84.

  basis;

  loading and unloading.

  (b) upon the entry into force of this Agreement, abolish and abstain
  from introducing any unilateral measures and administrative, technical
  and other obstacles which could constitute a disguised restriction or
  have discriminatory effects on the free supply of services in

  geographical indications that are not protected in their country of
  origin.

  2. The Signatory CARIFORUM States shall establish a system of
  protection of geographical indications in their respective territories
  no later than 1 January 2014. The Parties shall cooperate through the
  CARIFORUM-EC Trade and Development Committee in accordance with the
  provisions of Article 164(2)(c) towards the development of
  geographical indications in the territories of the CARIFORUM States.
  To this end, and within six months from the entry into force of the
  Agreement, the CARIFORUM States shall submit to the consideration of
  the CARIFORUM EC Trade and Development Committee a list of prospective
  Geographical Indications originating in the CARIFORUM States for its
  discussion and comments.

  3. The Parties shall discuss within the CARIFORUM EC Trade and
  Development Committee the effective implementation of this Article and
  exchange information on legislative and policy developments on
  geographical indications.

  B. Term of protection

  1. Protection afforded in respect of geographical indications in the
  EC Party and the Signatory CARIFORUM States shall be granted in
  accordance with the legal system and practice of the EC Party or the
  relevant Signatory CARIFORUM State as the case may be, and shall be
  indefinite [26].

  2. Such protection shall ensure that the use of geographical
  indications of goods protected pursuant to paragraph 1 be exclusively
  reserved in the EC Party and the Signatory CARIFORUM States to goods
  originating in the geographical area concerned and that are produced
  in accordance with the relevant product specifications.

  3. In respect of the protection of geographical indications, the EC
  Party and the Signatory CARIFORUM States shall prohibit and prevent,
  ex officio or at the request of an interested party:

  (a) regardless of the class of product on which it is used, the use in
  their territory of any means in the designation or presentation of a
  good that indicates or suggests that the good in question originates
  in a geographical area other than the true place or origin in a manner
  which misleads the public as to the true geographical origin of the
  good; or any other use which constitutes an act of unfair competition
  within the meaning of Article 10bis of the Paris Convention;

  (b) any use of the protected names for goods in the same class of
  product as the geographical indication which do not originate in the
  geographical area indicated, even where:

  (i) the true origin of the good is indicated;

  (ii) the geographical indication in question is used in translation;

  (iii) the name is accompanied by terms such as "kind",
  "type", "style", "imitation",
  "method" or other expressions of the sort.

  4. It shall be possible to cancel the registration of a geographical
  indication. The procedure to this effect shall allow for the
  participation of any natural or legal person having a legitimate
  interest.

  required to apply the protection of geographical indications referred
  to in section B with respect to goods for which the relevant
  indication is identical with the term customary in common language as
  the common name for such goods in their respective territories.

  2. Nothing in this Section shall require the EC Party and the
  Signatory CARIFORUM States to apply the protection of geographical
  indications referred to in section B with respect to products of the
  vine, plants or animals for which the relevant indication is identical
  with the name of a grape variety, plant variety or animal breed
  existing in the territory of the EC Party or the Signatory CARIFORUM
  State concerned as of the date of entry into force of this Agreement.

  3. Homonymous geographical indications shall be protected by the EC
  Party and Signatory CARIFORUM States provided that there is a
  sufficient distinction in practice between the geographical indication
  first protected and the homonym subsequently protected, having regard
  to the need to treat the producers concerned in an equitable manner
  and not to mislead consumers. A homonymous name that misleads the
  consumer in to believing that products come from another territory
  shall not be protected by the EC Party or the Signatory CARIFORUM
  State concerned.

  4. If a geographical indication of the EC Party or Signatory CARIFORUM
  State is homonymous with a geographical indication for a third
  country, Article 23(3) of the TRIPS Agreement applies mutatis
  mutandis.

  D. Relationship between geographical indications and trade marks

  1. A geographical indication shall not be registered in the EC Party
  or the Signatory CARIFORUM States where, in the light of a trade
  mark's reputation and renown and the length of time it has been used,
  registration is liable to mislead the consumer as to the true identity
  of the product.

  2. From the date of entry into force of this Agreement, the
  registration of a trade mark which is identical with, similar to or
  containing a geographical indication protected respectively in the EC
  Party or in the Signatory CARIFORUM States pursuant to section B and
  relating to the same class of product shall be refused respectively in
  the EC Party or in the Signatory CARIFORUM States. Furthermore, the
  registration of a trade mark in such circumstances shall be refused
  respectively in the EC Party or in the Signatory CARIFORUM States if
  the application for registration of the trade mark was submitted after
  the date of application for protection of the geographical indication
  in the territory concerned and the geographical indication is
  subsequently protected.

  3. Trade marks registered in breach of the preceding paragraph shall
  be invalidated.

  4. The EC Party and the Signatory CARIFORUM States shall ensure that,
  subject to the provisions of section D(1), (2) and (3), a trade mark,
  the use of which corresponds to one of the situations referred to in
  section B(3), and which has been applied for, registered or
  established by use, if that possibility is provided for by the
  applicable legislation, in good faith within the territories of the EC
  Party or of a Signatory CARIFORUM State, before the date of
  application of the WTO obligations in the EC Party or a Signatory
  CARIFORUM State, or before the date of application for protection of
  the geographical indication in the respective territories, may
  continue to be used notwithstanding the registration of the
  geographical indication, provided that no grounds for the invalidity
  or revocation of the trade mark exist as specified by the legislation
  of the EC Party or of the concerned Signatory CARIFORUM State. In such
  case, the use of the geographical indication shall be permitted
  alongside the relevant trade mark.

  protected by a design right or copyright.

  C. Exceptions

  1. The EC Party and the Signatory CARIFORUM States may provide limited
  exceptions to the protection of industrial designs, provided that such

  account of the legitimate interests of third parties.

  2. Design protection shall not extend to designs dictated essentially
  by technical or functional considerations.

  3. A design right shall not subsist in a design which is contrary to
  public policy or to accepted principles of morality.

  prevent third parties not having the owner's consent from making,
  offering, selling, importing, stocking or using articles bearing, or
  embodying the protected design when such acts are undertaken for
  commercial purposes, or unduly prejudice the normal exploitation of
  the design or are not compatible with fair trade practice.

  2. For unregistered designs, the contested use shall not be deemed to
  result from copying the protected design if it results from an
  independent work of creation from a designer who may be reasonably
  thought not to be familiar with the design made available to the
  public by the holder.

  E. Term of protection

  1. The initial duration of protection available in the EC Party and
  the Signatory CARIFORUM States following registration shall amount to
  at least five years. At the request of the right holder, registration
  shall be renewed for one or more periods of five years each, but not
  exceeding 25 years from the date of filing, provided that the renewal
  fee has been paid.

  protection all those products and processes the prevention within
  their territory of the commercial exploitation of which is necessary

  from protection:

  (a) diagnostic, therapeutic and surgical methods for the treatment of
  humans or animals;

  (b) subject to Article 150, plants and animals other than

  respect of any specific procurement, procuring entities shall ensure
  that such methods are specified in the notice of intended procurement
  or tender documents.

  2. The Parties or the Signatory CARIFORUM States shall ensure that
  their laws and regulations clearly prescribe the conditions under

  objective criteria for such limitation.

  3. Where the tender documentation is not made publicly available from
  the date of publication of the notice referred to in paragraph 1,
  procuring entities shall ensure that those documents are made
  available at the same time to all the qualified suppliers selected.</article>
      <article number="ARTICLE 171" name="Limited Tendering" article_identifier="27811">1. When using the limited tendering procedure, a procuring entity may
  choose not to apply Articles 168, 169(1) and (3), 170, 173 (1), 174,

  2. Procuring entities may award their public contracts by limited
  tendering procedure, in the following cases:

  (a) when no suitable tenders have been submitted in response to an
  open or selective tendering procedure, on condition that the
  requirements of the initial tender are not substantially modified;

  (b) when, for technical or artistic reasons, or for reasons connected
  with protection of exclusive rights, the contract may be performed
  only by a particular supplier and no reasonable alternative or
  substitute exists;

  (c) for reasons of extreme urgency brought about by events unforeseen
  by the procuring entity, the products or services could not be
  obtained in time by means of open or selective tendering procedures;

  (d) for additional deliveries of goods or services by the original
  supplier where a change of supplier would compel the procuring entity
  to procure equipment or services not meeting requirements of
  interchangeability with already existing equipment or services
  procured under the initial procurement and such separation would cause
  significant inconvenience or substantial duplication of costs to the
  procuring entity;

  (e) when a procuring entity procures prototypes or a first product or
  service which are developed at its request in the course of, and for,
  a particular contract for research, experiment, study or original

  of the amount of the original contract;

  (g) for new services consisting of the repetition of similar services
  which conform to a basic project for which an initial contract was

  awarding contracts for such new services;

  (h) for products purchased on a commodity market;

  (i) in the case of contracts awarded to the winner of a design

  this Chapter shall not apply rules of origin to goods or services
  imported from or supplied by the EC Party and the Signatory CARIFORUM
  States as the case may be that are different from the rules of origin
  applicable at the same time in the normal course of trade to imports
  or supplies of the same goods or services from the same Signatory
  CARIFORUM State or the EC Party.</article>
      <article number="ARTICLE 173" name="Technical Specifications" article_identifier="27813">1. Consistent with the objectives of this Chapter, procuring entities
  shall ensure that technical specifications applied or intended for
  application to procurement covered by the Chapter are set out in the
  notices of intended procurement and/or tender documents.

  2. A procuring entity shall not seek or accept, in a manner that would
  have the effect of precluding competition, advice that may be used in
  the preparation or adoption of any technical specification for a
  specific procurement from a person that may have a commercial interest
  in the procurement.

  3. In prescribing technical specifications for the goods or services
  being procured, a procuring entity shall, where appropriate:

  (a) specify the technical specifications, in terms of performance and
  functional requirements, rather than design or descriptive standards;
  and

  (b) base the technical specifications on international standards,
  where such exist; otherwise, on national technical regulations,
  recognised national standards or building codes.

  4. Where design or descriptive characteristics are used in the
  technical specifications, a procuring entity shall, where appropriate,
  include words such as "or equivalent" in the technical
  specifications and consider tenders that demonstrably meet the
  required design or descriptive characteristics and are fit for the
  purposes intended.

  5. A procuring entity shall not prescribe technical specifications
  that require or refer to a particular trade mark or trade name,
  patent, copyright, design or type, specific origin, producer or
  supplier, unless there is no other sufficiently precise or
  intelligible way of describing the procurement requirements and
  provided that, in such cases, words such as "as equivalent"
  are included in the tender documentation.</article>
      <article number="ARTICLE 174" name="Qualification Of Suppliers" article_identifier="27814">1. For procurement covered by this Chapter, procuring entities shall
  ensure that any conditions and criteria for participating in a public
  contract award procedure are made known in advance in the notice of
  intended procurement or the tender documents. Any such conditions and
  criteria shall be limited to those which are essential to ensure that
  the potential supplier has the ability to execute the contract in
  question.

  2. The Signatory CARIFORUM States and the EC Party shall not impose
  the condition that, in order for a supplier to participate in a
  procurement, the supplier has previously been awarded one or more
  contracts by an entity of that Party or State or that the supplier has
  prior work experience in the relevant territory. This paragraph does
  not apply for procurements in respect of social impact surveys and
  studies.

  3. The procuring entity shall base its assessment of the financial,
  commercial and technical abilities of a supplier on the conditions
  that it has specified in advance in notices or tender documentation.

  4. Nothing in this Article shall preclude the exclusion of any
  supplier on grounds such as bankruptcy or false declarations or
  conviction for serious crime.

  5. Procuring entities may maintain a multi-use list provided that a
  notice inviting interested suppliers to apply for inclusion on the
  list is:

  (a) published annually; and

  (b) where published by electronic means, made available continuously
  in one of the appropriate media listed in Annex VII.

  6. Procuring entities shall ensure that suppliers may apply for
  qualification at any time through the publication of a notice inviting
  suppliers to apply for inclusion on the list containing the following
  information:

  (a) a description of the goods and services, or categories thereof,
  for which the list may be used;

  (b) the conditions for participation to be satisfied by suppliers and
  the methods that the procuring entity will use to verify a supplier's
  satisfaction of the conditions;

  necessary to contact the entity and obtain all relevant documents
  relating to the list; and

  (d) the period of validity of the list and the means for its renewal
  or termination, or where the period of validity is not provided, an
  indication of the method by which notice will be given of the
  termination of use of the list.

  Procuring entities shall include in the list all qualified suppliers
  within a reasonably short time.

  7. Where a non-qualified supplier submits a request for participation,
  and all required documents relating thereto, within the time-limit, a
  procuring entity, whether or not it uses a multi-use list, shall
  examine and accept the supplier's request for participation, unless,
  due to the complexity of the procurement, the entity is not able to
  complete the examination of the request. Procuring entities shall also
  ensure that a supplier having requested to be included in the list
  shall be informed of the decision in this regard in a timely fashion.

  8. Procuring entities operating in the utilities may use a notice
  inviting suppliers to apply for inclusion on a multi-use list as a
  notice of intended procurement and may exclude requests for
  participation from suppliers not yet qualified in respect of the
  procurement on the grounds that the procuring entity has insufficient
  time to examine the application.</article>
      <article number="ARTICLE 175" name="Negotiations" article_identifier="27815">1. The Signatory CARIFORUM States and the EC Party may provide for
  their procuring entities to conduct negotiations:

  (a) in the context of procurements in which they have indicated such
  intent in the notice of intended procurement; or

  (b) where it appears from the evaluation that no one tender is
  obviously the most advantageous in terms of the specific evaluation
  criteria set forth in the notice of intended procurement or tender
  documentation.

  2. A procuring entity shall:

  (a) ensure that any elimination of suppliers in negotiations is
  carried out in accordance with the evaluation criteria set out in the
  notice of intended procurement or tender documentation; and

  (b) when negotiations are concluded, provide a common deadline for the
  remaining suppliers to submit any new or revised tenders.</article>

  procuring entities shall be received and opened under procedures and
  conditions guaranteeing the fairness and transparency of the process.

  2. Unless a procuring entity decides that it is not in the public
  interest to award the contract, it shall award the contract to the
  supplier who has been determined, on the basis of the information
  presented, to be fully capable of undertaking the contract and whose
  tender is either the lowest tender or the tender which in terms of the
  specific evaluation criteria set forth in the notice or tender
  documentation is determined to be the most advantageous. Awards shall
  be made in accordance with the criteria and essential requirements
  specified in the notice of intended procurement or in the tender
  documentation.</article>

  their procuring entities provide for effective dissemination of the
  results of government procurement processes.

  regarding the award of the contract and, on request, in writing. Upon
  request, procuring entities shall inform any eliminated supplier of
  the reasons for the rejection of its tender and of the relative
  advantages of the successful supplier's tender.

  3. Procuring entities may decide to withhold certain information on
  the contract award where release of such information would interfere
  with law enforcement or be otherwise contrary to the public interest,
  would prejudice the legitimate commercial interests of suppliers, or
  might prejudice fair competition between them.

  4. Subject to Article 180(4), no later than 72 days after the award of
  each contract covered by this Chapter, a procuring entity shall
  publish a notice in the appropriate paper or electronic media listed
  in Annex VII. Where only an electronic medium is used, the information

  tendering procedure was used, a description of the circumstances
  justifying the use of such procedure.</article>

  by this Chapter, procuring entities shall, consistent with their own
  reasonable needs, take into account such factors as the complexity of
  the intended procurement and the normal time for transmitting tenders.

  2. The Parties and the Signatory CARIFORUM States shall ensure that
  their procuring entities shall take due account of publication delays
  when setting the final date for receipt of tenders or of request for
  participation or for qualifying for the supplier's list. Such time
  limits, including any extension, shall be common for all interested or
  participating suppliers.

  3. Procuring entities shall clearly set out the time limits applicable
  to any specific procurement in the notice of intended procurement
  and/or the tender documents.</article>
      <article number="ARTICLE 179" name="Bid Challenges" article_identifier="27819">1. The Parties and the Signatory CARIFORUM States shall provide
  transparent, timely, impartial and effective procedures enabling
  suppliers to challenge domestic measures implementing this Chapter in
  the context of procurements in which they have, or have had, a
  legitimate commercial interest. To this effect, each Party or
  Signatory CARIFORUM State shall establish, identify or designate at
  least one impartial administrative or judicial authority that is
  independent of its procuring entities to receive and review a
  challenge by a supplier arising in the context of covered procurement.

  2. Each supplier shall be allowed a sufficient period of time to
  prepare and submit a challenge as from the time when the basis of the
  challenge become known or reasonably should have become known to the
  supplier. This paragraph does not preclude Parties or Signatory
  CARIFORUM States from requiring complainants to lodge their complaints
  within a reasonable period of time provided that duration of that
  period is made known in advance.

  3. Procuring entities shall ensure their ability to respond to
  requests for a review by maintaining a reasonable record of each
  procurement covered under this Chapter.

  4. Challenge procedures shall provide for effective rapid interim
  measures to correct breaches of the domestic measures implementing
  this Chapter.</article>

  2. Should a review by the CARIFORUM-EC Trade and Development Committee
  at the end of the implementation period reveal that one or several
  Signatory CARIFORUM States need one more year to bring their measures
  into conformity with the obligations of this Chapter, the CARIFORUM-EC
  Trade and Development Committee may extend the implementation period
  referred to in paragraph 1 by one more year for the individual
  Signatory CARIFORUM States concerned.

  administrative capacity to be established shall, at a minimum, include
  the following content principles and enforcement mechanisms:

  (a) Content principles

  (i) the purpose limitation principle — data should be processed for a
  specific purpose and subsequently used or further communicated only in
  so far as this is not incompatible with the purpose of the transfer.
  The only exemptions to this rule would be those provided by
  legislation and necessary in a democratic society for important public
  interests;

  (ii) the data quality and proportionality principle — data should be
  accurate and, where necessary, kept up to date. The data should be
  adequate, relevant and not excessive in relation to the purposes for
  which they are transferred or further processed;

  (iii) the transparency principle — individuals should be provided with
  information as to the purpose of the processing and the identity of
  the data controller in the third country, and other information in so
  far as this is necessary to ensure fairness. The only exemptions
  permitted should be those provided by legislation and necessary in a
  democratic society for important public interests;

  (iv) the security principle — technical and organisational security
  measures should be taken by the data controller that are appropriate
  to the risks presented by the processing. Any person acting under the
  authority of the data controller, including a processor, must not
  process data except on instructions from the controller;

  (v) the rights of access, rectification and opposition — the data
  subject should have a right to obtain a copy of all data relating to
  him/her that are processed, and a right to rectification of those data
  where they are shown to be inaccurate. In certain situations he/she
  should also be able to object to the processing of the data relating
  to him/her. The only exemptions to these rights should be those
  provided by legislation and necessary in a democratic society for
  important public interests;

  (vi) restrictions on onward transfers — as a matter of principle,
  further transfers of the personal data by the recipient of the
  original data transfer should be permitted only where the second
  recipient (i.e. the recipient of the onward transfer) is also subject
  to rules affording an adequate level of protection;

  (vii) sensitive data — where special categories of data are involved,
  revealing racial or ethnic origin, political opinions, religious or
  philosophical beliefs or trade-union membership, data concerning
  health or sex life, and data relating to offences, criminal
  convictions or security measures, data may not be processed unless
  domestic law provides additional safeguards.

  (b) Enforcement mechanisms

  Appropriate mechanisms shall be in place to ensure that the following
  objectives are achieved:

  (i) to ensure a good level of compliance with the rules, including a
  high degree of awareness among data controllers of their obligations,
  and among data subjects of their rights and the means of exercising
  them; the existence of effective and dissuasive sanctions; and systems
  of direct verification by authorities, auditors, or independent data
  protection officials;

  (ii) to provide support and help to individual data subjects in the
  exercise of their rights, who must be able to enforce their rights
  rapidly and effectively, and without prohibitive cost, including
  through appropriate institutional mechanisms allowing independent
  investigation of complaints;

  (iii) to provide appropriate redress to the injured party where rules
  are not complied with allowing compensation to be paid and sanctions
  imposed where appropriate in accordance with applicable domestic
  rules.</article>

  complaining Party.

  2. If the Parties do not reach an agreement on the compatibility of
  the notified measure with the provisions of this Agreement within 30
  days of the date of the submission of the notification, the
  complaining Party shall request in writing the arbitration panel to
  rule on the matter. Such request shall be notified to the other Party
  and to the CARIFORUM-EC Trade and Development Committee. The
  arbitration panel ruling shall be notified to the Parties and to the
  CARIFORUM-EC Trade and Development Committee within 45 days of the
  date of the submission of the request. If the arbitration panel rules
  that any measure taken to comply is not in conformity with the
  provisions of this Agreement, the arbitration panel will determine
  whether the complaining Party can continue to apply appropriate
  measures. If the arbitration panel rules that any measure taken to
  comply is in conformity with the provisions of this Agreement, the

  [1] Except where expressly provided, the terms "goods" and
  "product" shall have the same meaning.

  [2] For this calculation official data by the WTO on leading exporters
  in world merchandise trade (excluding intra-EU trade) shall be used.

  [3] For the purpose of this Article agricultural products are those
  covered by Annex I of the WTO Agreement on Agriculture.

  [4] For the purpose of paragraph 1 any modification of subsidy
  payments under existing subsidy programmes due to variations in the
  market conditions shall not be deemed to be either a new subsidy
  programme or an increase in subsidy.

  [5] In line with its notification of the EC Treaty to the WTO
  (WT/REG39/1), the EC Party understands that the concept of
  "effective and continuous link" with the economy of a Member
  State enshrined in Article 48 of the EC Treaty is equivalent to the
  concept of "substantive business operations" provided in
  Article V, paragraph 6, of the GATS, and in this Agreement.

  [6] The terms "constitution" and "acquisition" of
  a juridical person shall be understood as including capital
  participation in a juridical person with a view to establishing or
  maintaining lasting economic links. When the juridical person has the
  status of a company limited by shares, there is a lasting economic
  link where the block of shares held enables the shareholder, either
  pursuant to the provisions of national laws relating to companies
  limited by shares or otherwise, to participate effectively in the
  management of the company or in its control. Long-term loans of a
  participating nature are loans for a period of more than five years
  which are made for the purpose of establishing or maintaining lasting
  economic links; the main examples being loans granted by a company to
  its subsidiaries or to companies in which it has a share and loans
  linked with a profit-sharing arrangement.

  [7] A juridical person is controlled by another juridical person if
  the latter has the power to name a majority of its directors or
  otherwise to legally direct its actions.

  [8] Measures relating to expropriation and investor-to-State dispute
  settlement such as those covered in bilateral investment treaties are
  not deemed to affect commercial presence.

  [9] National maritime cabotage covers transport services within a
  Signatory CARIFORUM State or within a Member State of the European
  Union for the carriage of passengers or goods originating and
  terminating in that Signatory Cariforum State or in that Member State
  of the European Union.

  [10] Subparagraphs 2(a), 2(b) and 2(c) do not cover measures taken in
  order to limit the production of an agricultural product.

  [11] Each Party or Signatory CARIFORUM State may require that in the
  case of incorporation under its own law, investors must adopt a
  specific legal form. To the extent that such requirement is applied in
  a non-discriminatory manner, it does not need to be specified in a
  Party's list of commitments in order to be maintained or adopted by
  that Party.

  [12] At the time of signature of this Agreement, the European Economic
  Area, pre-accession agreements to the European Union, the CARICOM
  Single Market and Economy, and the CARICOM-Dominican Republic Free
  Trade Agreement are deemed to fall in their entirety under this
  exception.

  [13] For this calculation official data by the WTO on leading
  exporters in world merchandise trade (excluding intra-EU trade) shall
  be used.

  [14] These core labour standards are further elaborated, in accordance
  with the Declaration, in ILO Conventions concerning freedom of
  association, the elimination of forced labour, the abolition of child
  labour and the elimination of discrimination in the work place.

  [15] National maritime cabotage covers transport services within a
  Signatory CARIFORUM State or within a Member State of the European
  Union for the carriage of passengers or goods originating and
  terminating in that CARIFORUM State or in that Member State.

  [16] At the time of signature of this Agreement, the European Economic
  Area, pre-accession agreements to the European Union, the CARICOM
  Single Market and Economy, and the CARICOM-Dominican Republic Free
  Trade Agreement are deemed to fall in their entirety under this
  exception.

  [17] For this calculation official data by the WTO on leading
  exporters in world merchandise trade (excluding intra-EU trade) shall
  be used.

  [18] The recipient commercial presence may be required to submit a
  training programme covering the duration of the stay for prior
  approval, demonstrating that the purpose of the stay is for training.
  For Spain, France, Germany, Austria and Hungary, training must be
  linked to the university degree which has been obtained.

  [19] The service contract referred to under ((d) and ((e) shall comply
  with the laws, regulations and requirements of the Party or Signatory
  CARIFORUM States where the contract is executed.

  [20] Obtained after having reached the age of majority.

  [21] Where the degree or qualification has not been obtained in the
  Party where the service is supplied, that Party may evaluate whether
  this is equivalent to a university degree required in its territory.

  [22] Where the degree or qualification has not been obtained in the
  Party where the service is supplied, that Party may evaluate whether
  this is equivalent to a university degree required in its territory.

  [23] Such rates are cost-oriented rates in the EC Party, and
  cost-based rates in Signatory CARIFORUM States.

  [24] This Article applies only to financial services activities
  covered by Article 103 and liberalised according to this Title.

  [25] For the purpose of this Section, tourism distribution networks
  means tour operators and other tourism wholesalers (both out-bound and
  in-bound), computer reservation systems and global distribution
  systems (whether or not connected to airlines or provided through the
  Internet), travel agencies and other distributors of tourism services.

  [26] For the purposes of this Article the use of an unlimited number
  of renewable periods of not less than 10 years shall be considered
  indefinite.

  [27] It is understood that there shall be no obligation to apply such
  procedures to imports of goods put on the market in another country by
  or with the consent of the right holder.

  [28] For the purposes of this section, "goods infringing an
  intellectual property right" means.(a)"counterfeit
  goods", namely:(i)goods, including packaging, bearing without
  authorisation a trade mark identical to the trade mark duly registered
  in respect of the same type of goods, or which cannot be distinguished
  in its essential aspects from such a trade mark, and which thereby
  infringes the trade mark holder's rights;(ii)any trade mark symbol
  (logo, label, sticker, brochure, instructions for use or guarantee
  document), even if presented separately, on the same conditions as the
  goods referred to in subparagraph (i);(iii)packaging materials bearing
  the trade marks of counterfeit goods, presented separately, on the
  same conditions as the goods referred to in subparagraph
  (i);(b)"pirated goods", namely goods which are or contain
  copies made without the consent of the holder, or of a person duly
  authorised by the holder in the country of production, of a copyright
  or related right or design right, regardless of whether it is
  registered in national law;(c)goods which, according to the law of the
  EC Party or Signatory CARIFORUM State in which the application for
  customs action is made, infringe:(i)a design;(ii)a geographical
  indication.The EC Party and the Signatory CARIFORUM States agree to
  collaborate to expand the scope of this definition to cover goods
  infringing all intellectual property rights.

  [29] Such standards are those included in the following international
  instruments:(i)Guidelines for the regulation of computerised personal
  data files, modified by the General Assembly of the United Nations on
  20 November 1990;(ii)Recommendation of the Organisation for Economic
  Cooperation and Development Council concerning guidelines governing
  the protection of privacy and trans-border flows of personal data of
  23 September 1980.

  [30] For the purpose of this Article the official languages of the
  CARIFORUM States are Dutch, English, French and Spanish and the
  official languages of the EC Party are those indicated in Article 249.

  [31] The Parties agree that, in accordance with Chapter 5 of Title IV,
  measures necessary to combat child labour shall be deemed to be
  included within the meaning of measures necessary to protect public
  morals or measures necessary for the protection of health.

  [32] Measures that are aimed at ensuring the equitable or effective
  imposition or collection of direct taxes include measures taken by the
  EC Party or a Signatory CARIFORUM State under its taxation system
  which: (i) apply to non-resident investors and services suppliers in
  recognition of the fact that the tax obligation of non-residents is
  determined with respect to taxable items sourced or located in the EC
  Party's or Signatory CARIFORUM State's territory; or (ii) apply to
  non-residents in order to ensure the imposition or collection of taxes
  in the EC Party's or Signatory CARIFORUM State's territory; or (iii)
  apply to non-residents or residents in order to prevent the avoidance
  or evasion of taxes, including compliance measures; or (iv) apply to
  consumers of services supplied in or from the territory of the other
  Party in order to ensure the imposition or collection of taxes on such
  consumers derived from sources in the EC Party's or Signatory
  CARIFORUM State's territory; or (v) distinguish investors and service
  suppliers subject to tax on worldwide taxable items from other
  investors and service suppliers, in recognition of the difference in
  the nature of the tax base between them; or (vi) determine, allocate
  or apportion income, profit, gain, loss, deduction or credit of
  resident persons or branches, or between related persons or branches
  of the same person, in order to safeguard the EC Party's or Signatory
  CARIFORUM State's tax base. Tax terms or concepts in paragraph (h) of
  this provision and in this footnote are determined according to tax
  definitions and concepts, or equivalent or similar definitions and
  concepts, under the domestic law of the EC Party or Signatory
  CARIFORUM State taking the measure.
