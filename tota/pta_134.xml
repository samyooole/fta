  of 27 November 2001

  on the association of the overseas countries and territories with the
  European Community

  ("Overseas Association Decision")

  (2001/822/EC)

  THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,

  Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,
  hereinafter referred to as the Treaty, and in particular Article 187
  thereof,

  Having regard to the proposal from the Commission,

  Whereas:

  (1) Council Decision 91/482/EEC of 25 July 1991 on the association of
  the overseas countries and territories with the European Economic
  Community(1), was applicable until 1 December 2001. Article 240(4)
  thereof states that the Council, acting unanimously on a proposal from
  the Commission, shall establish the provisions to be laid down for the
  subsequent application of the principles set out in Articles 182 to
  186 of the Treaty.

  (2) Declaration No 36 on the overseas countries and territories,
  hereinafter referred to as the "OCTs", annexed to the final
  act of the Conference of the Representatives of the Governments of the
  Member States signed in Amsterdam in 1997, invites the Council, acting
  in accordance with Article 187 of the Treaty, to review the
  association arrangements with the OCTs with a fourfold objective as
  follows:

  - promoting the economic and social development of the OCTs more
  effectively;

  - developing economic relations between the OCTs and the European
  Union;

  - taking greater account of the diversity and specific characteristics
  of the individual OCTs, including aspects relating to freedom of
  establishment;

  - and ensuring that the effectiveness of the financial instrument is
  improved.

  (3) On 11 February 1999 the European Parliament adopted a resolution
  on relations between the OCTs, the ACP States and the outermost
  regions of the European Union(2). Furthermore, on 4 October 2001, it
  adopted a resolution on the proposal from the Commission for a Council
  Decision on the association of the OCTs with the European
  Community(3).

  (4) In its communication of 20 May 1999 entitled "the Status of
  OCTs associated with the EC and options for 'OCT 2000'", the
  Commission examined the features and the development of the OCT-EC
  association since 1957, noted the basic principles and the current
  situation of the association and sketched out alternative policies for
  it for the period beginning 1 March 2000.

  (5) In accordance with Article 10 of Decision 91/482/EEC, the
  competent OCT authorities informed the Commission of the amendments or
  additions they desired in future, notably at a meeting held in the
  context of the partnership on 29 and 30 April 1999, attended by the
  Commission, the four Member States to which the OCTs are linked and
  the 20 OCTs concerned.

  (6) Though not third countries, the OCTs do not form part of the
  single market and must comply with the obligations imposed on third
  countries in respect of trade, notably rules of origin, health and
  plant health standards and safeguard measures.

  (7) As a general rule, when the Council adopts measures under Article
  187 of the Treaty, it must take account both of the principles laid
  down in Part Four of the Treaty and of the other principles of
  Community law. It should also take account of experience acquired in
  the implementation of the trade arrangements of Decision 91/482/EEC.

  (8) These arrangements provide for duty-free access for products
  originating in the OCTs and rules of origin allowing cumulation with
  products originating in the ACP States, which are subject to different
  arrangements, or in the Community. This causes or threatens to cause
  serious disruption to the functioning of certain common market
  organisations under the common agricultural policy, in particular
  those for rice and sugar. Such disruption has on a number of occasions
  led the Commission and the Council to adopt safeguard measures.

  (9) By limiting the scope for use of cumulation of origin, the changes
  made in relation to rice at the mid-term review of the Decision(4)
  have helped maintain access for OCT products to the Community market
  on terms conducive to its balance. This access should be improved in
  respect of the least developed OCTs, but without modifying the overall
  quantity benefiting from cumulation. Given that only two other OCTs
  have ever operated in this sector, the remaining available quantities
  should be allocated to them, in the interest of transparency.

  (10) However, as regards sugar and sugar mixes, the rise in OCT
  exports made from sugar of ACP or Community origin to a heavily
  oversupplied market has resulted in a greater reduction in the quota
  allowed for Community producers and therefore a greater loss of
  guaranteed income for them.

  (11) Moreover, in view of the minimal, low value-added operations that
  currently suffice to obtain the status of a product originating in the
  OCTs in the sugar sector, the contribution of these exports to the
  development of the territories can only be small at best and, without
  a doubt, out of all proportion to the disruption caused to the
  Community sectors concerned.

  (12) For the above reasons, origin rules should therefore be adopted
  which exclude the possibility of ACP/EC-OCT cumulation for sugar when
  only minimal operations are carried out. However, taking into account
  the investments already made in the OCTs on the basis of the rules in
  force since 1991, such exclusion should enter into force in a
  progressive way. Therefore, subject to the adoption of the necessary
  implementing provisions, cumulation should be temporarily allowed to
  continue within progressively decreasing quantitative limits which are
  compatible with the objectives of the Community's common market
  organisation for sugar whilst taking due account of the legitimate
  interests of OCT operators.

  (13) Provision should also be made to ensure that agricultural
  products originating in the Community and which have benefited from an
  export refund cannot be re-imported duty-free into the Community by
  means of the cumulation procedure.

  (14) Furthermore, all the OCT rules of origin should be updated, in
  the interests of the operators and administrations concerned, to take
  account of technical progress and the policy adopted by the Community
  of origin-rule harmonisation. Likewise, the procedure should be
  simplified to enable the necessary technical amendments to the rules
  to be made more easily in future.

  (15) The procedure for the transhipment of goods not originating in
  the OCTs but in free circulation there should be completed and
  clarified, with a view to ensuring a transparent and reliable legal
  framework for operators and administrations. It should also be
  extended to cover certain fishery products of particular importance
  for Greenland and Saint-Pierre-et-Miquelon, subject to the adoption of
  the necessary implementing provisions.

  (16) The general provisions of the Treaty and legislation derived
  thereunder do not automatically apply to the OCTs, barring express
  provisions to the contrary. OCT products imported into the Community
  must nevertheless comply with the Community rules in force.

  (17) Financial assistance to the OCTs should be allocated on the basis
  of uniform, transparent and effective criteria, taking into account
  the needs and performances of the OCTs. Such criteria should include
  in particular the economic and physical dimensions of the OCTs, the
  use made of past allocations, respect for the principles of sound
  financial management, fair fiscal policy, estimated absorption
  capacity, the need for establishing a reserve in order to finance
  non-programmable expenditure and a smooth transition to prevent a
  sudden considerable setback in allocation for New Caledonia, French
  Polynesia and the Netherlands Antilles. In the interests of
  efficiency, simplification and recognition of the management
  capacities of the OCT authorities, the financial resources granted to
  the OCTs should be managed more on the basis of partnership by
  applying procedures based on the rules in force for the structural
  funds.

  (18) For this purpose, the procedures delegate the main responsibility
  for programming and implementing cooperation to the OCTs in
  particular. Cooperation will be conducted predominantly in conformity
  with OCT territorial regulations and will underpin support for the
  monitoring, evaluation and audit of the operations programmed. In
  addition, it is necessary to clarify which Community programmes and
  budget lines are open to the OCTs, as well as the procedures for a
  smooth transition from previous EDFs to the 9th one.

  (19) Global changes, reflected in the continuing process of trade
  liberalisation, broadly implicate the Community, the OCTs' principal
  trading partner, as well as their ACP neighbours and other economic
  partners. In the market access equation, the level of tariffs plays an
  increasingly reduced role while trade in services and trade-related
  areas assume an ever greater importance in the relationship between
  the OCTs and their economic partners. That relationship should
  therefore be fostered, while retaining the broad outline of the
  current trade arrangements, and the conditions for the gradual
  integration of those OCTs who so wish into the regional and global
  economy simplified by helping them to increase their capacity to
  handle all these new areas.

  (20) The measures necessary for the implementation of this Decision
  should be adopted in accordance with Council Decision 1999/468/EC of
  28 June 1999, laying down the procedures for the exercise of
  implementing powers conferred on the Commission(5). However, so far as
  the implementation of the 9th EDF is concerned, the voting and the
  majority should be as laid down in Article 21 of the Internal
  Agreement between the representatives of the Governments of the Member
  States, meeting within the Council, on the financing and
  administration of Community Aid under the Financial Protocol to the
  Partnership Agreement between the African, Caribbean and Pacific
  States and the European Community and its Member States signed in
  Cotonou (Benin) on 23 June 2000 and the allocation of financial
  assistance for the Overseas Countries and Territories to which Part
  Four of the Treaty applies(6), hereinafter the "Internal
  Agreement".

  (21) The OCTs are fragile island environments requiring adequate
  protection, including in respect of waste management. In respect of
  radioactive waste, this is provided under Article 198 of the Euratom
  Treaty and legislation adopted thereunder, except for Greenland, to
  which the Euratom Treaty does not apply. For other waste, it should be
  specified which Community rules are to apply in respect of the OCTs.

  (22) The arrangements for association laid down in this Decision
  should not be applied to Bermuda in accordance with the wishes of the
  Government of Bermuda.

  (23) The Council should produce an innovative response to all the
  above mentioned new factors which is both consistent and tailored to
  the variety of situations. A new status for the association can
  provide such a response,

  HAS DECIDED AS FOLLOWS:
