      <article number="ARTICLE I" article_identifier="17050">The Contracting States, with a view to creating a customs union between 


their respective territories as soon as conditions are favourable, hereby 


agree to establish a free-trade régime which they shall endeavour to perfect


within a period of ten years from the date on which the present Treaty


enters into force. To this end they resolve to abolish, as between their 


territories the customs duties, taxes and regulations hereinafter mentioned 


in respect of the comodities specified in the appended schedule which 


shall constitute Annex A of this Treaty. 


Accordingly, the natural products of the Contracting States and the 


articles manufactured in their territories, provided they are included in 


the aforesaid schedule, shall be exempt from import and export duties as 


well as taxes, duties and charges levied on imports and exports or on the 


occasion of such importation or exportation, whether such duties, taxes 


and charges be of a national, municipal or other nature, and irrespective


of their purpose. 


The exemptions provided for in this article shall not include 


charges for lighterage, docking, warehousing and handling of goods or any


other charges which may legitimately be levied for port, warehouse and 


transport services; nor shall they include exchange differentials resulting


from the existence of two or more rates of exchange or from other exchange


regulations in any of the Contracting States. 


When a commodity or article included in the annexed schedule is 
subject to internal taxes, charges and duties of any kind, levied on 
production, sale, distribution and consumption in any of the Contracting
States, the State concerned may levy an equivalent amount on similar 
commodities imported from another Contracting State.</article>
      <article number="ARTICLE II" article_identifier="17051">Goods originating in the territory of the Contracting States and 
included in the schedule appended to this Treaty shall be accorded national 
treatment in all the Contracting States and shall be exempt from any
restrictions or quantitative measures of control except for.such measures as 
may be legally applicable in the territories of the Contracting States for 
reasons of public health, security or police control.</article>
      <article number="ARTICLE III" article_identifier="17052">Goods originating in one of the Contracting States and which are not 
included in the annexed schedule shall be accorded unconditional and 
unlimited most-favoured-nation treatment in the territory of the other 
Contracting States. 


The above treatment shall not, however, be extended to concessions 
granted pursuant to other free trade treaties concluded between Cent:al 
American States.</article>
      <article number="ARTICLE IV" article_identifier="17053">The Contracting States, convinced of the necessity of equalizing their 
customs tariffs and firmly determined to establish a customs union between 
their territories, undertake, after consideration by the Central American 
Trade Commission mentioned below, to equalize the duties and other charges
imposed by them individually on imports of commodities mentioned in the 
schedule appended hereto or which may be subsequently included in the said 
schedule, and on their main raw materials and containers. 


For the purposes mentioned in the preceding paragraph, the Commission 
shall prepare and submit to the contracting governments, within a period not 
exceeding one year, the draft contractual agreement or agreements for the 
equalization of import duties.</article>
      <article number="ARTICLE V" article_identifier="17054">The Governments of the Contracting States shall endeavour to refrain 
from enjoying or granting customs exemptions on imports from outside 
Central America of articles produced in any one of the Contracting States and 
mentioned in the schedule appended hereto. 


The Contracting States shall further endeavour to equalize the advantages
granted by them to industries manufacturing articles which are mentioned in 
the schedule, to the extent that such advantages might, in the opinion of 
the Central American Trade Commission, entail unfair competition with 
respect to the said commodities.</article>
      <article number="ARTICLE VI" article_identifier="17055">Subject to consideration by the Central American Trade Commission, the 


schedule appended to this Treaty may be extended by mutual agreement between 


the Contracting States, by means of subsequent protocols and in accordance 
with the constitutional procedures of the Contracting States.</article>
      <article number="ARTICLE VII" article_identifier="17056">In order that the goods specified in the schedule appended hereto may
enjoy the advantages deriving from this Treaty, a customs form shall be

customs officers of the countries of origin and of destination for inspection 
as provided for in Annex B of this Treaty.</article>
      <article number="ARTICLE VIII" article_identifier="17057">The Central Banks of the Contracting States shall co-operate closely
with a view to precluding currency speculations that might affect the rates 
of exchange, and maintaining the convertibility of the currencies of the 
respective countries on a basis which, in normal conditions, shall guarantee
the freedom, uniformity and stability of exchange rates. 


Should any of the Contracting States establish quantitative restrictions 
on international monetary transfers, it shall adopt the necessary measures so 
that such restrictions will not affect in a discriminatory manner the other 
States. 


In the case of serious balance-of-payments difficulties which affect or 
might affect monetary and payments relations between the Contracting States, 
the Central American Trade Commission, ex officio or upon request from one of 
the Governments, shall immediately study the problem for the purpose of 
recommending to the Contracting Governments a satisfactory solution that is 
compatible with the multilateral free trade régime.</article>

    <chapter number="CHAPTER II" name="Discriminatory Practices" chapter_identifier="2018">
      <article number="ARTICLE IX" article_identifier="17058">Subject to the provisions of' the bilateral Central American treaties in 
force and to any provisions agreed to in subsequent treaties between 


Central American States, the Contracting States agree to the following
provisions with a view to giving broad application to the principle of nom

discrimination in their trading relations: 



(a) Any commodity which is not included in the schedule appended to 
this Treaty and which is subject to quantitative control measures imposed by

Contracting State or upon exportation to such a territory, be accorded 
treatment no less favourable than that accorded to like commodities of any
other origin or destination; 



(b) No Contracting State shall establish or maintain internal duties, 
taxes or other charges levied on a commodity, whether or not included in the 
appended schedule, originating in the territory of another Contracting
State, nor shall it enact or proscribe regulations regarding the distribution 
or sale of such a commodity, when such charges or regulations place or tend 
to place the said commodity in an unfavourable position with respect to like 
commodities of domestic origin or imported from any other country; 



(c) Should a Contracting State establish or maintain an agency or 
service or grant special privileges to a specific enterprise to deal 

exclusively or principally, permanently or temporarily with the production,
exportation, importation, sale or distribution of a commodity, the said 



State shall grant to the trade of my other Contracting State equitable 
treatment with respect to purchases or sales carried out abroad by the said

act in accordance with private business practice and shall afford the

Contracting State. 


Such transit shall not be subject to withdrawal, discrimination or 
quantitative restrictions. Should there be traffic congestion or any other 
form of force majeure, each Contracting State shall give equitable attention

in transit to the other States. 


Transit operations shall be carried out by the routes prescribed by
law for that purpose and subject to the customs and transit laws and 
regulations applicable in the transit territory.

    <chapter number="CHAPTER IV" name="Import Subsidies Ad Unfair Business Practices" chapter_identifier="2020">
      <article number="ARTICLE XI" article_identifier="17060">No Contracting State shall grant directly or indirectly any subsidy in 
favour of the export of any commodity intended for the territories of the 
other States, or establish or maintain any system resulting in the sale of 
such commodity for export to any other Contracting State at a price lower 
than the comparable price charged for a similar commodity to buyers in the 
domestic market, due allowance being made for differences in the conditions 
of sale, differences in taxation and other differences affecting price 
comparability. 


Any measure which involves the fixing of prices or price discrimination 
in a Contracting State shall be deemed to constitute an indirect export 
subsidy if it involves the establishment of a sales price for a specific 
commodity in the other Contracting States which is lower than that resulting 
from normal competition in the market of the exporting country. 


Tax exemptions or refunds of a general character granted by a Contracting 
State with a view to encouraging the production in its territory of certain 
commodities shall not, however, be deemed to constitute an export subsidy. 


Likewise, exemption from internal taxes on production, sales or 
consumption levied in the exporting country on goods exported to the territory 
of another State shall not be doomed to constitute an export subsidy. Normally 
the differences resulting from the sale of foreign exchange in a free market 
at a rato of excharge higher than the official rate shall not be deemed to be 
an export subsidy; but in case of doubt on the part of one of the Contracting 
States, the matter shall be submitted to the Central American Trade Commission 
for its consideration and opinion.</article>
      <article number="ARTICLE XII" article_identifier="17061">Each Contracting State shall, through the legal means at its disposal, 
prevent the exportation of goods from its territory to the territories of 
other States at a price lower than their normal value if this would jeopardize 
or threaten to jeopardize the production of the other States, or to retard the 
establishment of a domostic or a Central Amorican industry, since exportation 
such circumstances would be inconsistent with the purposes of this Treaty. 


A commodity shall be considered to be exported at a lower price than its 
normal value if the price of the commodity exported is less than: 



(a) 	the comparable value in the ordinary course of trade, for a similar 
commodity when destined for consumption in the exporting country; 
or 



(b) 	the highest comparable price for a similar commodity for export to 
any third country in the ordinary course of trade; or 



(c) 	the cost of production of the commodity in the country of origin 
plus a reasonable addition in respect of the sales cost and profit, 

Due allowance shall be made in each case for differences in conditions 
of sale, differences in taxation and other differences affecting price 
comparabilty.</article>
      <article number="ARTICLE XIII" article_identifier="17062">If, notwithstading the provisions of this chapter, there arises a case 
of unfair business practice, the State affected shall take steps with the
