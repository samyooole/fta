  on trade and trade-related matters between the European Community, of
  the one part, and the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, of the
  other part

  THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITY,

  hereinafter referred to as the "Community",

  of the one part, and

  THE FORMER YUGOSLAV REPUBLIC OF MACEDONIA,

  of the other part,

  WHEREAS:

  (1) The Stabilisation and Association Agreement between the European
  Communities and their Member States, of the one part, and the former
  Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, of the other part, was signed by way
  of Exchange of Letters in Luxembourg on 9 April 2001.

  (2) The Stabilisation and Association Agreement is intended to
  establish a close and lasting relationship based on reciprocity and
  mutual interest, which should allow the former Yugoslav Republic of
  Macedonia to further strengthen and extend the already established
  relationship.

  (3) It is necessary to ensure the development of trade links by
  strengthening and widening the relations established previously,
  notably by the Cooperation Agreement signed on 29 April 1997 by way of
  Exchange of Letters, which entered into force on 1 January 1998.

  (4) To this end it is necessary to implement as speedily as possible,
  by means of an Interim Agreement, provisions of the Stabilisation and
  Association Agreement on trade and trade related matters.

  (5) It is necessary to ensure that pending the entry into force of the
  Stabilisation and Association Agreement and the establishment of the
  Stabilisation and Association Council, the Cooperation Council set up
  by the Cooperation Agreement can exercise the powers assigned by the
  Stabilisation and Association Agreement to the Stabilisation and
  Association Council, which are necessary in order to implement the
  Interim Agreement,

  HAVE DECIDED to conclude this Agreement and to this end have
  designated as their Plenipotentiaries:

  preferential arrangements governing the movement of goods either laid
  down in frontier agreements previously concluded between one or more
  Member States and the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia and
  succeeded to by the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia or resulting
  from the bilateral agreements concluded by the former Yugoslav
  Republic of Macedonia in order to promote regional trade.

  3. Consultations between the Parties shall take place within the
  Cooperation Council concerning the agreements described in paragraphs
  1 and 2 of this Article and, where requested, on other major issues
  related to their respective trade policies towards third countries. In
  particular in the event of a third country acceding to the Community,
  such consultations shall take place so as to ensure that account is
  taken of the mutual interests of the Community and the former Yugoslav
  Republic of Macedonia stated in this Agreement.</article>
      <article number="ARTICLE 23" name="Dumping" article_identifier="7600">1. If one of the Parties finds that dumping is taking place in trade
  with the other Party within the meaning of Article VI of the GATT
  1994, it may take appropriate measures against this practice in
  accordance with the Agreement on implementation of Article VI of the
  GATT 1994 and its own related internal legislation.

  2. As regards paragraph 1 of this Article, the Cooperation Council
  shall be informed of the dumping case as soon as the authorities of
  the importing Party have initiated an investigation. When no end has
  been put to the dumping within the meaning of Article VI of the GATT
  or no other satisfactory solution has been reached within 30 days of
  the matter being referred to the Cooperation Council, the importing
  Party may adopt the appropriate measures.</article>
      <article number="ARTICLE 24" name="General Safeguard Clause" article_identifier="7601">1. Where any product of one Party is being imported into the territory
  of the other Party in such increased quantities and under such
  conditions as to cause or threaten to cause:

  - serious injury to the domestic industry of like or directly
  competitive products in the territory of the importing Party; or

  - serious disturbances in any sector of the economy or difficulties
  which could bring about serious deterioration in the economic
  situation of a region of the importing Party,

  the importing Party may take appropriate measures under the conditions
  and in accordance with the procedures laid down in this Article.

  2. The Community and the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia shall
  only apply safeguard measures between themselves in accordance with
  the provisions of this Agreement. Such measures shall not exceed what
  is necessary to remedy the difficulties which have arisen, and should
  normally consist of the suspension of the further reduction of any
  applicable rate of duty provided for under this Agreement for the
  product concerned or the increase of the rate of duty for that
  product.

  Such measures shall contain clear elements progressively leading to
  their elimination at the end of the set period, at the latest.
  Measures shall not be taken for a period exceeding one year. In very
  exceptional circumstances, measures may be taken up to a total maximum
  period of three years. No safeguard measure shall be applied to the
  import of a product that has previously been subject to such a measure
  for a period of, at least, three years since the expiry of the
  measure.

  3. In the cases specified in this Article, before taking the measures
  provided for therein or, in the cases to which paragraph 4(b) of this
  Article applies, as soon as possible, the Community or the former
  Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, as the case may be, shall supply the
  Cooperation Council with all relevant information, with a view to
  seeking a solution acceptable to the two Parties.

  4. For the implementation of the above paragraphs the following
  provisions shall apply:

  (a) The difficulties arising from the situation referred to in this
  Article shall be referred for examination to the Cooperation Council,
  which may take any decisions needed to put an end to such
  difficulties. If the Cooperation Council or the exporting Party has
  not taken a decision putting an end to the difficulties or no other
  satisfactory solution has been reached within 30 days of the matter
  being referred to the Cooperation Council, the importing Party may
  adopt the appropriate measures to remedy the problem in accordance
  with this Article. In the selection of safeguard measures priority
  must be given to those which least disturb the functioning of the
  arrangements established in this Agreement.

  (b) Where exceptional and critical circumstances requiring immediate
  action make prior information or examination, as the case may be,
  impossible, the Party concerned may, in the situations specified in
  this Article, apply forthwith precautionary measures necessary to deal
  with the situation and shall inform the other Party immediately
  thereof.

  5. The safeguard measures shall be notified immediately to the
  Cooperation Council and shall be the subject of periodic consultations
  within that body, particularly with a view to establishing a timetable
  for their abolition as soon as circumstances permit.

  6. In the event of the Community or the former Yugoslav Republic of
  Macedonia subjecting imports of products liable to give rise to the
  difficulties referred to in this Article to an administrative
  procedure having at its purpose the rapid provision of information on
  the trend of trade flows, it shall inform the other Party.</article>
      <article number="ARTICLE 25" name="Shortage Clause" article_identifier="7602">1. Where compliance with the provisions of this Title leads to:

  (a) a critical shortage, or threat thereof, of foodstuffs or other
  products essential to the exporting Party; or

  (b) re-export to a third country of a product against which the
  exporting Party maintains quantitative export restrictions, export
  duties or measures or charges having equivalent effect, and where the
  situations referred to above give rise, or are likely to give rise to
  major difficulties for the exporting Party, that Party may take
  appropriate measures under the conditions and in accordance with the
  procedures laid down in this Article.

  2. In the selection of measures, priority must be given to those which
  least disturb the functioning of the arrangements in this Agreement.
  Such measures shall not be applied in a manner which would constitute
  a means of arbitrary or unjustifiable discrimination where the same
  conditions prevail, or a disguised restriction on trade and shall be
  eliminated when the conditions no longer justify their maintenance.

  3. Before taking the measures provided for in paragraph 1 of this
  Article or, as soon as possible in cases to which paragraph 4 of this
  Article applies, the Community or the former Yugoslav Republic of
  Macedonia, as the case may be, shall supply the Cooperation Council
  with all relevant information, with a view to seeking a solution
  acceptable to the Parties. The Parties within the Cooperation Council
  may agree on any means needed to put an end to the difficulties. If no
  agreement is reached within 30 days of the matter being referred to
  the Cooperation Council, the exporting Party may apply measures under
  this Article on the exportation of the product concerned.

  4. Where exceptional and critical circumstances requiring immediate
  action make prior information or examination, as the case may be,
  impossible, the Community or the former Yugoslav Republic of
  Macedonia, whichever is concerned, may apply forthwith the
  precautionary measures necessary to deal with the situation and shall
  inform the other Party immediately thereof.

  5. Any measures applied pursuant to this Article shall be immediately
  notified to the Cooperation Council and shall be the subject of
  periodic consultations within that body, particularly with a view to
  establishing a timetable for their elimination as soon as
  circumstances permit.</article>

  States and of the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia. The
  Cooperation Council shall be informed about the measures adopted to

  and life of humans, animals or plants; the protection of national
  treasures of artistic, historic or archaeological value or the
  protection of intellectual, industrial and commercial property, or

  there is sufficient evidence of fraud such as a significant increase
  in trade of products by one Party to the other Party, beyond the level
  reflecting economic conditions such as normal production and export
  capacities, or failure to provide administrative cooperation as
  required for the verification of evidence of origin by the other
  Party, both Parties shall enter into consultations immediately to find
  an appropriate solution. Pending such solution, the Party concerned
  may take the appropriate measures it deems necessary. In the selection
  of the measure priority must be given to those which least disturb the
  functioning of the arrangements established in this Agreement.</article>

  conditions established under the WTO Agreement, adopt restrictive
  measures, including measures relating to imports, which shall be of

  3. (a) For the purposes of applying the provisions of paragraph
  1(iii), the Parties recognise that during the first four years after
  the entry into force of this Agreement, any public aid granted by the
  former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia shall be assessed taking into
  account the fact that the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia shall
  be regarded as an area identical to those areas of the Community
  described in Article 87(3)(a) of the Treaty establishing the European
  Community.

  (b) Each Party shall ensure transparency in the area of public aid,
  inter alia by reporting annually to the other Party on the total
  amount and the distribution of the aid given and by providing, upon
  request, information on aid schemes. Upon request by one Party, the
  other Party shall provide information on particular individual cases
  of public aid.

  Each Party shall ensure that the provisions of this Article are

  considers that a particular practice is incompatible with the terms of
  paragraph 1, and:

  - if such practice causes or threatens to cause serious injury to the
  interests of the other Party or material injury to its domestic
  industry, including its services industry, it may take appropriate
  measures after consultation within the Cooperation Council or after 30
  working days following referral for such consultation.

  In the case of practices incompatible with paragraph 1(iii), such
  appropriate measures may, where the WTO Agreement applies thereto,
  only be adopted in accordance with the procedures and under the
  conditions laid down thereby or the relevant Community internal
  legislation.
