establishment of a Free-Trade Area among Latin American countries 


Persuaded that the expansion of present national markets, through the 


gradual elimination of barriers to intra-regional trade, is a prerequisite


if the Iatin American countries are to accelerate their economic development


prooess;.In such a way as to ensure a higher. level of living for their 


peoples 


Aware that economic development should be attained through the maximum 
utilization of available production factors and the more effective coordination of the development programmes of the different production sectors 
in accordance with norms which take due account of the interests of each.

for the special situation of countries which are at a relatively less advanced 
stage of economic development, 


Convinced that the strengthening of national economies will contribute 


to the expansion of trade within Latin America and with the rest of the world 


Sure that, by the adoption of suitable formulas,, conditions can be' 
created that will be conducive to the gradual and smooth adaptation of existing
productive activities to new patterns of reciprocal trade, and -that further 
incentives will thereby be provided for the improvement and expansion of such


trade 


dertain that any action to achieve such ends must take into account the 
commitments arising out of the international instruments which govern
their trade, 


Determined to persevere in their efforts to establish, gradually and 
progressively, a Latin American common market and, hence, to continue 


collaborating with the Latin American Governments as a whole in the work

complementarity and integration of their national economies on the basis of
