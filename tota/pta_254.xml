AND EL SALVADOR 


The Government of the Republic of Nicaragua and the Government of the 
Republic of El Salvador, desirous of strengthening the traditional bonds of 
fraternal friendship which exist between the two countries and of developing 
still further and to their mutual advantage their trade relations, have 
decided to conclude a free-trade treaty and have, for this purpose, appointed 
as their respective plenipotentiaries: 


For His Excellency the President of the Republic of Nicaragua, 


The Nicaraguan Minister of Foreign Affairs; 


For His Excellency the President of the Republic of El Salvador, 


The Minister of Foreign Affairs of El Salvador; 


Who, after having exchanged their respective credentials and found them in 
order, have agreed upon the following provisions.</article>
    </chapter>
    <chapter number="CHAPTER I" name="Trade Regime" chapter_identifier="2432">
      <article number="ARTICLE I" article_identifier="20313">The Contracting Parties hereby declare their intention of establishing 
at some future time a free-trade area by abolishing the customs duties and 
other trade restrictions applicable to the majority of products originating 
in the two countries. 


Provisionally, and pending the uniformization of the customs tariffs 
between the two countries, the signatories hereby decide to adopt a system
of commodity lists to which the benefits of this Treaty shall immediately
apply.</article>
      <article number="ARTICLE II" article_identifier="20314">The goods originating in the signatory countries, enumerated in the 
attached schedule constituting Annex A to this Treaty (on condition that these 
consist of natural products of these countries or articles manufactured 
mainly from raw materials of either of them). shall be exempt, in both 


countries, fran consular fees, and all taxes, charges, surtaxes, fees or 
dues of a fiscal or local character, due or levied in connection with imports, 
exports, or the transfer from one country to the other of funds intended 
for the payment of imports or exports. 


It is stipulated, however, that the exemptions contemplated in the 


preceding paragraph shall not apply to anchorage dues, charges for lighterage,


handling or warehousing goods, or to the fees imposed by other port or 


transport services, which are legally due in the territories of the signatory 


States. It is also agreed that if one of the goods enumerated in the 


annexed schedule is liable to internal taxes or duties on the manufacture,


sale, or consumption of goods in one of the signatory countries, that 


country shall be entitled to levy equivalent taxes or duties on similar 


commodities imported from the other country.</article>
      <article number="ARTICLE III" article_identifier="20315">Ordinary goods originating from the territories of the Contracting 


Parties shall, if they figure in the schedule annexed to this Treaty, be 


exempt from any measure of quantitative control in either of the States in 


question, without prejudice, however, to compliance with the formalities 
applicable to foreign trade in each of these territories or to any measures 
of control applied for hygiene or police reasons. 


Notwithstanding the above, goods in respect of which the Contracting 
Parties have expressly reserved their right to adopt measures of total or 
partial control on importation or exportation, shall be excepted from this 
provision. Such commodities are indicated in the annexed list by an 
asterisk followed by an explanatory note specifying the scope of the 
measures in question. 


In the event of one of the Contracting Parties proposing to adopt 
measures for the quantitative control of imports or exports, as specified 
in the preceding paragraph, the said State shall proceed in such a way as 
to reduce to a minimum the unfavourable consequences which such measures 
might have on the economy of the other State, and shall authorize the normal 
completion of current transactions which have been duly verified, For this 
purpose, the said State shall at the appropriate time, furnish the other 
State with detailed particulars on this matters so as to enable the two 
Governments to coordinate their respective action. 


The putting into force, modification or cancellation of the measures 
of quantitative control provided for in paragraph 2 of this Article, shall 
immediately be communicated to the other State by a note.</article>
      <article number="ARTICLE IV" article_identifier="20316">The schedule which figures in Annex A to this Treaty may be lengthened, 
shortened, 


or modified by mutual agreement between the two Governments, by 


an exchange of notes, provided that the relevant constitutional provisions 


of the two respective States have previously been complied with.</article>
      <article number="ARTICLE V" article_identifier="20317">The two Contracting Parties, with the firm intention of establishing a 
customs union between their respective territories, mutually agree that any 
addition to the annexed schedule shall be preceded, whenever this is possible, 
by a comparison of the taxes and duties levied by each of the Contracting 
Parties on the importation of similar goods from countries other than those 
which formerly constituted the Federation of Central America. 


In the case of goods in the manufacture or packing of which raw materials 
of foreign origin are used, the above-mentioned comparison of customs duties 
shall also apply to such raw materials or packing.</article>
      <article number="ARTICLE VI" article_identifier="20318">In order to ensure that the goods figuring in the annexed schedule 


shall enjoy the advantages specified in this Treaty, they must be accompanied


by a customs declaration, signed by the exporter and containing a certificate 


of origin, and which will be subject to the visa and approval of the customs 


authorities of both countries, in accordance with the provisions of Annex B 


of this Treaty.</article>
      <article number="ARTICLE VII" article_identifier="20319">The goods which do not figure in the annexed schedule, but which

regards everything which concerns customs and subsidiary duties the methods 
for recoveringsuch duties, and the rules, formalities and charges connected 
with customs operations, as well as all or any measures for the control of 
means of payment and for regulating the international transfer of funds. 


It shall, nevertheless, be agreed that most-favoured-nation treatment,

a regime rendering it possible to sell a given commodity, for the purpose of 
export to another country, at a price lower than that fixed for the sale 
of that commodity in the home market, with due allowance for the existing
differences in selling conditions and the charges to which it is liable, or 
any other factors which enter into a comparison of prices. 


Any practice prevailing in either of the Signatory States which 
consists in fixing prices or enforcing price discrimination, and which 
would take the form of fixing the selling price of a given commodity in 
the other State at rates lower than those normally resulting from the free 
play of the supply and demand of that commodity in the exporting country,
shall be deemed an indirect export subsidy..

of the signatory countries for the purpose of developing production shall 
not be deemed subsidies.</article>

the objects of this Treaty, each of the signatory States shall avoid, with 


the aid of the legal machinery at its disposal, from exporting the commodi

ties 	of the said State to the territory of the other State at prices below 


their 	normal value, in such a way as to cause prejudice or to threaten to 


cause 	prejudice to the interests of any industry established within the 


territory of the other State, or which would delay the creation of a national 


industry, Any commodity shall be deemed to have been exported at a price 


below 	the normal value if the price of that commodity:

of a similar commodity intended for consumption in the home market

(b) 	in default of such a price in the home market, is lower than: 

(i) 	the highest comparable price, for export to a third country, 


of a 	similar commodity, under normal trade conditions, or, 


(ii) 	the cost of producing such a commodity in the country of 
origin, plus a reasonable percentage to cover selling costs 
and profits.

of sale and taxation, including any other differences which might affect 
the comparative price,</article>

subsidies which might be granted in either of the signatory countries, or 


the effects of the above mentioned reprehensible practice of dumping, the 
State which is thereby prejudiced shall be entitled to impose countervailing 
customs duties, up to the limit of the amount required to lower the 
difference or the artificial price margin occasioned by the subsidies or 
the above-mentioned practices, provided that the other contracting State 
shall previously have been notified.</article>
