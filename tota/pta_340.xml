MERCOSUR AND THE REPUBLIC OF INDIA 


The Argentine Republic, the Federative Republic of Brazil, the Republic of Paraguay and the República Oriental del Uruguay, States Parties to the MERCOSUR, and the Republic of India: 
CONSIDERING 

That the Framework Agreement for the creation of a Free Trade Area between MERCOSUR and the Republic of India provides for a first stage of action aimed at increasing trade, including the mutual granting of tariff preferences; 

That implementation of an instrument providing for the granting of fixed tariff preferences during said first stage would facilitate subsequent negotiations for the creation of a Free Trade Area; 

That the negotiations needed to implement the granting of fixed tariff preferences and to establish trade disciplines between the Parties have been conducted; 

That regional integration and trade among developing countries, including through the creation of free trade areas, are compatible with the multilateral trading system, and contribute to the expansion of world trade, to the integration of their economies into the global economy, and to the social and economic development of their peoples; 

That the process of integrating their economies includes the gradual and reciprocal liberalization of trade and the strengthening of economic cooperation amongst them;  

That Article 27 of the Treaty of Montevideo 1980, of which the MERCOSUR Member States are signatory Parties, authorizes the conclusion of Partial Scope Agreements with other developing countries and economic integration areas outside Latin America;
