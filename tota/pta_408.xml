Where there is disagreement between the Parties as to whether the Party complained against eliminated the non-conformity or the nullification or impairment in the sense of Article 17.1 (c) as determined in the report of the arbitral panel within the reasonable period of time as determined pursuant to paragraph 3, either Party may refer the matter to an arbitral panel as provided for in Article 17.12.7.</article>
      <article number="ARTICLE 17.12" name="Non-Implementation – Compensation And Suspension Of Concessions Or Other Obligations" article_identifier="35107">1. If the Party complained against notifies the complaining Party that it is impracticable, or the arbitral panel to which the matter is referred pursuant to Article 17.11.4 confirms that the Party complained against has failed, to eliminate the non-conformity with this Agreement or the nullification or impairment in the sense of Article 17.1 (c) as determined in the final report of 

227 

the arbitral panel within the reasonable period of time as determined pursuant to Article 17.11.3, the Party complained against shall, if so requested, enter into negotiations with the complaining Party with a view to reaching mutually satisfactory compensation. 


2. If there is no agreement on satisfactory compensation within 20 days after the date of receipt of the request mentioned in paragraph 1, the complaining Party may suspend the application to the Party complained against of concessions or other obligations under this Agreement, after giving notification of such suspension 30 days in advance.

(a) 	the complaining Party should first seek to suspend concessions or other obligations with respect to the same sector(s) as that in which the final report of the arbitral panel referred to in Article 

17.10 has found the non-conformity with this Agreement or the nullification or impairment of benefits in the sense of Article 

17.1 (c); and 

(b) 	if the complaining Party considers that it is not practicable or effective to suspend concessions or other obligations with respect to the same sector(s), it may suspend concessions or other obligations with respect to other sectors. The notification of such suspension pursuant to paragraph 2 shall indicate the reasons on which it is based. 

5. The level of suspension referred to in paragraph 2 shall be equivalent to the level of the nullification or impairment. 


6. If the Party complained against considers that the requirements for the suspension of concessions or other obligations by the complaining Party set 
228 

out in paragraph 2, 3, 4 or 5 have not been met, it may refer the matter to an 

arbitral panel. 

7. The arbitral panel that is established for the purposes of this Article or Article 17.11 shall have, wherever possible, as its panelists, the panelists of the original arbitral panel. If this is not possible, then the panelists to the arbitral panel that is established for the purposes of this Article or Article 17.11 shall be appointed pursuant to Article 17.7. The arbitral panel established for the purposes of this Article or Article 17.11 shall issue its report within 60 days after the date when the matter is referred to it. When the arbitral panel considers that it cannot issue its report within the aforementioned 60-day period, it may extend that period for a maximum of 30 days with the consent of the Parties. The report shall be made available to the public within 15 days after the date of issuance, subject to the requirement to protect confidential information.
