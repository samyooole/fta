Cooperative activities will be agreed between the Parties and may include, but should not be limited to exchange of people and information; cooperation in regional and multilateral fora; dialogues, conferences and seminars; the development of joint research programs; and the encouragement of private sector cooperation. 


7. The objectives of both Parties in Labor Cooperation will be to promote decent work, sound labor policies and practices of each Party’s labor systems, improve the capacities and capabilities of the Parties and the development and management of human capital for enhanced employability, business excellence and greater productivity for the benefit of workers and employers, in the context of strengthening trade and investment relations between them. 
The Parties reaffirm their obligations as members of the International Labor Organization (ILO) and their commitments under the ILO Declaration on Fundamental Principles and Rights at Work and its Follow-up (1998). Each Party shall strive to ensure that the principles embodied in such declaration and the internationally recognized labor rights are included and protected by its domestic laws and agree to cooperate on labor and employment matters of mutual interest and benefit, through jointly decided activities which may refer, among others, to: 

a) 	decent work, including its dimensions of employment, labor standards, social protection and social dialogue; 

b) 	compliance and enforcement systems and management of labor disputes; and 

c) 	employment systems, human capital development, training and employability. 

The Parties recognize that it is inappropriate to encourage trade or investment by weakening or reducing the protections afforded in domestic labor laws. Accordingly, a Party shall not fail to effectively enforce its labor laws, in a manner affecting trade between the Parties. 

8. The Parties recognize the importance of strengthening capacity to protect the environment and promote sustainable development in concert with strengthening trade and investment relations between them. 

The Parties reaffirm their intention to continue to pursue environmental protection, and to fulfill their respective multilateral environment commitments. 

The Parties endeavor to have their environment laws, regulations, policies and practices in harmony with their international environment commitments; agree that it is inappropriate to set or use their environmental laws, regulations, policies and practices for trade protectionist purposes; as well as it is inappropriate to relax, or fail to enforce or administer, their environment laws and regulations to encourage trade and investment. 

The Parties agree to cooperate in the field of the environment. The aim of cooperation will be the prevention and/or reduction of contamination and degradation of natural resources and ecosystems, and rational use of the latter; through developing and endorsing special programs and projects dealing, inter alia, with the transfer of knowledge and technology. 

Cooperation on environment may include, but should not be limited to: 

a) 	climate change; 

b) 	biodiversity and conservation of natural resources; 

c) 	management of hazardous chemicals; 

d) 	air quality; 

e) 	water management; 

f) 	waste management; 

g) 	marine and coastal ecological conservation and pollution control; 

h) 	strategic environmental impact assessment; 

i) 	improvement of environmental awareness, including environmental education and public participation. 


9. New areas of cooperation may be developed through existing agreements and through appropriate implementing arrangements. 


10. For the purposes of this Title, the Joint Committee may decide to establish sub-committees or working groups. 


11. Communications regarding the implementation of this Title shall be distributed through the contact points designated by each Party before the first meeting of the Joint Committee.
