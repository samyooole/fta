4. Each Party shall endeavour to allocate and assign spectrum for non-government telecommunications services in a transparent manner that considers the overall public interest, including the encouragement of the economically efficient use of the spectrum and competition among suppliers of telecommunications services, recognising that a Party may encourage such activities through a variety of means, including through administrative incentive pricing, auctions, unlicensed use, or inviting for bidding, etc.</article>
