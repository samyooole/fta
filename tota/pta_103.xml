      <article article_identifier="9681">AGREEMENT between the European Community, of the one part, and the
  Government of Denmark and the Home Government of the Faroe Islands, of
  the other part

  THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITY,

  of the one part, and

  THE GOVERNMENT OF DENMARK AND THE HOME GOVERNMENT OF THE FAROE
  ISLANDS,

  of the other part,

  RECALLING the status of the Faeroes as a self-governing integral part
  of one of the Member States of the Community;

  RECALLING the resolution of the Council of 4 February 1974 on the
  problems of the Faeroes;

  CONSIDERING the vital importance for the Faeroes of fisheries, which
  constitute their essential economic activity, fish and fishery
  products being their main export articles;

  CONSIDERING the importance of the fisheries relationship laid down in
  the Agreement on fisheries between the Contracting Parties, who
  confirm that the trade aspects of this Agreement should not affect the
  functioning of the Fisheries Agreement and that, consequently, the
  volume of the mutual fisheries possibilities under that Agreement
  should continue to be maintained at a satisfactory level;

  DESIRING to consolidate and to extend the economic relations existing
  between the Community and the Faeroes and to ensure, with due regard
  for fair conditions of competition, the harmonious development of
  their commerce for the purpose of contributing to the work of
  constructing Europe;

  RESOLVED progressively to eliminate the obstacles to substantially all
  their trade, in accordance with the provisions of the General
  Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) 1994 concerning the
  establishment of free trade areas;

  DECLARING their readiness to examine, in the light of any relevant
  factor, and in particular of developments in the Community, the
  possibility of developing and deepening their relations where it would
  appear to be useful in the interests of their economies to extend them
  to fields not covered by this Agreement;

  CONSIDERING that, to this end, an Agreement between the European
  Economic Community, of the one part, and the Government of Denmark and
  the Home Government of the Faroe Islands, of the other part (hereafter
  referred to as the 'initial Agreement`) was signed on 2 December 1991;

  CONSIDERING that an Agreement in the form of an Exchange of Letters
  between the European Community, of the one part, and the Government of
  Denmark and the Home Government of the Faroe Islands, of the other
  part, amending Tables I and II of the Annex to Protocol 1 of the
  initial Agreement (hereafter referred to as the 'Agreement in the form
  of an Exchange of Letters`) was signed on 8 March 1995;

  CONSIDERING that, pursuant to the accession of the Republic of
  Austria, the Republic of Finland and the Kingdom of Sweden to the
  European Union on 1 January 1995, the arrangements applicable to trade
  in fish and fishery products between the Faeroes and the Community
  should be adjusted in order to maintain trade flows between the
  Faeroes, on the one hand, and the new Member States, on the other;

  CONSIDERING that, as a result of the adoption by the Community of a
  common definition of origin for petroleum products, it is necessary to
  make adjustments to the provisions affecting these products;

  CONSIDERING that, in order to take account of certain developments in
  trade between the Community and the Member States of EFTA, it is
  necessary to make adjustments to the provisions concerning the
  definition of the concept of 'originating products` and methods of
  administrative cooperation;

  CONSIDERING that, in order to take account of the specific production
  of fish feed on the Faeroes, it is necessary to make adjustments to
  the provisions applicable to imports of certain agricultural products;

  CONSIDERING that, in order to help ensure its correct functioning, a
  Protocol on mutual administrative assistance in customs matters should
  be incorporated into this Agreement;

  CONSIDERING that, in order to conform with certain modifications to
  the nomenclature of the customs tariffs of the Contracting Parties
  affecting products referred to in the initial Agreement, it is
  necessary to update the tariff nomenclature of these products;

  CONSIDERING that, in order to provide for more flexibility, it is
  appropriate to empower the Joint Committee to decide on amendments to
  the provisions of the Protocols to this Agreement;

  CONSIDERING that, for the sake of clarity, the initial Agreement and
  the Agreement in the form of an Exchange of Letters should be replaced
  by a composite new text in the form of this Agreement;

  TAKING INTO ACCOUNT that the bilateral trade Agreements between
  Finland and Sweden and the Faeroes cease to be in force on the entry
  into force of this Agreement;

  HAVE DECIDED, in pursuit of these objectives and considering that no
  provisions of this Agreement may be interpreted as exempting the
  Contracting Parties from the obligations which are incumbent on them
  under other international agreements,

  TO CONCLUDE THIS AGREEMENT:</article>

      <article number="ARTICLE 26" article_identifier="9707">Where an increase in imports of a given product is or is likely to be
  seriously detrimental to any production activity carried on in the

  due to:

  (i) the partial or total reduction in the importing Contracting Party,
  as provided for in this Agreement, of customs duties and charges
  having equivalent effect levied on the product in question; and

  (ii) the fact that the duties or charges having equivalent effect
  levied by the exporting Contracting Party on imports of raw materials
  or intermediate products used in the manufacture of the product in
  question are significantly lower than the corresponding duties or
  charges levied by the importing Contracting Party:

  the Contracting Party concerned may take appropriate measures under

      <article number="ARTICLE 29" article_identifier="9710">1. In the event of a Contracting Party subjecting imports of products
  liable to give rise to the difficulties referred to in Articles 26 and
  28 to an administrative procedure, the purpose of which is to provide
  rapid information on the trend of trade flows, it shall inform the
  other Contracting Party.

  2. In the cases specified in Articles 24 to 28, before taking the
  measures provided for therein or, in cases to which paragraph 3 (d) of
  this Article applies, as soon as possible, the Contracting Party in
  question shall supply the Joint Committee with all relevant
  information required for a thorough examination of the situation with
  a view to seeking a solution acceptable to the Contracting Parties.

  In the selection of measures, priority must be given to those which
  least disturb the functioning of this Agreement.

  The safeguard measures shall be notified immediately to the Joint
  Committee and shall be the subject of periodical consultations within
  the Committee, particularly with a view to their abolition as soon as
  circumstances permit.

  3. For the implementation of paragraph 2, the following provisions
  shall apply:

  (a) as regards Article 25, either Contracting Party may refer the
  matter to the Joint Committee if it considers that a given practice is

  meaning of Article 25 (1).

  The Contracting Parties shall provide the Joint Committee with all
  relevant information and shall give it the assistance it requires in
  order to examine the case and, where appropriate, to eliminate the
  practice objected to.

  If the Contracting Party in question fails to put an end to the
  practice objected to within the period fixed by the Joint Committee,
  or in the absence of agreement in the Joint Committee within three
  months of the matter being referred to it, the Contracting Party
  concerned may adopt any safeguard measures it considers necessary to
  deal with the serious difficulties resulting from the practices in
  question; in particular it may withdraw tariff concessions;

  (b) as regards Article 26, the difficulties arising from the situation
  referred to in that Article shall be referred for examination to the
  Joint Committee, which may take any decision needed to put an end to
  such difficulties.

  If the Joint Committee or the exporting Contracting Party has not
  taken a decision putting an end to the difficulties within 30 days of
  the matter being referred, the importing Contracting Party is
  authorized to levy a compensatory charge on the product imported.

  The compensatory charge shall be calculated according to the incidence
  on the value of the goods in question of the tariff disparities in
  respect of the raw materials or intermediate products incorporated
  therein;

  (c) as regards Article 27, consultation in the Joint Committee shall
  take place before the Contracting Party concerned takes the
  appropriate measures;

  (d) where exceptional circumstances requiring immediate action make
  prior examination impossible, the Contracting Party concerned may, in
  the situations specified in Articles 26, 27 and 28 and also in the
  case of export aids having a direct and immediate incidence on trade,
  apply forthwith the precautionary measures strictly necessary to
  remedy the situation.</article>
      <article number="ARTICLE 30" article_identifier="9711">Where one or more Member States of the Community or the Faeroes is in
  difficulties or is seriously threatened with difficulties as regards
  its balance of payments, the Contracting Party concerned may take the
  necessary safeguard measures. It shall inform the other Contracting
  Party forthwith.</article>
      <article number="ARTICLE 31" article_identifier="9712">1. A Joint Committee is hereby established which shall be responsible
  for the administration of this Agreement and shall ensure its proper

  Contracting Parties shall exchange information and, at the request of

  Party.

  The Contracting Parties may instruct the Joint Committee to examine
  this request and, where appropriate, to make recommendations to them,
  particularly with a view to opening negotiations.
