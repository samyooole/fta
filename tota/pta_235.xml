These measures must not exceed the scope of what is necessary to remedy the difficulties which have arisen. 

(b) 	As regards Article 30, the Association Council shall be informed of the instance of dumping as soon as the authorities of the importing party have initiated an investigation.

(c) 	As regards Article 32, the difficulties arising from the situations referred to in that Article shall be referred for examination to the Association Council. 

The Association Council may take any decision needed to put an end to the difficulties. If it has not taken such a decision within thirty days of the matter being referred to it, the exporting party may apply appropriate measures to the export of the product concerned. 

(d) 	Where exceptional circumstances requiring immediate action make prior information or examination, as the case may be, impossible, the Community or Slovenia whichever is concerned may, in the situations specified in Articles 30, 31 and 32, apply forthwith the safeguard measures strictly necessary to deal with the situation and inform the Association Council immediately.</article>
