(1) Licensing fees do not include payments for auction, tendering or other non-discriminatory means of awarding concessions, or mandated contributions to universal service provision. 


(b) obligation on a vertically integrated company to make transparent its wholesale prices and its internal transfer prices, where there is a requirement for non-discrimination or for prevention of unfair cross-subsidy. The regulatory authority may specify the format and accounting methodology to be used; 


(c) obligations to meet reasonable requests for access to, and use of, specific network elements and associated facilities including unbundled access to the local loop, inter alia, in situations where the regulatory authority considers that denial of access or unreasonable terms and conditions having a similar effect would hinder the emergence of a sustainable competitive market at the retail level, or would not be in the end-user's interest; 


(d) obligation to provide specified services 	on a wholesale basis for resale by third parties; to grant open access to technical interfaces, protocols or other key technologies that are indispensable for the interoperability of services or virtual network services; to provide co-location or other forms of facility sharing, including cable duct, building or mast sharing; to provide specified services needed to ensure interoperability of end-to-end services to users, including facilities for intelligent network services; to provide access to operational support systems or similar software systems necessary to ensure fair competition in the provision of services; to interconnect networks or network facilities. 

Regulatory authorities may attach conditions including fairness, reasonableness and timeliness to the obligations included under points (c) and (d) of this paragraph; 

(e) obligations relating to cost recovery and price controls, including obligations for cost orientation of prices and obligations concerning cost accounting systems, for the provision of specific types of interconnection and/or access, in situations where a market analysis indicates that a lack of effective competition means that the operator concerned might sustain prices at an excessively high level, or apply a price squeeze, to the detriment of end-users; 

Regulatory authorities shall take into account the investment made by the operator and allow him a reasonable rate of return on adequate capital employed. 

(f) 	obligation to publish the specific obligations imposed on a service supplier by the regulatory authority identifying the specific product/service and geographical markets. Up-to-date information, provided that it is not confidential and does not comprise business secrets is to be made publicly available in a manner that guarantees all interested parties easy access to that information; 


(g) obligations of transparency requiring operators to make public specified information and in particular, where 	an operator has obligations of non-discrimination, the regulator may require that operator to publish a reference offer, which shall be sufficiently unbundled to ensure that service suppliers are not required to pay for facilities which are not necessary for the service requested, giving a description of the relevant offerings broken down into components according to market needs, and the associated terms and conditions including prices. 
4. The Parties shall ensure that a service supplier requesting interconnection with a service supplier designated as having significant market power shall have recourse, either at any time or after a reasonable period of time which has been made publicly known, to an independent domestic body, which may be a regulatory body as referred to in Article 115(2)(d) of this Agreement, to resolve disputes regarding terms and conditions for interconnection and/or access.</article>

3. The Parties shall ensure that the assignment of national numbering resources and the management of national numbering plans are entrusted to the regulatory authority. 


4. Where public or local authorities retain ownership or control of service suppliers operating public communications networks and/or services, effective structural separation needs to be ensured between the function responsible for granting the rights of way from activities associated with ownership or control.</article>
      <article number="ARTICLE 120" name="Universal Service" article_identifier="31987">1. Each Party has the right to define the kind of universal service obligations it wishes to maintain. 


2. Such obligations will not be regarded as anti-competitive per se, provided they are administered in a transparent, objective and non-discriminatory way. The administration of such obligations shall also be neutral with respect to competition and be not more burdensome than necessary for the kind of universal service defined by the Party. 


3. The Parties shall ensure that all service suppliers should be eligible to ensure universal service and no service supplier shall be a priori excluded. The designation shall be made through an efficient, transparent, objective and non- discriminatory mechanism. Where necessary, Parties shall assess whether the provision of universal service represents an unfair burden on organisations(s) designated to provide universal service. Where justified on the basis of such calculation, and taking into account the market benefit if any which accrues to an organisation that offers universal service, regulatory authorities shall determine whether a mechanism is required to compensate the service supplier(s) concerned or to share the net cost of universal service obligations. 


4. The Parties shall ensure that: 

(a) directories of all subscribers (1) are available to users, whether printed or electronic, or both, and are updated on a regular basis, and at least once a year;

The Parties shall ensure that in the event of a dispute arising between service suppliers of electronic communication networks or services in connection with rights and obligations referred to in this Chapter, the regulatory authority concerned shall, at the request of either Party, issue a binding decision to resolve the dispute in the shortest possible timeframe and in any case within four months.

This Chapter envisages mutual access to public procurement markets on the basis of the principle of national treatment at national, regional and local level for public contracts and concessions in the traditional sector as well as in the utilities sector. It provides for the progressive approximation of the public procurement legislation in Ukraine with the EU public procurement acquis, accompanied with an institutional reform and the creation of an efficient public procurement system based on the principles governing public procurement in the EU Party and the terms and definitions set out in Directive 2004/18/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 31 March 2004 on the coordination of procedures for the award of public works contracts, public supply contracts and public service contracts (hereinafter referred to as "Directive 2004/18/EC") and Directive 2004/17/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 31 March 2004 coordinating the procurement procedures of entities operating in the water, energy, transport and postal services sectors (hereinafter referred to as "Directive 2004/17/EC").</article>

It covers also bodies governed by public law and public undertakings in the field of utilities such as state-owned enterprises carrying out the relevant activities and private undertakings operating on the basis of special and exclusive rights in the field of utilities. 


3. This Chapter applies to contracts above value thresholds set out in Annex XXI-P: 
The calculation of the estimated value of a public contract shall be based on the total amount payable, net of Value Added Tax. When applying these thresholds, Ukraine will calculate and convert these values into its own national currency, using the exchange rate of its National Bank. 

These value thresholds shall be revised regularly every two years, beginning in the first even year following the entry into force of the Agreement, based on the average daily value of the Euro, expressed in Special Drawing Rights, over the 24 months terminating on the last day of August preceding the revision with effect from January 1. The value of the thresholds thus revised shall, where necessary, be rounded down to nearest thousand Euro. The revision of the thresholds shall be adopted by the Trade Committee according to the procedure defined in Title VII (Institutional General and Final Provisions) of this Agreement.</article>

2. In the framework of the institutional reform, Ukraine shall designate in particular: 

(a) 	a central executive body responsible for economic policy tasked with guaranteeing a coherent policy in all areas related to public procurement. Such a body shall facilitate and coordinate the implementation of this Chapter and guide the process of legislative approximation 


(b) an impartial and independent body tasked with the review of decisions taken by contracting authorities or entities during the award of contracts. In this context, "independent" means that that body shall be a public authority which is separate from all contracting entities and economic operators. There shall be a possibility to subject the decisions taken by this body to judicial review. 
3. The Parties shall ensure that decisions taken by the authorities responsible for the review of complaints shall be effectively enforced.</article>
      <article number="ARTICLE 151" name="Basic Standards Regulating The Award Of Contracts" article_identifier="32018">1.

These basic standards derive directly from the rules and principles of public procurement, as regulated in the EU public procurement acquis, including the principles of non-discrimination, equal treatment, transparency and proportionality. 



Publication 

2. The Parties shall ensure that all intended procurements are published in an appropriate media in a manner that is sufficient: 


(a) to enable the market to be opened up to competition; and 


(b) to 	allow any interested economic operator to have appropriate access to information regarding the intended procurement prior to the award of the contract and to express its interest in obtaining the contract. 

3. The publication shall be appropriate to the economic interest of the contract to economic operators. 


4. The publication shall contain at least the essential details of the contract to be awarded, the criteria for qualitative selection, the award method, the contract award criteria and any other additional information that the economic operators reasonably need to make a decision on whether to express their interest in obtaining the contract. 
Award of contracts 


5. All contracts shall be awarded through transparent and impartial award procedures that prevent corruptive practices. This impartiality shall be ensured especially through the non-discriminatory description of the subject-matter of the contract, equal access for all economic operators, appropriate time-limits and a transparent and objective approach. 


6. When describing the characteristics of the required work, supply or service, the contracting entities shall use general descriptions of performance and functions and international, European or national standards. 


7. The description of the characteristics required of a work, supply or service should not refer to a specific make or source, or a particular process, or to trade-marks, patents, types or a specific origin or production unless such a reference is justified by the subject-matter of the contract and accompanied by the words 'or equivalent'. Preference shall be given to the use of general descriptions of performance or functions. 


8. Contracting entities shall not impose conditions resulting in direct or indirect discrimination against the economic operators of the other Party, such as the requirement that economic operators interested in the contract must be established in the same country, region or territory as the contracting entity. 

Notwithstanding the above, in cases where it is justified by the specific circumstances of the contract, the successful applicant may be required to establish certain business infrastructure at the place of performance. 

9. The time-limits for expression of interest and for submission of offers shall be sufficiently long to allow economic operators from the other Party to make a meaningful assessment of the tender and prepare their offer. 


10. All participants must be able to know the applicable rules, selection criteria and award criteria in advance. These rules must apply equally to all participants. 


11. Contracting entities may invite a limited number of applicants to submit an offer, provided that: 

(a) this is done in a transparent and non-discriminatory manner; and 


(b) the selection is based only on objective factors such as the experience of the applicants in the sector concerned, the size and infrastructure of their businesses or their technical and professional abilities. 
In inviting a limited number of applicants to submit an offer, account should be taken of the need to ensure adequate competition. 


12. Contracting entities may use negotiated procedures only in exceptional defined cases when the use of such a procedure effectively does not distort competition. 


13. Contracting entities may use qualification systems only on condition that the list of qualified operators is compiled by means of a sufficiently advertised, transparent and open procedure. Contracts falling within the scope of such systems shall be awarded also on a non-discriminatory basis. 


14. The Parties shall ensure that contracts are awarded in a transparent manner to the applicant who has submitted the economically most advantageous offer or the offer with the lowest price, based on the tender criteria and the procedural rules established and communicated in advance. The final decisions are to be communicated to all applicants without undue delay. Upon request of an unsuccessful applicant, reasons must be provided in sufficient detail to allow a review of the decision. 
Judicial protection 

15. The Parties shall ensure that any person having or having had an interest in obtaining a particular contract and who has been, or risks, being harmed by an alleged infringement is entitled to effective, impartial judicial protection against any decision of the contracting entity related to the award of that contract. The decisions taken in the course and at the end of such review procedure shall be made public in a manner that is sufficient to inform all interested economic operators.</article>

2. A design applied to or incorporated in a product which constitutes a component part of a complex product shall only be considered to be new and to have individual character: 

(a) if the component part, once it has been incorporated into the complex product, remains visible during normal use of the latter; and 


(b) to the extent that those visible features of the component part fulfil in themselves the requirements as to novelty and individual character. 
3. A design shall be considered to be new if no identical design has been made available to the public: 


(a) in the case of an unregistered design, before the date on which the design for which protection is claimed has first been made available to the public; 


(b) in the case of a registered design, before the date of filing of the application for registration of the design for which protection is claimed, or, if priority is claimed, the date of priority. 
Designs shall be deemed to be identical if their features differ only in immaterial details.

(a) in the case of an unregistered design, before the date on which the design for which protection is claimed has first been made available to the public; 


(b) in the case of a registered design, before the date of filing of the application for registration of the design for which protection is claimed, or, if priority is claimed, the date of priority. 
In assessing individual character, the degree of freedom of the designer in developing the design shall be taken into consideration. 


5. This protection shall be provided by registration, and shall confer exclusive rights upon their holders in accordance with the provisions of this Article. Unregistered designs made available to the public shall confer the same exclusive rights, but only if the contested use results from copying the protected design. 


6. A design shall be deemed to have been made available to the public if it has been published following registration or otherwise, or exhibited, used in trade or otherwise disclosed, except where these events could not reasonably have become known in the normal course of business to the circles specialised in the sector concerned, operating within the territory in which protection is claimed, before the date of filing of the application for registration or, if priority is claimed, the date of priority. In the case of unregistered design protection, a design shall be deemed to have been made available to the public if it has been published, exhibited, used in trade or otherwise disclosed in such way that, in the normal course of business, these events could reasonably have become known to the circles specialised in the sector concerned, operating within the territory in which protection is claimed. 

A design shall not, however, be deemed to have been made available to the public for the sole reason that it has been disclosed to a third person under explicit or implicit conditions of confidentiality. 

7. Disclosure shall not be taken into consideration for the purpose of applying paragraphs 3 and 4 of this Article if a design for which protection is claimed under a registered design right has been made available to the public: 

(a) by the designer, his/her successor in title, or a third person as a result of information provided or action taken by the designer, or his/her successor in title; and

The Parties recognise that medicinal and plant protection products protected by a patent in their respective territory may be subject to an administrative authorisation procedure before being put on their market. They recognise that the period that elapses between the filing of the application for a patent and the first authorisation to place the product on their respective market, as defined for that purpose by the relevant legislation, may shorten the period of effective protection under the patent. 


2. The Parties shall provide for a further period of protection for a medicinal or plant protection product which is protected by a patent and which has been subject to an administrative authorisation procedure, that period being equal to the period referred to in paragraph 1, reduced by a period of five years. 


3. In the case of medicinal products for which paediatric studies have been carried out, and the results of those studies are reflected in the product information, the Parties shall provide for a further six-month extension of the period of protection referred to in paragraph 2 of this Article.</article>
      <article number="ARTICLE 221" name="Protection Of Biotechnological Inventions" article_identifier="32088">1. Parties shall protect biotechnological inventions under national patent law. They shall, if necessary, adjust their patent law to take account of the provisions of this Agreement. This Article shall be without prejudice to the obligations of the Parties pursuant to international agreements, and in particular the TRIPS Agreement and the Convention on Biological Diversity of 1992 (hereinafter referred to as the "CBD"). 


2. For the purposes of this Sub-section: 

(a)	 "biological material" means any material containing genetic information and capable of reproducing itself or being reproduced in a biological system; 


(b)	 "microbiological process" means any process involving or performed upon or resulting in microbiological material. 
3. For the purposes of this Agreement: inventions which are new, which involve an inventive step and which are susceptible of industrial application shall be patentable even if they concern a product consisting of or containing biological material or a process by means of which biological material is produced, processed or used. 

Biological material which is isolated from its natural environment or produced by means of a technical process may be the subject of an invention even if it previously occurred in nature. 

An element isolated from the human body or otherwise produced by means of a technical process, including the sequence or partial sequence of a gene, may constitute a patentable invention, even if the structure of that element is identical to that of a natural element. The industrial application of a sequence or a partial sequence of a gene must be disclosed in the patent application. 

4. The following shall not be patentable: 


(a) plant and animal varieties; 


(b) essentially biological processes for the production of plants or animals; 


(c) the human body, at the various stages of its formation and development, and the simple discovery of one of its elements, including the sequence or partial sequence of a gene. 
Inventions which concern plants or animals shall be patentable if the technical feasibility of the invention is not confined to a particular plant or animal variety. Subparagraph (b) of this paragraph shall be without prejudice to the patentability of inventions which concern a microbiological or other technical process or a product obtained by means of such a process. 

5. Inventions shall be considered unpatentable where their commercial exploitation would be contrary to public policy or public morality; however, exploitation shall not be thus deemed contrary merely because it is prohibited by law or regulation. The following, in particular, shall be considered unpatentable: 


(a) processes for cloning human beings; 


(b) processes for modifying the germ line genetic identity of human beings; 


(c) uses of human embryos for industrial or commercial purposes; 


(d) processes for modifying the genetic identity of animals which 	are likely to cause them suffering without any substantial medical benefit to man or animal, and also animals resulting from such processes. 

6. The protection conferred by a patent on a biological material possessing specific characteristics as a result of an invention shall extend to any biological material derived from that biological material through propagation or multiplication in an identical or divergent form and possessing those same characteristics. 


7. The protection conferred by a patent on a process that enables a biological material possessing specific characteristics to be produced as a result of an invention shall extend to biological material directly obtained through that process and to any other biological material derived from the directly obtained biological material through propagation or multiplication in an identical or divergent form and possessing those same characteristics. 


8. The protection conferred by a patent on a product containing or consisting of genetic information shall extend to all material, save as provided in paragraph 4(c) of this Article, in which the product is incorporated and in which the genetic information is contained and performs its function. 


9. The protection referred to in paragraphs 7 and 8 of this Article shall not extend to biological material obtained from the propagation or multiplication of biological material placed on the market in the territory of the Parties by the holder of the patent or with his/her consent, where the multiplication or propagation necessarily results from the application for which the biological material was marketed, provided that the material obtained is not subsequently used for other propagation or multiplication. 


10. By way of derogation from paragraphs 7 and 8 of this Article, the sale or any other form of commercialisation of plant propagating material to a farmer by the holder of the patent or with his/her consent for agricultural use implies authorisation for the farmer to use the product of his/her harvest for propagation or multiplication by him/her on his/her own farm. The extent and conditions of this derogation shall correspond to the conditions provided for in the Parties' national laws, regulations and practices concerning plant variety rights. 

By way of derogation from paragraphs 7 and 8 of this Article, the sale or any other form of commercialisation of breeding stock or other animal reproductive material to a farmer by the holder of the patent or with his/her consent implies authorisation for the farmer to use the protected livestock for an agricultural purpose. This includes making the animal or other animal reproductive material available for the purposes of pursuing agricultural activity but not sale within the framework or for the purpose of a commercial reproduction activity. The extent and the conditions of the derogation provided for above shall be determined by national laws, regulations and practices. 

11. The Parties shall provide for compulsory cross-licensing in the following cases: 

(a) where a breeder cannot acquire or exploit a plant variety right without infringing a prior patent, he/she may apply for a compulsory licence for non-exclusive use of the invention protected by the patent inasmuch as the licence is necessary for the exploitation of the plant variety to be protected, subject to payment of an appropriate royalty. The Parties shall provide that, where such a licence is granted, the holder of the patent will be entitled to a cross-licence on reasonable terms to use the protected variety; 


(b) where the holder of a patent concerning a biotechnological invention cannot exploit it without infringing a prior plant variety right, he/she may apply for a compulsory licence for non-exclusive use of the plant variety protected by that right, subject to payment of an appropriate royalty. The Parties shall provide that, where such a licence is granted, the holder of the variety right will be entitled to a cross-licence on reasonable terms to use the protected invention. 
12. Applicants for the licences referred to in paragraph 11 of this Article must demonstrate that: 


(a) they have applied unsuccessfully to the holder of the patent or of the plant variety right to obtain a contractual licence; 


(b) the plant variety 	or the invention constitutes significant technical progress of considerable economic interest compared with the invention claimed in the patent or the protected plant variety.</article>
      <article number="ARTICLE 222" name="Protection Of Data Submitted To Obtain An Authorisation To Put A Medicinal Product On The Market" article_identifier="32089">1. The Parties shall implement a comprehensive system to guarantee the confidentiality, non-disclosure and non-reliance of data submitted for the purpose of obtaining an authorisation to put a medicinal product on the market. 


2. For that purpose, when a Party requires the submission of test data or studies concerning the safety and efficacy of a medicinal product prior to granting approval for the marketing of such product, the Party shall not, for a period of at least five years from the date of the first approval in that Party, permit other applicants to market the same or a similar product, on the basis of the marketing approval granted to the applicant which had provided the test data or studies, unless the applicant which had provided the test data or studies has given consent. During such period, the test data or studies submitted for the first approval will not be used for the benefit of any subsequent applicant aiming to obtain a marketing approval for a medicinal product, except when the consent of the first applicant is given. 


3. Ukraine shall undertake to align its legislation concerning data protection for medicinal products with that of the EU at a date to be decided by the Trade Committee.</article>
      <article number="ARTICLE 223" name="Data Protection On Plant Protection Products" article_identifier="32090">1. The Parties shall determine safety and efficacy requirements before authorising the placing on the market of plant protection products. 


2. The Parties shall recognise a temporary right to the owner of a test or study report submitted for the first time to achieve a marketing authorisation for a plant protection product. During such period, the test or study report will not be used for the benefit of any other person aiming to obtain a marketing authorisation for a plant protection product, except when the explicit consent of the first owner is given. This right will be hereinafter referred to as "data protection". 


3. The Parties shall determine the conditions to be fulfilled by the test or study report. 


4. The period of data protection should be at least 10 years starting from the date of the first authorisation in the Party concerned. The Parties may decide to provide an extension of the period of protection for low-risk plant protection products. In such a situation, the period can be extended to 13 years. 


5. The Parties may decide that those periods shall be extended for each extension of authorisation for minor uses (1). In such a situation, the total period of data protection may in no case exceed 13 years or, for low-risk plant protection products, 15 years. 


6. A test or study shall also be protected if it was necessary for the renewal or review of an authorisation. In those cases, the period for data protection shall be 30 months. 


7. Rules to avoid duplicative testing on vertebrate animals will be laid down by the Parties. Any applicant intending to perform tests and studies involving vertebrate animals shall take the necessary measures to verify that those tests and studies have not already been performed or initiated. 


8. A new applicant and the holder or holders of the relevant authorisations shall make every effort to ensure that they share tests and studies involving vertebrate animals. The costs of sharing the test and study reports shall be determined in a fair, transparent and non-discriminatory way. A new applicant is only required to share in the costs of information he/she is required to submit to meet the authorisation requirements. 


9. Where the new applicant and the holder or holders of the relevant authorisations of plant protection products cannot reach agreement on the sharing of test and study reports involving vertebrate animals, the new applicant shall inform the Party. 
(1) Minor use: use of a plant protection product in a particular Party on plants or plant products which are not widely grown in that particular Party or widely grown to meet an exceptional plant protection need. 


10. Failure to reach agreement shall not prevent the Party concerned from using the test and study reports involving vertebrate animals for the purpose of the application of the new applicant. 


11. The holder or holders of the relevant authorisation shall have a claim on the new applicant for a fair share of the costs incurred by him/her. The Party concerned may direct the parties involved to resolve the matter by formal and binding arbitration administered under national law.
