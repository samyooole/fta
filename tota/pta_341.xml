19. When the period established in paragraph 18 concludes and the competent authority of the importing Party does not issue a determination of origin, the good subject to the verification of origin shall receive the same preferential tariff treatment as if it were an originating good. 


20. Where through a verification the importing Party determines that an importer, exporter or a producer has provided more than once, a false or unfounded certificate of origin or stating that a good qualifies as originating, the importing Party may suspend preferential tariff treatment to the identical goods imported, exported or produced by that person, until it is proved that such person is in compliance with all the requirements under Chapter 4 (Rules of Origin) and this Chapter. 


21. When the competent authority of the importing Party determines that a good imported into its territory does not qualify as originating, the importer must pay any custom duties owed and other applicable charges according to the legislation of each Party. 


22.
