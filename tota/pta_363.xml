5 	A Party proposing to take or extend emergency action shall provide adequate opportunity for prior consultations with other Parties, with a view to reviewing the information provided Wlder Paragraph 4, exchanging views on the emergency action, and reaching a mutually satisfactory resolution of the situation. Where prior consultations cannot be held in cases of provisional emergency action, the Party shall enter into consultations immediately after taking provisional emergency action. 

6 	A Party wishing to take emergency action pursuant to Articles 11, 12 or 13 shall first conduct a public investigation to determine whether such action is justified Wlder this Agreement. The investigation shall include reasonable public notice to all interested persons, and an inquiry where importers, exporters and other interested persons can present evidence and make submissions, respond to the presentations of other persons, and submit their views as to whether the proposed emergency action would be in the public interest.

8 	The Party shall promptly publish a detailed report setring out its findings, the evidence on which its findings are based, and reasoned conclusions reached on all pertinent issues of fact and law. 

9 	In critical circumstances where delay would cause the adverse effects that justify emergency action under Article 11, 12 or 13, a Party may take provisional emergency action pursuant to a preliminary determination that there is clear evidence that emergency action is justified.

      <article number="ARTICLE 11" name="Safeguard Measures" article_identifier="27392">1 	Where a Party has conducted an investigation under Article 10 and has determined that a product is being imported into its territory from another Party in such quantities, absolute or relative to domestic production, and under such conditions as to cause or threaten to cause serious injury to the domestic industry which produces like or directly competitive products, the first Party may apply a safeguard measure to that product. 

2 	No Party shall apply a safeguard measure unless its investigation under Article 10 demonstrates, on the basis of objective evidence, the existence of the causal link between imports of the product concerned and serious injury or threat of serious injury. When factors other than imports are causing injury to the domestic industry at the same time, the safeguard measure may only be taken proportionate to the injury caused by the imports. 

3 	Any provisional safeguard measures shall take the form of tariff increases. If the investigation required by Article 10 does not determine that increased imports have caused or threaten to cause serious injury to a domestic industry provisional safeguard measures shall be promptly rescinded and any increased tariffs paid shall be promptly refunded or, where agreed to by the importer, credited. 

4 	A Party may apply a safeguard measure to a product by imposing or increasing tariffs for the minimum period and to the minimum extent necessary to prevent the serious injury caused by imports, provided that where the Party has goods listed as excepted imports in Annex III the Party at the same time removes sufficient goods from its list of excepted imports to compensate for the increased restriction on trade provided by the safeguard measure. 

5 	The initial period of application of a safeguard measure shall not exceed four years.

(a) 	two years; or 


(b) 	the total period of time, including any extension, during which the safeguard measure was applied

(a) 	at least one year has elapsed since the date of introduction of a safeguard measure on the import of that product; and 


(b) 	a safeguard measure has not been applied on the same product more than twice in the five year period immediately preceding the introduction of the

2 	Where a Party has conducted an investigation under Article 10 and has determined that goods being imported into it from another Party, or other Parties, are subsidised by the Party or Parties so as to cause or threaten to cause serious injury to a domestic industry producing like or directly competitive goods or to materially retard the establishment of a domestic industry to produce like or directly competitive goods, it shall enter into consultations with the other Party or Parties, in accordance with Article 21, with a view to agreeing on measures to reduce or prevent injury or retardation which are consistent with the objectives of this 

Agreement. 

3 	Where a mutually acceptable solution to the problem is not achieved within 60 days of the commencement of consultations under Paragraph 1 or 2, the first Party shall give notice to the other Party, or Parties, of its intention to levy anti-dumping or countervailing duties on the goods. 

4 	No agreed solution shall be inconsistent with the provisions of Paragraph 2 of Article 9. 

5 	If further consultations between the Parties fail to resolve the issue, the first Party may, pursuant to Paragraph 10 of Article 10, no earlier than 60 days after notice was given to the other Party or Parties, levy anti-dumping or countervailing duties on the dumped or subsidised products. Such duties shall not exceed the rate of dumping or subsidisation. 

6 	Duties levied pursuant to Paragraph 5 shall be reviewed by the Party imposing the duties, after one year, and annually thereafter, to determine whether the conditions necessary for the imposition of anti-dumping or countervailing duties under this Article, still apply. Ifthe review determines that dumping or subsidisation has ceased, the duties shall be immediately eliminated. If the review determines otherwise the duties may continue to be applied, but shall not exceed the rate of dumping or subsidisation found to exist at the time of the review. 

7 	The Parties agree to eliminate any subsidies that cause or threaten to cause serious injury to a domestic industry producing like or directly competitive goods, or to materially retard the establishment of a domestic industry to produce like or directly competitive goods, in another Party.

3 	Subject to Paragraph 4, the initial period of action taken under this Article shall not exceed five years, or ten years in the case of measures taken by Small Island States or Least Developed Countries.
