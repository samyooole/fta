Not later than three years after the entry into force of this Agreement, the Parties will review the provisions in force governing rules of origin with the objective to simplify the concepts and methods used to determine the origin taking into account the development objectives of Ghana. Within this revision process, the Parties will take into account technological development, production processes and any other factor including the ongoing reforms with regard to rules of origin which might require amendment of the reciprocal negotiated regime.

(1) For this calculation official data by the WTO on leading exporters in world merchandise trade (excluding intra-EU trade) shall be used. 


2. Imported products originating in the other Party shall be accorded treatment no less favourable than that accorded to like national products in respect of all laws, regulations and requirements affecting their internal sale, offering for sale, purchase, transportation, distribution or use. The provisions of this paragraph shall not prevent the application of differential internal transportation charges which are based exclusively on the economic operation of the means of transport and not on the nationality of the product. 


3. No Party shall establish or maintain any internal quantitative regulation relating to the mixture, processing or use of products in specified amounts or proportions which requires, directly or indirectly, that any specified amount or proportion of any product which is the subject of the regulation must be supplied from domestic sources. Moreover, no Party shall otherwise apply internal quantitative regulations so as to afford protection to national production. 


4. The provisions of this Article shall not prevent the payment of subsidies exclusively to national producers, including payments to national producers derived from the proceeds of internal taxes or charges applied consistently with the provisions of this Article and subsidies effected through governmental purchases of national products or for their benefit.

      <article number="ARTICLE 21" name="Special Provisions On Administrative Cooperation" article_identifier="39916">1. The Parties agree that administrative cooperation is essential for the implementation and the control of the preferential treatment granted under this Title and underline their commitment to combat irregularities and fraud in customs and related matters. 


2. Where a Party has made a finding, on the basis of objective information, of a failure to provide administrative cooperation and/or of irregularities or fraud, the Party concerned may temporarily suspend the relevant preferential treatment of the product(s) concerned in accordance with this Article. 


3. For the purpose of this Article a failure to provide administrative cooperation shall mean, inter alia: 

(a) 	a repeated failure to respect the obligations to verify the originating status of the product(s) concerned; 


(b) 	a repeated refusal or undue delay in carrying out and/or communicating the results of subsequent verification of the proof of origin; 


(c) 	a repeated refusal or undue delay in obtaining authorisation to conduct administrative cooperation missions to verify the authenticity of documents or accuracy of information relevant to the granting of the preferential treatment in question. 
For the purpose of this Article a finding of irregularities or fraud may be made, inter alia, where there is a rapid increase, without satisfactory explanation, in imports of goods exceeding the usual level of production and export capacity of the other Party, which is linked to objective information concerning irregularities or fraud. 

4. The application of a temporary suspension shall be subject to the following conditions: 


(a) 	The Party which has made a finding, on the basis of objective information, of a failure to provide administrative cooperation and/or of irregularities or fraud shall without undue delay notify the EPA Committee of its finding together with the objective information and enter into consultations within the EPA Committee, on the basis of all relevant information and objective findings, with a view to reaching a solution acceptable to both Parties; 


(b) 	Where the Parties have entered into consultations within the EPA Committee as above and have failed to agree on an acceptable solution within three months following the notification, the Party concerned may temporarily suspend the relevant preferential treatment of the product(s) concerned. A temporary suspension shall be notified to the EPA Committee without undue delay; 


(c) 	Temporary suspensions under this Article shall be limited to that necessary to protect the financial interests of the Party concerned. They shall not exceed a period of six months, which may be renewed. Temporary suspensions shall be notified immediately after their adoption to the EPA Committee. They shall be subject to periodic consultations within the EPA Committee in particular with a view to their termination as soon as the conditions for their application are no longer met. 
5. At the same time as the notification to the EPA Committee under paragraph 4(a), the Party concerned should publish a notice to importers in its Official Journal. The notice to importers should indicate for the product concerned that there is a finding, on the basis of objective information, of a failure to provide administrative cooperation and/or of irregularities or fraud.</article>
      <article number="ARTICLE 22" name="Management Of Administrative Errors" article_identifier="39917">In case of error by the competent authorities in the proper management of the preferential system of export, and in particular in the application of the provisions concerning the definition of the concept of ‘originating products’ and methods of administrative cooperation, where this error leads to consequences in terms of import duties, the Party facing such consequences may request the EPA Committee to examine the possibilities of adopting all appropriate measures with a view to resolving the situation.</article>

For the purpose of this Article, origin shall be determined in accordance with the non-preferential rules of origin of the Parties. 


2. Before imposing definitive anti-dumping or countervailing duties the Parties shall consider the possibility of constructive remedies as provided for in the relevant WTO agreements. To this end, the Parties may hold appropriate consultations.

3. The provisions of paragraph 2 shall apply for a period of five years, beginning on the date of entry into force of the Agreement. Not later than 120 days before the end of this period, the EPA Committee shall review the operation of those provisions in the light of the development needs of the Ghanaian Party, with a view to determining whether to extend their application for a further period.

(b) 	The Ghanaian Party may take safeguard measures where a product originating in the EC Party as a result of the reduction of duties is being imported into its territory in such increased quantities and under such conditions as to cause or threaten to cause disturbances to an infant industry producing like or directly competitive products. Such provision is only applicable for a period of ten years from the date of entry into force of this Agreement. Measures must be taken in accordance with the provisions of paragraphs 6 to 9. 

However, if agreed by both Parties, this period may be extended if, despite the industrial development potential and the efforts actually undertaken, this objective has not been achieved due to the world economic situation or serious troubles affecting Ghana.

(b) 	The EPA Committee may make any recommendation needed to remedy the circumstances which have arisen. If no recommendation has been made by the EPA Committee aimed at remedying the circumstances, or no other satisfactory solution has been reached within 30 days of the matter being referred to the EPA Committee, the importing Party may adopt the appropriate measures to remedy the circumstances in accordance with this Article; 


(c) 	Before taking any measure provided for in this Article or, in the cases to which paragraph 8 applies, as soon as possible, Ghana shall supply the EPA Committee with all relevant information required for a thorough examination of the situation, with a view to seeking a solution acceptable to the Parties concerned; 


(d) 	In the selection of safeguard measures pursuant to this Article, priority must be given to those which permit to correct efficiently and quickly the problem in question while disturbing to the least extent possible the good operation of this Agreement;

8. Where exceptional circumstances require immediate action, the importing Party concerned, whether the EC Party or the Ghanaian Party as the case may be, may take the measures provided for in paragraphs 3, 4 and/or 5 on a provisional basis without complying with the requirements of paragraph 7. Such action may be taken for a maximum period of 180 days where measures are taken by the EC Party and 200 days where measures are taken by the Ghanaian Party, or where measures taken by the EC Party are limited to the territory of one or more of its outermost regions. The duration of any such provisional measure shall be counted as a part of the initial period and any extension referred to in 

paragraph 6. In the taking of such provisional measures, the interest of all Parties involved shall be taken into account. The importing Party concerned shall inform the other Party concerned and it shall immediately refer the matter to the EPA Committee for examination. 

9. If an importing Party subjects imports of a product to an administrative procedure having as its purpose the rapid provision of information on the trend of trade flows liable to give rise to the problems referred to in this Article, it shall inform the EPA Committee without delay.
