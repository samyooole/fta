    <chapter number="CHAPTER THREE" name="Textiles And Apparel" chapter_identifier="218">
      <article number="ARTICLE 3.1" name="Bilateral Emergency Action" article_identifier="1633">1. If, as a result of the reduction or elimination of a duty under this Agreement, a textile or apparel good benefiting from preferential tariff treatment is being imported into the territory of a Party in such increased quantities, in absolute terms or relative to the domestic market for that good, and under such conditions as to cause serious damage, or actual threat thereof, to a domestic industry producing a like or directly competitive good, the Party may, to the extent and for such time as may be necessary to prevent or remedy such damage and to facilitate adjustment, take emergency action, consisting of an increase in the rate of duty on the good to a level not to exceed the lesser of: 


(a) 	the most-favored-nation (“MFN”) applied rate of duty in effect at the time the action is taken; and  


(b) 	the MFN applied rate of duty in effect on the date of entry into force of this Agreement.  
2. 	In determining serious damage, or actual threat thereof, the importing Party:  


(a) 	shall examine the effect of increased imports of the good from the exporting Party on the particular industry, as reflected in changes in such relevant economic variables as output, productivity, utilization of capacity, inventories, market share, exports, wages, employment, domestic prices, profits, and investment, none of which shall necessarily be decisive; and 


(b) 	shall not consider changes in technology or consumer preference as factors supporting a determination of serious damage or actual threat thereof. 

3. The importing Party may take an emergency action under this Article only following an investigation by its competent authorities. 


4. The importing Party shall deliver to the exporting Party, without delay, written notice of its intent to take emergency action and, on the request of the exporting Party, shall enter into consultations with that Party regarding the matter.  


5. 	An importing Party:  


(a) 	shall not maintain an emergency action for a period exceeding three  years; 


(b) 	shall not take or maintain an emergency action against a good beyond ten years after the Party must eliminate customs duties on that good pursuant to this Agreement;  


(c) 	shall not take an emergency action more than once against the same good of the other Party; and 


(d) 	shall, on termination of the emergency action, apply to the good that was subject to the emergency action the rate of duty that would have been in effect but for the action. 

6. 	The importing Party shall provide to the exporting Party mutually agreed 

trade liberalizing compensation in the form of concessions having substantially equivalent trade effects or equivalent to the value of the additional duties expected to result from the emergency action.  Such concessions shall be limited to textile and apparel goods, unless the Parties agree otherwise. If the Parties are unable to agree on compensation, the exporting Party may suspend tariff concessions under this Agreement having trade effects substantially equivalent to the trade effects of the emergency action.  Such tariff action may be taken against any goods of the importing Party.  The exporting Party shall apply the tariff action only for the minimum period necessary to achieve the substantially equivalent trade effects.  The importing Party’s obligation to provide trade compensation and the exporting Party’s right to take tariff action shall terminate when the emergency action terminates.   

7. Nothing in this Agreement shall be construed to limit a Party’s right to restrain imports of textile and apparel goods in a manner consistent with the Agreement on Textiles and Clothing or the Safeguards Agreement.  However, a Party may not take or maintain an emergency action under this Article against a textile or apparel good that is subject, or becomes subject, to a safeguard measure that a Party takes pursuant to either such agreement.</article>
      <article number="ARTICLE 3.2" name="Rules Of Origin And Related Matters" article_identifier="1634">Application of Chapter Four 


1. Except as provided in this Chapter, including its Annexes, Chapter Four (Rules of Origin) applies to textile and apparel goods. 


2. For greater certainty, the rules of origin set forth in this Agreement shall not apply in determining the country of origin of a textile or apparel good for non-preferential purposes. 
Consultations 


3. On the request of either Party, the Parties shall consult to consider whether the rules of origin applicable to a particular textile or apparel good should be revised to address issues of availability of supply of fibers, yarns, or fabrics in the territories of the Parties. 


4. In the consultations referred to in paragraph 3, each Party shall consider all data presented by the other Party that demonstrate substantial production in its territory of a particular fiber, yarn, or fabric. The Parties shall consider that there is substantial production if a Party demonstrates that its domestic producers are capable of supplying commercial quantities of the fiber, yarn, or fabric in a timely manner. 


5. The Parties shall endeavor to conclude consultations within 60 days after delivery of a request. If the Parties agree in the consultations to revise a rule of origin, the agreement shall supersede that rule of origin when approved by the Parties in accordance with Article 21.2 (Amendments). 
De Minimis 

6. A textile or apparel good that is not an originating good because certain fibers or yarns used in the production of the component of the good that determines the tariff classification of the good do not undergo an applicable change in tariff classification set out in Annex 3-A, shall nonetheless be considered to be an originating good if the total weight of all such fibers or yarns in that component is not more than seven percent of the total weight of that component.  Notwithstanding the preceding sentence, a good containing elastomeric yarns in the component of the good that determines the tariff classification of the good shall be considered to be an originating good only if such yarns are wholly formed in the territory of a Party. 

Treatment of Sets 

7. Notwithstanding the specific rules of origin set out in Annex 3-A, textile or apparel goods classified under General Rule of Interpretation 3 of the Harmonized System as goods put up in sets for retail sale shall not be regarded as originating goods unless each of the goods in the set is an originating good or the total value of the non-originating goods in the set does not exceed 10 percent of the value of the set determined for purposes of assessing customs duties. 

Preferential Tariff Treatment for Certain Non-Originating Textile and Apparel Goods 

8. Subject to paragraph 9, each Party shall accord preferential tariff treatment to the following goods, if they meet the applicable conditions for preferential tariff treatment under this Agreement other than the condition that they be originating goods: 


(a) 	cotton or man-made fiber fabric goods provided for in Chapters 52, 54, 55, 58, and 60 of the Harmonized System that are wholly formed in the territory of a Party from yarn produced or obtained outside the territory of a Party;

6. Each Party shall make its advance rulings publicly available, subject to confidentiality requirements in its law.   


7. If a requester provides false information or omits relevant circumstances or facts in its request for an advance ruling, or does not act in accordance with the

1. 	This Chapter applies to any measure regarding covered procurement. 


2. For purposes of this Chapter, covered procurement means a procurement of goods, services, or both: 


(a) 	by any contractual means, including purchase, rental, or lease, with or without an option to buy; build-operate-transfer contracts; and public works concession contracts;

Compliance 

4. Each Party shall ensure that its procuring entities comply with this Chapter in conducting covered procurement.  

Valuation 

5. In estimating the value of a procurement for the purpose of ascertaining whether it is a covered procurement, a procuring entity shall:  


(a) 	neither divide a procurement into separate procurements nor use a particular method for estimating the value of the procurement for the purpose of avoiding the application of this Chapter; 


(b) 	take into account all forms of remuneration, including any premiums, fees, commissions, interest, other revenue streams that may be provided for under the contract, and, where the procurement provides for the possibility of option clauses, the total maximum value of the procurement, inclusive of optional purchases; and  


(c) 	without prejudice to paragraph 6, where the procurement is to be conducted in multiple parts, with contracts to be awarded at the same time or over a given period to one or more suppliers, base its calculation of the total maximum value of the procurement over its entire duration. 
6. In the case of procurement by lease or rental or procurement that does not specify a total price, the basis for estimating the value of the procurement shall be, with respect to:  


(a) 	a fixed-term contract, 


(i) 	where the term is 12 months or less, the total estimated contract value for the contract’s duration, or 


(ii) 	where the term exceeds 12 months, the total estimated contract value, including the estimated residual value; or 

(b) 	a contract for an indefinite period, the estimated monthly installment multiplied by 48.  Where there is doubt as to whether the contract is to be a fixed-term contract, a procuring entity shall use the basis for estimating the value of the procurement described in this subparagraph.</article>

1. With respect to any measure covered by this Chapter, each Party, including its procuring entities, shall accord unconditionally to the goods and services of the other Party and to the suppliers of the other Party offering the goods or services of a Party, treatment no less favorable than the most favorable treatment the Party or the procuring entity accords to its own goods, services, and suppliers.  


2. 	A procuring entity of a Party may not:  


(a) 	treat a locally established supplier less favorably than another locally established supplier on the basis of degree of foreign affiliation or ownership; nor 


(b) 	discriminate against a locally established supplier on the basis that the goods or services offered by that supplier for a particular procurement are goods or services of the other Party. 
Rules of Origin 

3. For purposes of procurement covered by this Chapter, neither Party may apply rules of origin to goods imported from the other Party that are different from the rules of origin the Party applies in the normal course of trade to imports of the same goods from the other Party. 

Offsets 

4. A procuring entity may not seek, take account of, impose, or enforce offsets in the qualification and selection of suppliers, goods, or services, in the evaluation of tenders, or in the award of contracts, before or in the course of a covered procurement. 

Measures Not Specific to Procurement

      <article number="ARTICLE 9.4" name="Publication Of Notice Of Intended Procurement And Notice Of Planned Procurement" article_identifier="1683">Notice of Intended Procurement 


1. For each covered procurement, a procuring entity shall publish a notice inviting interested suppliers to submit tenders (“notice of intended procurement”) or, where appropriate, applications for participation in the procurement.  The notice shall be published in an electronic or paper medium that is widely disseminated and readily accessible to the public for the entire period established for tendering. 


2. A procuring entity shall include the following information in each notice of intended procurement:  


(a) 	the name and address of the procuring entity and other information necessary to contact the procuring entity and obtain all relevant documents relating to the procurement;

Notice of Planned Procurement 

3. Each Party shall encourage its procuring entities to publish as early as possible in each fiscal year a notice regarding the procuring entity’s procurement plans. The notice should include the subject matter of any planned procurement and the estimated date of the publication of the notice of intended procurement.  Where the notice is published in accordance with Article 9.5.2(a), a procuring entity may apply Article 9.5.2 for the purpose of establishing shorter time limits for tendering for covered procurements.</article>
      <article number="ARTICLE 9.5" name="Time Limits For Tendering Process" article_identifier="1684">1. A procuring entity shall prescribe time limits for tendering that allow suppliers sufficient time to prepare and submit responsive tenders, taking into account the nature and complexity of the procurement.  Except as provided for in paragraphs 2 and 3, a procuring entity shall provide no less than 40 days from the date of publication of a notice of intended procurement to the deadline for submission of tenders. 


2. Under the following circumstances, a procuring entity may establish a time limit for tendering that is less than 40 days, provided that such time limit is sufficiently long to enable suppliers to prepare and submit responsive tenders and is in no case less than ten days: 


(a) 	where the entity has published a separate notice, including a notice of planned procurement under Article 9.4.3, at least 40 days and not more than 12 months in advance, and such separate notice contains a description of the procurement; the time limits for the submission of tenders or, where appropriate, applications for participation in a procurement; and the address from which documents relating to the procurement may be obtained; 


(b) 	where the entity procures commercial goods or services, except that the procuring entity may not rely on this provision if it requires suppliers to satisfy conditions for participation; or 


(c) 	in duly substantiated cases of extreme urgency brought about by events unforeseeable by the procuring entity, such that a 40-day deadline would result in serious adverse consequences to the entity or the relevant Party. 

3. When a procuring entity publishes a notice of intended procurement in accordance with Article 9.4 in an electronic medium, the procuring entity may reduce the time limit for submission of a tender or an application for participation in a procurement by up to five days.  In no case shall the procuring entity reduce either time limit to less than ten days from the date on which the notice of intended procurement is published. 


4. A procuring entity shall require all participating suppliers to submit tenders by a common deadline.  For greater certainty, this requirement also applies where: 


(a) 	as a result of a need to amend information provided to suppliers during the procurement process, the procuring entity extends the time limit for qualification or tendering procedures; or  


(b) 	negotiations are terminated and suppliers are permitted to submit new tenders.</article>
      <article number="ARTICLE 9.6" name="Information On Intended Procurements" article_identifier="1685">Tender Documentation 

1. A procuring entity shall provide to any interested supplier tender documentation that includes all information necessary to permit suppliers to prepare and submit responsive tenders.  Unless already provided in the notice of intended procurement, such documentation shall include a complete description of: 


(a) 	the procurement, including the nature, scope, and, where quantifiable, the quantity of the goods or services to be procured and any requirements to be fulfilled, including any technical specifications, conformity certifications, plans, drawings, or instructional materials; 


(b) 	any conditions for participation, including any financial guarantees, information, and documents that suppliers are required to submit;  


(c) 	all criteria, including all cost factors, to be considered in awarding the contract, and the relative importance of such criteria; 


(d) 	the date, time, and place for the opening of tenders; and 


(e) 	any other terms or conditions, including terms of payment, relating to the procurement. 
2. 	A procuring entity shall promptly: 


(a) 	provide, on request, the tender documentation to any supplier participating in the procurement; and  


(b) 	reply to any reasonable request for relevant information by a supplier participating in the procurement, provided that such information does not give that supplier an advantage over its competitors in the procurement. 
Technical Specifications 


3. A procuring entity may not prepare, adopt, or apply any technical specification or prescribe any conformity assessment procedure with the purpose or the effect of creating unnecessary obstacles to trade between the Parties. 


4. In prescribing the technical specifications for the good or service being procured, a procuring entity shall: 


(a) 	specify the technical specification, wherever appropriate, in terms of performance and functional requirements, rather than design or descriptive characteristics; and  


(b) 	base the technical specification on international standards, where such exist and are applicable to the procuring entity, except where the use of an international standard would fail to meet the procuring entity’s program requirements or would impose more burdens than the use of a government-unique standard. 

5. A procuring entity may not prescribe technical specifications that require or refer to a particular trademark or trade name, patent, copyright, design or type, specific origin, producer, or supplier, unless there is no other sufficiently precise or intelligible way of describing the procurement requirements and provided that, in such cases, words such as “or equivalent” are included in the tender documentation. 


6. A procuring entity may not seek or accept, in a manner that would have the effect of precluding competition, advice that may be used in the preparation or adoption of any technical specification for a specific procurement from a person that may have a commercial interest in that procurement. 


7. For greater certainty, this Article is not intended to preclude a procuring entity from preparing, adopting, or applying technical specifications to promote the conservation of natural resources or to protect the environment. 
Modifications 

8. If, during the course of a procurement, a procuring entity modifies the criteria or technical requirements set out in a notice or tender documentation provided to participating suppliers, or amends or reissues a notice or tender documentation, it shall transmit all such modifications or amended or re-issued notice or tender documentation: 


(a) 	to all the suppliers that are participating at the time the information is amended, if known, and, in all other cases, in the same manner as the original information; and 


(b) 	in adequate time to allow such suppliers to modify and re-submit their tenders, as appropriate.</article>
      <article number="ARTICLE 9.7" name="Conditions For Participation" article_identifier="1686">General Requirements 

1. Where a procuring entity requires suppliers to satisfy conditions for participation, the entity shall, subject to the other provisions of this Chapter: 


(a) 	limit any conditions for participation to those that are essential to ensure that the supplier has the legal, commercial, technical, and financial abilities to fulfill the requirements and technical specifications of the procurement; 


(b) 	evaluate the financial, commercial, and technical abilities of a supplier on the basis of its global business activities, including both its activities in the territory of the Party of the supplier, as well as its activities, if any, in the territory of the Party of the procuring entity, and may not impose the condition that, in order for a supplier to participate in a procurement, the supplier has previously been awarded one or more contracts by a procuring entity of that Party or that the supplier has prior work experience in the territory of that Party; 


(c) 	base its determination of whether a supplier has satisfied the conditions for participation solely on the conditions that the procuring entity has specified in advance in notices or tender documentation; and 


(d) 	allow all suppliers that satisfy the conditions for participation to participate in the procurement. 

2. Nothing in this Article shall preclude a procuring entity from excluding a supplier from a procurement on grounds such as bankruptcy or false declarations.  


3. Where a procuring entity requires suppliers to satisfy conditions for participation, the entity shall publish a notice inviting suppliers to apply for participation.  The entity shall publish the notice sufficiently in advance to provide interested suppliers adequate time to prepare and submit responsive applications and for the entity to evaluate and make its determination based on such applications. 
Multi-Use Lists 

4. A procuring entity may establish a multi-use list provided that the entity annually publishes in a paper or electronic medium, or otherwise makes available continuously in electronic form, a notice inviting interested suppliers to apply for inclusion on the list. The notice shall include: 


(a) 	a description of the goods or services that may be procured using the list; 


(b) 	the conditions for participation to be satisfied by suppliers and the methods that the procuring entity will use to verify a supplier’s satisfaction of the conditions;

(d) 	the date on which use of the list will terminate, or where a date is not provided, an indication of the method by which advance notice will be given of the termination of use of the list;

12. Each Party shall provide that its judicial authorities have the authority to fine or imprison, in appropriate cases, a party to a litigation who fails to abide by valid orders issued by such authorities, and impose sanctions on parties to a litigation, their counsel, experts or other persons subject to the court’s jurisdiction, for violation of its orders regarding the protection of confidential information produced or exchanged in a proceeding.

16. In the event that judicial or other authorities appoint experts, technical or otherwise, that must be paid by a party to a litigation, such costs should be closely related, inter alia, to the quantity and nature of work to be performed and should not unreasonably deter recourse to such  proceedings. 
Provisional Measures 


17. Parties shall act upon requests for relief inaudita altera parte expeditiously and generally execute such requests within 10 days, except in exceptional cases. 


18. Each Party shall provide that its judicial authorities have the authority to require the plaintiff to provide any reasonably available evidence in order to satisfy themselves with a sufficient degree of certainty that the plaintiff's right is being infringed or that such infringement is imminent, and to order the plaintiff to provide a reasonable security or equivalent assurance set at a level sufficient to protect the defendant and to prevent abuse, and so as not to unreasonably deter recourse to such procedures.

 into free circulation is required to provide adequate evidence to satisfy the competent authorities that, under the laws of the country of importation, there is prima facie an infringement of the right holder's intellectual property right and to supply sufficient information that may reasonably be expected to be within the right holder’s knowledge to make the suspected goods reasonably recognizable by its competent authorities. The requirement to provide sufficient information shall not unreasonably deter recourse to these procedures.  Each Party shall provide that the application to suspend the release of goods shall remain in force for a period of not less than one year from the date of application, or the period that the good is protected by copyright or the relevant trademark registration is valid, whichever is shorter. 


21. Each Party shall provide that its competent authorities have the authority to require an applicant to provide a reasonable security or equivalent assurance sufficient to protect the defendant and the competent authorities and to prevent abuse. Each Party shall provide that such security or equivalent assurance shall not unreasonably deter recourse to these procedures.  Each Party may provide that such security may be in the form of a bond conditioned to hold the importer or owner of the imported merchandise harmless from any loss or damage resulting from any suspension of the release of goods in the event the competent authorities determine that the article is not an infringing copy. 


22. Where its competent authorities have made a determination that goods are counterfeit or pirated, each Party shall grant its competent authorities the authority to inform the right holder of the names and addresses of the consignor, the importer, and the consignee, and of the quantity of the goods in question. 


23. Each Party shall provide that its competent authorities may initiate border measures ex officio, with respect to imported, exported, or in transit merchandise, without the need for a formal complaint from a private party or right holder.    


24. Each Party shall provide that goods that have been determined to be pirated or counterfeit by the competent authorities shall be destroyed, except in exceptional cases. In regard to counterfeit trademark goods, the simple removal of the trademark unlawfully affixed shall not be sufficient to permit the release of the goods into the channels of commerce. In no event shall the competent authorities be authorized to permit the exportation of counterfeit or pirated goods, nor shall they be authorized to permit such goods to be subject to other customs procedures, except in exceptional circumstances. 
13  For the purposes of this paragraphs 20-25: 


(a) counterfeit trademark goods means any goods, including packaging, bearing without authorization a trademark that is identical to the trademark validly registered in respect of such goods, or that cannot be distinguished in its essential aspects from such a trademark, and that thereby infringes the rights of the owner of the trademark in question under the law of the country of importation; 


(b)  pirated copyright goods means any goods that are copies made without the consent of the right holder or person duly authorized by the right holder in the country of production and that are made directly or indirectly from an article where the making of that copy would have constituted an infringement of a copyright or a related right under the law of the country of importation. 
25. Where an application fee or merchandise storage fee is assessed, each Party shall provide that such fee shall not be set at an amount that unreasonably deters recourse to these procedures. 

Criminal Procedures and Remedies 


26. Each Party shall provide for criminal procedures and penalties to be applied at least in cases of willful trademark counterfeiting or copyright or related rights piracy on a commercial scale. Willful copyright or related rights piracy on a commercial scale includes (i) significant willful infringements of copyright or related rights that have no direct or indirect motivation of financial gain, as well as (ii) willful infringement for purposes of commercial advantage or private financial gain. Willful importation or exportation of counterfeit or pirated goods shall be treated as unlawful activities subject to criminal penalties to the same extent as the trafficking or distribution of such goods in domestic commerce. 


27. 	Specifically, each Party shall provide: 


(a) 	remedies that include sentences of imprisonment as well as monetary fines sufficient to provide a deterrent to future acts of infringement  consistent with a policy of removing the monetary incentive of the infringer. Each Party shall further establish policies or guidelines that encourage such fines to be imposed by judicial authorities at levels sufficient to provide a deterrent to future infringements;  


(b) 	that its judicial authorities have the authority to order the seizure of suspected counterfeit or pirated goods, any related materials and implements that have been used in the commission of the offense, any assets traceable to the infringing activity, and any documentary evidence relevant to the offense. Each Party shall provide that items that are subject to seizure pursuant to any such judicial order need not be individually identified so long as they fall within general categories specified in the order; 


(c) 	that its judicial authorities have the authority to order, among other measures, the forfeiture of any assets traceable to the infringing activity and shall, except in exceptional cases, order the forfeiture and destruction of all counterfeit or pirated goods, and, at least with respect to willful copyright or related rights piracy, materials and implements that have been used in the creation of the infringing goods. Each Party shall further provide that such forfeiture and destruction shall occur without compensation of any kind to the defendant; and 


(d) 	That its authorities may initiate legal action ex officio, without the need for a formal complaint by a private party or right holder. 

28. Each Party shall also provide for criminal procedures and penalties to be applied in the following cases, even absent willful trademark counterfeiting or copyright piracy: 


(a) 	the knowing trafficking in counterfeit labels affixed or designed to be affixed to a phonogram, to a copy of a computer program or to documentation or packaging for a computer program, or to a copy of a motion picture or other audiovisual work; and  


(b) 	the knowing trafficking in counterfeit documentation or packaging for a computer program.  
Limitations on Liability for Service Providers 

29. For the purpose of providing enforcement procedures that permit effective action against any act of infringement of copyright covered under this Chapter, including expeditious remedies to prevent infringements and criminal and civil remedies, each Party shall provide, consistent with the framework set forth in this Article:  


(a) 	legal incentives for service providers to cooperate with copyright
14 
owners in deterring the unauthorized storage and transmission of copyrighted materials; and 


(b) 	limitations in its law regarding the scope of remedies available against service providers for copyright infringements that they do not control, initiate or direct, and that take place through systems or networks controlled or operated by them or on their behalf, as set forth in this subparagraph (b).
15 



(i) 	These limitations shall preclude monetary relief and provide reasonable restrictions on court-ordered relief to compel or restrain certain actions for the following functions and shall be confined to those functions:
16 



(A) 	transmitting, routing, or providing connections for material without modification of its content, or the intermediate and transient storage of such material in the course thereof; 


(B) 	caching carried out through an automatic process; 


(C) 	storage at the direction of a user of material residing on a system or network controlled or operated by or for the service provider; and 


(D) 	referring or linking users to an online location by using information location tools, including hyperlinks and directories. 

(ii) 	These limitations shall apply only where the service provider does not initiate the chain of transmission of the material, and does not select the material or its recipients (except to the extent that a function described in clause (i)(D) in itself entails some form of selection). 
(iii) 	Qualification by a service provider for the limitations as to each function in clauses (i)(A) through (i)(D) shall be considered separately from qualification for the limitations as to each other function, in accordance with the conditions for qualification set forth in clauses (iv) – (vii).    

14  For purposes of this article, “copyright” shall also include related rights. 

15  It is understood that this subparagraph is without prejudice to the availability of defenses to copyright infringement that are of general applicability. 

16  Either Party may request consultations with the other Party to consider how to address future functions of a similar nature under this paragraph. 


(iv) 	With respect to functions referred to in clause (i)(B), the limitations shall be conditioned on the service provider:  


(A) 	permitting access to cached material in significant part only to users of its system network who have met conditions on user access to that material; 


(B) 	complying with rules concerning the refreshing, reloading, or other updating of the cached material when specified by the person making the material available online in accordance with a generally accepted industry standard data communications protocol for the system or network through which that person makes the material available; 


(C) 	not interfering with technology consistent with industry standards accepted in the territory of each Party used at the originating site to obtain information about the use of the material, and not modifying its content in transmission to subsequent users; and 


(D) 	expeditiously removing or disabling access, on receipt of an effective notification of claimed infringement, to cached material that has been removed or access to which has been disabled at the originating site. 

(v) 	With respect to functions referred to in clauses (i)(C) and (i)(D), the limitations shall be conditioned on the service provider: 


(A) 	not receiving a financial benefit directly attributable to the infringing activity, in circumstances where it has the right and ability to control such activity; 


(B) 	expeditiously removing or disabling access to the material residing on its system or network on obtaining actual knowledge of the infringement or becoming aware of facts or circumstances from which the infringement was apparent, such as through effective notifications of claimed infringement in accordance with clause (ix) and 


(C) 	publicly designating a representative to receive such notifications. 

(vi) 	Eligibility for the limitations in this subparagraph shall be conditioned on the service provider: 


(A) 	adopting and reasonably implementing a policy that provides for termination in appropriate circumstances of the accounts of repeat infringers; and   


(B) 	accommodating and not interfering with standard technical measures accepted in the territory of each Party that protect and identify copyrighted material, that are developed through an open, voluntary process by a broad consensus of copyright owners and service providers, that are available on reasonable and nondiscriminatory terms, and that do not impose substantial costs on service providers or substantial burdens on their systems or networks.  
(vii) 	Eligibility for the limitations in this subparagraph may not be conditioned on the service provider monitoring its service, or affirmatively seeking facts indicating infringing activity, except to the extent consistent with such technical measures. 

(viii) 	If the service provider qualifies for the limitations with respect to the function referred to in clause (i)(A), court-ordered relief to compel or restrain certain actions shall be limited to terminating specified accounts, or to taking reasonable steps to block access to a specific, non-domestic online location.  If the service provider qualifies for the limitations with respect to any other function in clause (i), court-ordered relief to compel or restrain certain actions shall be limited to removing or disabling access to the infringing material, terminating specified accounts, and other remedies that a court may find necessary, provided that such other remedies are the least burdensome to the service provider among comparably effective forms of relief.  Each Party shall provide that any such relief shall be issued with due regard for the relative burden to the service provider and harm to the copyright owner, the technical feasibility and effectiveness of the remedy and whether less burdensome, comparably effective enforcement methods are available.  Except for orders ensuring the preservation of evidence, or other orders having no material adverse effect on the operation of the service provider’s communications network, each Party shall provide that such relief shall be available only where the service provider has received notice of the court order proceedings referred to in this subparagraph and an opportunity to appear before the judicial authority. 


(ix) 	For purposes of the notice and take down process for the functions referred to in  clauses (i)(C) and (D), each Party shall establish appropriate procedures for effective notifications of claimed infringement, and effective counter-notifications by those whose material is removed or disabled through mistake or misidentification.  Each Party shall also provide for monetary remedies against any person who makes a knowing material misrepresentation in a notification or counter-notification that causes injury to any interested party as a result of a service provider relying on the misrepresentation.  


(x) 	If the service provider removes or disables access to material in good faith based on claimed or apparent infringement, each Party shall provide that the service provider shall be exempted from liability for any resulting claims, provided that, in the case of material residing on its system or network, it takes 

reasonable steps promptly to notify the person making the material available on its system or network that it has done so and, if such person makes an effective counter-notification and is subject to jurisdiction in an infringement suit, to restore the material online unless the person giving the original effective notification seeks judicial relief within a reasonable time.   

(xi) 	Each Party shall establish an administrative or judicial procedure enabling copyright owners who have given effective notification of claimed infringement to obtain expeditiously from a service provider information in its possession identifying the alleged infringer. 
(xii) 	For purposes of the function referred to in clause (i)(A), service provider means a provider of transmission, routing, or connections for digital online communications without modification of their content between or among points specified by the user of material of the user’s choosing, and for purposes of the functions referred to in clauses (i)(B) through (i)(D) service provider means a provider or operator of facilities for online services or network access.</article>

6. If the complaining Party cannot obtain the funds from the other Party’s escrow account within 30 days of the date on which payment is due, or if the other Party has not created an escrow account, the complaining Party may take other appropriate steps to collect the assessment or otherwise secure compliance.  These steps may include suspending tariff benefits under the Agreement as necessary to collect the assessment, while bearing in mind the Agreement’s objective of eliminating barriers to bilateral trade and while seeking to avoid unduly affecting parties or interests not party to the dispute.</article>
