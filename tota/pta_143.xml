  information to permit the notified Party to identify the
  anti-competitive business conduct that is the subject of the

  the domestic industry of like or directly competitive products in the
  importing Party, the importing Party may take emergency action to the
  minimum extent necessary to remedy or prevent the injury, subject to
  the provisions of this Article.

  2. Each Party shall ensure equitable, transparent and effective

  proceeding may be instituted by a petition or a complaint by an entity

  injury pursuant to an investigation conducted in accordance with
  definitions and procedures equivalent to those of Articles 3 and 4 of
  the WTO Agreement on Safeguards.

  4. The Party intending to take an emergency action under this Article
  shall, before taking an action, notify the other Parties and the Joint

  compensation in the form of substantially equivalent trade
  liberalization in relation to the imports from such Party.

  5. If the conditions in paragraph 1 are met, and following an
  examination by the Joint Committee as set out in paragraph 7,
   the importing Party may increase
  the rate of customs duty for the product to a level not to exceed the
  lesser of:

  a. the MFN rate of duty applied at the time the action is taken; or

  b. the MFN rate of duty applied on the day immediately preceding the
  date of the entry into force of this Agreement.

  6. An emergency action shall be taken for a period not exceeding three
  years, and shall not extend beyond the end of the transition period
  referred to in paragraph 9. No action shall be applied to the import
  of a product that has previously been the subject of such an action.

  7. The Joint Committee shall, within 30 days from the date of
  notification referred to in paragraph 4, examine the information
  provided under paragraph 4 in order to facilitate a mutually
  acceptable resolution of the matter. In the absence of such
  resolution, the importing Party may take an action in accordance with
  paragraph 5 and, in the absence of mutually agreed compensation, the
  Party against whose product the action is taken may take compensatory
  action. The emergency action and the compensatory action shall be
  immediately notified to the other Parties and the Joint Committee. In
  the selection of the emergency action and the compensatory action,
  priority must be given to the action which least disturbs the
  functioning of this Agreement. The compensatory action shall consist
  of suspension of tariff concessions under this Agreement having
  substantially equivalent trade effects or concessions substantially
  equivalent to the value of the additional duties expected to result
  from the emergency action. The Party taking compensatory action shall
  apply the action only for the minimum period necessary to achieve the
  substantially equivalent trade effects and in any event, only while
  the measure under paragraph 5 is being applied.

  8. Upon the termination of the emergency action, the rate of customs
  duty shall be the rate that would have been in effect but for the
  action.

  9. Unless extended by the Joint Committee as set out in paragraph 10,
  the transition period referred to in paragraphs 1 and 6 is the longer
  of:

  a. the five-year period beginning on the date of entry into force of
  this Agreement; or, where applicable,

  b. the staged tariff elimination set out for a product in a Party’s
  schedule in Annex E.

  10. In the fifth year after the date of entry into force of this
  Agreement, the Parties shall consider, in the Joint Committee, whether
  there is a need to extend the transition period for certain products.
  The Joint Committee may extend the transition period for a certain
  product, in which case the transition period for that product shall be
  in accordance with the decision of the Joint Committee.

  11. Each Party retains its rights and obligations under Article XIX of
  the GATT 1994 and the WTO Agreement on Safeguards.</article>

  the discretion of the complaining Party.

  2. Before Canada initiates against an EFTA State or an EFTA State
  initiates against Canada a dispute settlement proceeding in the WTO on
  grounds that are substantially equivalent to those available to that
  Party under this Agreement, that Party shall notify the other Parties
  of its intention. If an EFTA State initiates a dispute settlement
  proceeding against Canada and another EFTA State wishes also to have
  recourse to dispute settlement procedures against Canada as a
  complainant under this Agreement regarding the same matter, it shall
  inform promptly the notifying Party and those Parties shall consult
  with a view to agreeing on a single forum. If those Parties cannot
  agree, the dispute shall be settled under this Agreement.

  3. Once dispute settlement procedures have been initiated under this
  Agreement pursuant to Article 29 or dispute settlement proceedings

  interpretation and application of this Agreement, and shall make every
  attempt through co-operation and consultations to arrive at a mutually
  satisfactory resolution of any matter that might affect its operation.

  2. Canada may request in writing consultations with any EFTA State,

  regarding any actual or proposed measure or any other matter that it
  considers might affect the operation of this Agreement. The Party
  requesting consultations shall at the same time notify the other
  Parties in writing thereof and supply all relevant information. Where
  an EFTA State has requested consultations with Canada, any other EFTA
  State may join in such a request as a co-complainant.

  3. If any other Party so requests within ten days from the receipt of
  the notification referred to in paragraph 2, such Party shall be
  entitled to participate in the consultations.

  not been settled through consultations within 90 days from the date of
  the receipt of the request for consultation, may be referred to
  arbitration by one or more Parties to the dispute by means of a
  written notification addressed to the Party complained against. A copy
  of this notification shall be communicated to all Parties to this
  Agreement. Where more than one Party requests the submission to an
  arbitral tribunal of a dispute with the same Party relating to the
  same question, a single arbitral tribunal should be established to
  consider such disputes whenever feasible.

  2. The establishment and functioning of the arbitral tribunal are
  governed by AnnexK.

  3. Unless the Parties otherwise agree within 30 days from the date of
  the receipt of the notification referring the dispute to arbitration,
  the terms of reference shall be:

  Agreement, the matter referred to arbitration (as described in the
  notification referred to in paragraph 1) and to make such findings,
  determinations and recommendations as provided in paragraph 6 of
  Article 29 of this Agreement.”

  4. If the complaining Party alleges that any benefit it could
  reasonably have expected to accrue to it directly or indirectly under
  Articles 4, 5, 8, 10 or 11, is being nullified or impaired as a result
  of the application of any measure that is not inconsistent with this
  Agreement, the terms of reference shall so indicate.

  5. The arbitral tribunal shall interpret this Agreement in accordance
  with customary rules of interpretation of public international law.

  6. The arbitral tribunal, in its award, shall set out:

  inconsistent with the obligations of this Agreement or cause
  nullification or impairment of benefits within the meaning of
  paragraph 4, or any other determination requested in the terms of
  reference; and

  c. its recommendations, if any, for the resolution of the dispute and

  to agree on the implementation of the arbitral award, which, unless
  they decide otherwise by common accord, shall conform with the
  determinations and any recommendations of the arbitral tribunal. The
  disputing Parties shall notify the other Parties of any agreed
  resolution of the dispute.

  2. Wherever possible, the resolution shall be non-implementation or
  removal of a measure not conforming with this Agreement or causing
  nullification or impairment of benefits within the meaning of
  paragraph 4 of Article 29 or, failing such a resolution, compensation.</article>
      <article number="ARTICLE 31" name="Non-Implementation - Suspension Of Benefits" article_identifier="12310">1. In case of disagreement as to the existence or consistency of a
  measure implementing the arbitral award with the determinations and
  any  recommendations of the
  arbitral tribunal, such dispute shall be decided by the same arbitral
  tribunal before compensation can be sought or suspension of benefits
  can be applied in accordance with paragraphs 3 through 5. If one or
  more members of the original arbitral tribunal are not available, a
  new arbitral tribunal shall be established in accordance with Annex K,
  to make this determination.

  2. The complaining Party may not initiate arbitration under the
  preceding paragraph before a period of 12 months has expired following
  the rendering of the award pursuant to paragraph 6 of Article 29. The
  award of the tribunal referred to in the preceding paragraph shall
  normally be rendered within three months of the request for
  arbitration.

  3. If the arbitral tribunal, in accordance with paragraph 1 has
  determined that an implementing measure is inconsistent with the
  determinations and any 
  recommendations of the original arbitral tribunal, or that no
  implementing measures have been taken, and the Party complained
  against has not reached agreement with a complaining Party on a
  mutually satisfactory resolution within 30 days of receiving this
  award, the complaining Party may, until such time as the disputing
  Parties have reached agreement on a resolution of the dispute:

  a. seek compensation through an agreement with the Party complained
  against; or

  b. suspend the application to the Party complained against of benefits
  of equivalent effect.

  4. Upon written request of any disputing Party delivered to the other
  Party or Parties, the same arbitral tribunal shall be reconvened to
  determine whether the level of benefits suspended by a Party pursuant
  to paragraph 3 is of equivalent effect. If one or more members of the
  original arbitral tribunal are not available, a new arbitral tribunal
  shall be established in accordance with Annex K, to make this
  determination.

  5. The proceedings of the arbitral tribunal reconvened or established
  under paragraph 4 shall be conducted in accordance with paragraph 3 of
  Annex K. The arbitral tribunal shall present its determination within
  60 days after the date of the request referred to in paragraph 4, or
  such other period as the disputing Parties may agree.</article>
