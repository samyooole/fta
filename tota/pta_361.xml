By the Single Economic Space the Parties mean an economic environment that unites the customs territories of the Parties, in which operate the mechanisms of regulating the economies on the basis of uniform principles ensuring the free movement of goods, services, capital and labor, and in which is pursued a single foreign trade, tax, monetary and financial policy conciliated in the degree and in the scope that is necessary to ensure equal competition and to sustain macroeconomic stability.
  
The Parties shall strive to facilitate:
  
the development of trade and investment between the Parties, which would ensure the sustained development of the Parties’ economies on the basis of generally recognized principles and rules of international law as well as the rules and principles of the WTO;
    
the strengthening of the unity and development of economic potentials, as well as raising the competitiveness of the Parties’ economies on foreign markets.</article>
      <article number="ARTICLE 2" article_identifier="27351">The Parties shall deal with the stage-by-stage tasks of deepening integration by meeting their undertaken commitments and actually achieving the objectives of:
  
establishing a free trade area without exclusions and restrictions, which in mutual trade provides for the nonuse of antidumping, compensating and special protective measures on the basis of pursuing a uniform policy in tariff and nontarrif regulation, uniform rules of competition, application of subsidies and other forms of state support;
    
unifying the principles of the design and application of technical regulations and standards, sanitary and phytosanitary rules;
    
harmonizing macroeconomic policy;
    
creating conditions for the free movement of goods, services, capital and labor;

      <article number="ARTICLE 4" article_identifier="27353">Corresponding bodies whose structure is formed with allowance for the level of integration shall coordinate the processes of the establishment and operation of the SES.
  
The SES bodies shall be created on the basis of combining inter-state elements and principles of delegating a part of the Parties’ powers to a single regulating body with the gradual enhancement of the latter’s importance.
  
The Council of the Heads of States (hereinafter – CHS) shall ensure the coordination and management of the establishment and operation of the SES.
  
The number of votes of each member-state in the CHS shall be distributed by the principle of “one state – one vote.” The CHS decisions shall be made by consensus.
  
The Parties shall set up a single SES regulatory body, to which they shall delegate a part of their powers on the basis of international agreements. Its decisions shall be binding for execution by all the Parties.
