  accordance with Chapters 2 (Establishment), 3 (Cross-Border Supply of
  Services) and 4 (Temporary Presence of Natural Persons for Business
  Purposes), the Parties subscribe to the understanding set out in the
  following subparagraphs:

  (a) the CPC 84 code, used for describing computer and related
  services, covers the basic functions used to provide all computer and
  related services: computer programmes defined as the sets of
  instructions required to make computers work and communicate
  (including their development and implementation), data processing and
  storage, and related services, such as consultancy and training
  services for staff of clients. Technological developments have led to
  the increased offering of these services as a bundle or package of
  related services that can include some or all of these basic
  functions. For example, services such as web or domain hosting, data
  mining services and grid computing each consist of a combination of
  basic computer services functions;

  (b) computer and related services, regardless of whether they are
  delivered via a network, including the Internet, include all services
  that provide:

  (i) consulting, strategy, analysis, planning, specification, design,
  development, installation, implementation, integration, testing,
  debugging, updating, support, technical assistance, or management of
  or for computers or computer systems;

  (ii) computer programmes defined as the sets of instructions required
  to make computers work and communicate (in and of themselves), plus
  consulting, strategy, analysis, planning, specification, design,
  development, installation, implementation, integration, testing,
  debugging, updating, adaptation, maintenance, support, technical
  assistance, management or use of or for computer programmes;

  (iii) data processing, data storage, data hosting or database
  services;

  (iv) maintenance and repair services for office machinery and
  equipment, including computers; or

  (v) training services for staff of clients related to computer
  programmes, computers or computer systems, and not classified
  elsewhere;

  (c) computer and related services enable the provision of other
  services (e.g. banking) by both electronic and other means. However,
  there is an important distinction between the enabling service (e.g.
  web-hosting or application hosting) and the content or core service
  that is being delivered electronically (e.g. banking). In such cases,
  the content or core service is not covered by the CPC 84 code.

      <article number="ARTICLE 225" name="Requirements For Protection Of Designs" article_identifier="32784">1. Each Party shall provide for the protection of independently
  created designs that are new. When the legislation of a Party so
  provides, individual character of such designs may also be required.
  This protection shall be provided by registration and shall confer an
  exclusive right upon their holders in accordance with the provisions
  of this Section.

  2. A design applied to, or incorporated in, a product which
  constitutes a component part of a complex product shall only be
  considered protectable according to paragraph 1 if the component part,
  once it has been incorporated into the complex product [69], remains
  visible during normal use [70] of the latter, and to the extent that
  those visible features of the component part fulfil in themselves the
  requirements to be protectable.</article>
      <article number="ARTICLE 226" name="Rights Conferred By Registration" article_identifier="32785">1. The holder of a registered design shall have the exclusive right at
  least to prevent third parties not having his/her consent, from
  making, offering for sale, selling, importing, exporting, stocking
  such a product or using articles bearing or embodying the protected
  design when such acts are undertaken for commercial purposes.

  2. The holder of a registered design shall also have the right to take
  legal action against any person who produces or markets a product
  whose design only presents minor differences with respect to the
  protected design or where appearance is the same as the latter
  protected design.</article>
      <article number="ARTICLE 227" name="Term Of Protection" article_identifier="32786">The duration of protection of an industrial design shall amount to, at
  least, 10 years from the date of the submission of the application for
  registration. The Parties may implement a longer term of protection in
  their domestic legislation.</article>
      <article number="ARTICLE 228" name="Exceptions" article_identifier="32787">1. The Parties may establish limited exceptions to the protection of
  designs, provided that such exceptions do not unreasonably conflict
  with the normal exploitation of protected designs and do not
  unreasonably prejudice the legitimate interests of the owner of the
  protected design, taking account of the legitimate interests of third
  parties.

  2. Design protection shall not extend to designs dictated entirely by
  technical or functional considerations.

  3. A design right shall not subsist in features of appearance of a
  product which must necessarily be reproduced in their exact form and
  dimensions in order to permit the product in which the design is
  incorporated, or to which it is applied, to be mechanically connected
  to or placed in, around or against another product so that either
  product may perform its function.

  4. A design does not confer rights when it is contrary to public order
  or morality.</article>
      <article number="ARTICLE 229" name="Relationship To Copyright" article_identifier="32788">The subject matter of protection of a design right may be protected
  under copyright legislation if the conditions for such protection are
  met. The extent to which, and the conditions under which, such
  protection is conferred, including the level of originality required,
  shall be determined by each Party.

  Patents</article>
      <article number="ARTICLE 230" article_identifier="32789">1. The Parties shall comply with Articles 2 through 9 of the Budapest
  Treaty on the International Recognition of the Deposit of
  Microorganisms for the Purposes of Patent Procedure, done in Budapest
  on 28 April 1977 and amended on 26 September 1980.

  2. The European Union shall make all reasonable efforts to comply with
  the Patent Law Treaty, adopted at Geneva on 1 June 2000 (hereinafter
  referred to as the "PLT"). The signatory Andean Countries
  shall make all reasonable efforts to accede to the PLT.

  3. When the marketing of a pharmaceutical or agricultural chemical
  product [71] in a Party requires to obtain an authorisation by its
  competent authorities in such matters, such Party shall make its best
  efforts to process the corresponding application expeditiously with a
  view to avoiding unreasonable delays. The Parties shall cooperate and
  provide mutual assistance to achieve this objective.

  4. With respect to any pharmaceutical product that is covered by a
  patent, each Party may, in accordance with its domestic legislation,
  make available a mechanism to compensate the patent owner for
  unreasonable curtailment of the effective patent term resulting from
  the first marketing approval of that product in that Party. Such
  mechanism shall confer all of the exclusive rights of a patent,
  subject to the same limitations and exceptions applicable to the
  original patent.

  Protection of data of certain regulated products</article>
      <article number="ARTICLE 231" article_identifier="32790">1. Each Party shall protect undisclosed test or other data related to
  safety and efficacy of pharmaceutical products [72] and agricultural
  chemical products, in accordance with Article 39 of the TRIPS
  Agreement and its domestic legislation.

  2. According to paragraph 1, and subject to paragraph 4, when a Party
  requires, as a condition for approving the marketing of pharmaceutical
  or of agricultural chemical products which contain new chemical
  entities, the submission of undisclosed test or other data related to
  safety and efficacy, that Party shall grant an exclusivity period
  normally of five years from the date of marketing approval in the
  territory of that Party for pharmaceutical products, and 10 years for
  agricultural chemical products, period during which a third party may
  not commercialise a product based on such data, unless he/she presents
  proof of the explicit consent of the holder of the protected
  information or his/her own test data.

  3. For the purpose of this Article, a "new chemical entity"
  is the one which has not been previously approved in the territory of
  the Party for its use in a pharmaceutical or chemical agricultural
  product, pursuant to its domestic legislation. Accordingly, the
  Parties need not apply this Article with respect to pharmaceutical
  products that contain a chemical entity that has been previously
  approved in the territory of the Party.

  4. The Parties may regulate:

  (a) exceptions for reasons of public interest, situations of national
  emergency or extreme urgency, when it is necessary to allow access to
  those data to third parties; and

  (b) abbreviated marketing approval procedures in their territory,
  relying on a marketing approval granted by another Party. In such
  case, the period of exclusive use of the data submitted in connection
  with obtaining the approval shall begin from the date of the first
  marketing approval relied on, when the approval is granted within six
  months from the filing of a complete application.

  5. With regard to agricultural chemical products, the Parties may
  provide procedures which make it possible to remit or refer to the
  undisclosed information on safety and efficacy related to tests and
  studies that involve vertebrate animals. During the term of
  protection, the interested person in using such information shall
  compensate the holder of the protected information. The costs of such
  compensation shall be determined in a fair, equitable, transparent and
  non-discriminatory manner. The right to this compensation shall apply
  for as long as the protection of the undisclosed information on safety
  and efficacy lasts.

  6. In accordance with the provisions of Article 197 paragraph 5, the
  protection provided for in this Article does not prevent a Party from
  adopting measures in response to the abuse of intellectual property
  rights or practices which unreasonably restrain trade.

  Plant varieties</article>
      <article number="ARTICLE 232" article_identifier="32791">The Parties shall cooperate to promote and ensure the protection of
  plant varieties based on the International Convention for the
  Protection of New Varieties of Plants (hereinafter referred to as
  "UPOV Convention"), as revised on 19 March 1991, including
  the optional exception to the right of the breeder as referred to in
  Article 15(2) of such Convention.

  Unfair competition</article>
      <article number="ARTICLE 233" article_identifier="32792">1. Each Party shall grant effective protection against unfair
  competition in accordance with Article 10 bis of the Paris Convention.

  property in the course of trade that is contrary to honest commercial
  practices shall be considered unfair in accordance with the domestic
  legislation of each Party.

  2. In accordance with the domestic legislation of each Party, this
  Article may be applied without prejudice to the protection granted

  rights shall be fair and equitable and shall not be unnecessarily
  complicated or costly, or entail unreasonable time-limits or
  unwarranted delays.

  4. This Chapter does not create for the Parties any obligation to put

      <article number="ARTICLE 310" name="Temporary Remedies In Case Of Non-Compliance" article_identifier="32869">1. If the Party complained against does not notify the adoption of any
  measure to comply with the ruling of the arbitration panel before the
  expiry of the reasonable period, or if the arbitration panel decides
  according to Article 309 paragraph 2 that a notified measure is
  inconsistent with this Agreement, the complaining Party may:

  (a) request the Party complained against a compensation for
  non-compliance, either the continuation of the temporary compensation
  or a different compensation, or

  (b) notify the Party complained against and the Trade Committee its
  intention to suspend concessions resulting from any provision referred
  to in Article 299 to a level equivalent to the nullification or
  impairment caused by the violation.

  2. If following a period of 20 days after the expiry of the reasonable
  period, or following the decision by the arbitration panel that the
  measure notified under Article 311 paragraph 2 is inconsistent with
  this Agreement, the parties to the dispute are unable to reach an
  agreement about compensation under subparagraph 1(a), the complaining
  Party may notify the Party complained against and the Trade Committee
  of its intention to suspend benefits under any provision referred to
  in Article 299 in a level equivalent to the nullification or
  impairment caused by the violation.

  3. If the Party complained against does not implement the temporary
  compensation established under Article 308 within a reasonable period
  of time [88], the complaining Party may notify the Party complained
  against and the Trade Committee of its intention to suspend benefits
  under any provision referred to in Article 299 in a level equivalent
  to the temporary compensation pending the implementation of the
  temporary compensation or the adoption of a compliance measure by the
  Party complained against, whichever occurs first.

  4. When the complaining Party notifies its intention to suspend
  benefits under paragraphs 2 or 3, such Party may apply the suspension
  of benefits 10 days after the notification, unless the Party
  complained against requests arbitration under paragraph 5.

  5. If the Party complained against considers that the level of
  suspension notified is not equivalent to the nullification or
  impairment caused by the violation, it may request in writing to the
  original arbitration panel to decide on the matter. Such request shall
  be notified to the complaining Party and to the Trade Committee before
  the expiry of the 10-day period set out in paragraph 4. The original
  arbitration panel shall notify its ruling on the level of suspension
  of benefits to the parties to the dispute and to the Trade Committee
  within 30 days of the date when that arbitration panel has received
  the request. The benefits shall not be suspended until the original
  arbitration panel has notified its ruling to the parties to the
  dispute and any suspension shall comply with such ruling.

  6. In case the original arbitration panel, or any of its members, is
  not available, the procedures established in Article 303 shall apply.
  The ruling shall be issued within 45 days from the date of
  establishment of the new arbitration panel.

  7. The compensation or the suspension of benefits under this Article
  shall be temporary and shall not waive the obligation of the Party
  complained against of its obligation to comply with the ruling. Such
  remedies shall apply only until any measure declared inconsistent with
  this Agreement has been withdrawn or modified so as to comply with the
  provisions of this Agreement, or the parties to the dispute have
  reached a mutually agreed solution.</article>

  adopted to comply with the ruling of the arbitration panel and of its
  request to the complaining Party to terminate the suspension of
  benefits, or its intention to terminate the application of
  compensation for non-compliance, as the case may be. Except in the
  case provided for in paragraph 2, the suspension of benefits shall
  terminate 30 days following such notification.

  2. If the parties to the dispute are unable to reach an agreement on
  the compatibility of the notified measure with the provisions of this
  Agreement within 30 days from the date of the notification provided
  for under paragraph 1, any of such parties may submit a written
  request to the original arbitration panel to rule on the matter. Such
  request shall be notified simultaneously to the Party complained
  against and the Trade Committee. The arbitration ruling shall be
  notified to the parties to the dispute and the Trade Committee within
  45 days from the date of such request. If the arbitration panel
  decides that the compliance measure is compatible with the provisions
  of this Agreement, the suspension of benefits shall be terminated.

  3. In case the original arbitration panel, or any of its members, is
  not available, the procedures established in Article 303 shall apply.
  The ruling shall be notified within 45 days from the date of
  establishment of a new arbitration panel.

  the parties to the dispute has requested the original arbitration
  panel to decide on the consistency of the measure notified under
  paragraph 1, and the complaining Party has not complied with its
  obligation of terminating the suspension of benefits, the Party
  complained against may suspend benefits at a level equivalent to that
  applied by the complaining Party, while such Party continues to
  suspend benefits.</article>

  origin, manifests, shippers' export declarations, or any other customs

  355(6) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union as of

  the European Union changes its status as such by the same procedure,

  European Council decision. The EU Party will notify the other Parties
  any modification of the territories considered outermost regions of
  the European Union.

  a Party shall be understood as the nationality of the Party in which
  the natural person has stronger ties, considering factors such as,
  among others, his/her habitual residence, his/her family links,
  his/her place of taxation or the place where he/she exercises his/her
  political rights.

  Andean Country or a Member State of the European Union and another
  port or point located in the same signatory Andean Country or Member
  State of the European Union, including on its continental shelf, and
  traffic originating and terminating in the same port or point located
  in a signatory Andean Country or a Member State of the European Union.

  [24] Subparagraphs 2(a), 2(b) and 2(c) do not cover measures taken in
  order to limit the production of an agricultural product.

  [25] Each Party may require that in the case of constitution of
  juridical person under its own law, investors must adopt a specific

  non-discriminatory manner, it does not need to be specified in Annex
  VII (List of commitments on establishment) in order to be maintained
  or adopted by the Parties.

  [26] For greater certainty, the term "like" is without

  European Union.

  inputs for the supply of services.

  [36] For purposes of this subparagraph, "professional
  experience" means that obtained after having reached the age of

  between Colombia and the EU Party.

  [40] The term "relevant international organisations" refers
  to international bodies whose membership is open to the relevant
  bodies of the Parties.

  [41] In Colombia, the official postal operator or concessionary is a
  juridical person which supplies the universal postal service under a
  concession contract. The remaining postal services are subject to an
  expedited licensing regime administered by the Ministry of Information
  and Communications Technology. In Peru, the designated postal operator
  is a juridical person which under a concession granted by law, and
  with no exclusivity, has the obligation to supply the postal service
  in the whole country. The other postal services are subject to a

  Telecommunications of the GATS.

  and the EU Party under this Agreement without prejudice to the

  measures that prevent a monetary transfer through the equitable,
  non-discriminatory and good faith application of Peruvian Laws
  relating to:(a)bankruptcy, insolvency, or the protection of the rights
  of creditors;(b)issuing, trading, or dealing in securities, futures,
  options, or derivatives;(c)criminal or penal offences;(d)financial
  reporting or record keeping of transfers when necessary to assist law
