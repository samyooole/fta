    <chapter number="CHAPTER 1" name="Customs Duties And Non-Tariff Measures" chapter_identifier="3373">
      <article number="ARTICLE 10" name="Customs Duties" article_identifier="28389">1. The term "customs duties" refers to the duties or charges
  of any kind imposed on or in connection with the importation or
  exportation of goods, as provided for in the WTO rules.

  This provision shall not be interpreted as applying to internal duties
  or charges or duties or charges having equivalent effect at the moment
  of leaving the territory.

  2. For each product, the basic customs duty to which the successive
  reductions apply shall be that specified in the tariff dismantling
  schedules of each Party.</article>
      <article number="ARTICLE 11" name="Fees And Other Charges" article_identifier="28390">The Parties reaffirm their commitment to complying with the provisions
  of Article VIII of GATT 1994.</article>

  shall be conferred on goods meeting the rules of origin in force on 1
  January 2008 on the territory of the Parties.

  2. The Parties shall establish a reciprocal common regime governing
  the rules of origin by 31 July 2008 at the latest, based on the rules
  of origin set out in the Cotonou Agreement and providing for their
  simplification, in view of the Ivorian Party's development objectives.
  The new regime shall be part of this Agreement by decision of the EPA
  Committee. Failing agreement between the Parties, the applicable
  regime shall be the most favourable regime to Côte d'Ivoire of either
  the current regime adopted by the EC Party or the improved rules
  established under the Cotonou Agreement.

  3. At the latest three years after the date of entry into force of
  this Agreement, the Parties shall revise the provisions in force
  governing the rules of origin with the common aim of simplifying the
  concepts and methods used to determine origin in the light of the
  development objectives of Côte d'Ivoire and in line with those of West
  Africa. In the context of this revision, the Parties shall take
  account of technological development, production procedures and all
  other factors, including current reforms of the rules of origin which
  could require consequent amendments to the negotiated reciprocal
  regime. All amendments or replacements shall be made pursuant to a
  decision by the EPA Committee.</article>
      <article number="ARTICLE 15" name="Standstill" article_identifier="28394">1. No new customs duties on imports shall be introduced in trade
  between the Parties, nor shall those currently applied in trade
  between the Parties be increased from the date of entry into force of
  this Agreement.

  2. Notwithstanding paragraph 1, and as part of the finalisation of the
  common external tariff of the Economic Community Of West African
  States (ECOWAS), Côte d'Ivoire may until 31 December 2011 revise its
  basic customs duties on goods originating in the European Community
  insofar as the general impact of these duties is no higher than that
  resulting from the duties specified in Annex 2. The EPA Committee
  shall amend Annex 2 accordingly.</article>
      <article number="ARTICLE 16" name="Duties, Taxes And Other Fees And Charges On Exports" article_identifier="28395">1. No new customs duties on exports or charges with equivalent effect
  shall be introduced, nor shall those currently applied in trade
  between the Parties be increased from the date of entry into force of
  this Agreement.

  2. In exceptional circumstances, if the Ivorian Party can justify
  specific needs for income, protection for infant industry or
  environmental protection, it may, on a temporary basis and after
  consulting the EC Party, introduce customs duties on exports or
  charges with equivalent effect on a limited number of traditional
  goods or increase the incidence of those which already exist.

  3. The Parties agree to review the provisions of this Article in the
  framework of the EPA Committee at the latest three years after entry
  into force of this Agreement, taking full account of their impact on
  the development and diversification of the economy of the Ivorian
  Party.</article>
      <article number="ARTICLE 17" name="More Favourable Treatment Resulting From Free-Trade Agreements" article_identifier="28396">1. For the fields covered by this Chapter, the EC Party shall grant
  the Ivorian Party any more favourable treatment applicable as a result
  of the European Community becoming party to a free-trade agreement
  with third parties after signing this Agreement.

  2. For the fields covered by this Chapter, the Ivorian Party shall
  grant the EC Party any more favourable treatment applicable as a
  result of Côte d'Ivoire entering into a free-trade agreement with a
  major trade partner after signing this Agreement.

  3. If the Ivorian Party obtains from a major trade partner
  substantially more favourable treatment than that offered by the EC
  Party, the Parties shall consult each other and decide together on the
  implementation of the provisions in paragraph 2.

  4. The provisions of this Chapter cannot be interpreted as requiring
  the Parties to reciprocally grant each other preferential treatment
  which would be applicable owing to one of the Parties being signatory
  to a free-trade agreement with a third party on the date on which this
  Agreement enters into force.

  5. In this Article, "free-trade agreement" refers to an
  agreement which substantially liberalises trade and substantially
  eliminates discrimination between the parties through the repeal of
  existing discriminatory measures and/or the prohibition of new
  discriminatory measures and measures which are more discriminatory in
  nature, either on the entry into force of this Agreement or on the
  basis of a reasonable timetable.

  6. In this Article, "major trade partner" refers to any
  developed country, or any country with a share in world trade greater
  than 1 per cent in the year preceding the entry into force of the
  free-trade agreement mentioned in paragraph 2, or any group of
  countries acting individually, collectively or through a free-trade
  agreement with a share in world trade greater than 1,5 per cent in the
  year preceding the entry into force of the free-trade agreement
  mentioned in paragraph 2 [2].</article>
      <article number="ARTICLE 18" name="Prohibition Of Quantitative Restrictions" article_identifier="28397">Notwithstanding the provisions of Articles 23, 24 and 25, on the entry
  into force of this Agreement, all prohibitions or restrictions on
  importation or exportation affecting trade between the Parties shall
  be eliminated, with the exception of the customs duties, taxes, fees
  and other charges referred to in Article 11, irrespective of whether
  they are implemented through quotas, import or export licensing or
  other measures. No new measures shall be introduced.</article>
      <article number="ARTICLE 19" name="National Treatment Of Internal Taxation And Regulation" article_identifier="28398">1. Products imported from the other Party shall not be directly or
  indirectly subject to internal taxation or other internal charges of
  any type surpassing those which are directly or indirectly applicable
  to similar domestic products. Furthermore, both Parties shall refrain
  from applying any other form of taxation or other internal charges
  with the aim of providing protection for domestic production.

  2. Products imported from the other Party shall benefit from treatment
  which is no less favourable than the treatment given to similar
  domestic products in respect of all laws, regulations and requirements
  applicable to their sale, offering for sale, purchase, transportation,
  distribution or use on the national market. The provisions of this
  paragraph shall not prevent the application of tariffs for
  differentiated internal transportation based exclusively on the
  fuel-efficient use of transport and not on the origin of the product.

  3. Notwithstanding the provisions on the rules of origin, each Party
  shall refrain from establishing or maintaining any internal
  regulations relating to the mixing, processing or use of products
  according to specified quantities or proportions which would require,
  directly or indirectly, that any specified amount or proportion of the
  product subject to the regulation in question be supplied from
  internal sources. Furthermore, each Party shall refrain from applying
  any other form of domestic quantitative regulation with the aim of
  providing protection for domestic production.

  4. The provisions of this Article shall not apply to the laws,
  regulations, procedures or practices relating to public procurement.

  5. The provisions of this Article shall be without prejudice to
  Chapter 2 concerning trade defence instruments.

  6. For matters relating to the payment of subsidies to national
  producers, the Parties shall refer to the WTO.</article>
      <article number="ARTICLE 20" name="Food Security" article_identifier="28399">Where the implementation of this Agreement leads to difficulties
  regarding the availability of, or access to, foodstuffs necessary to
  ensure food security, and where this situation gives rise to or is
  likely to give rise to major difficulties for Côte d'Ivoire, the
  latter may take appropriate measures in accordance with the procedures
  laid down in Article 25.</article>
      <article number="ARTICLE 21" name="Special Provisions On Administrative Cooperation" article_identifier="28400">1. The Parties agree that administrative cooperation is essential to
  the implementation and control of the preferential treatment granted
  in this Chapter and underline their commitment to combating
  irregularities and fraud as regards customs and related fields.

  2. When a Party obtains proof from objective information of a lack of
  administrative cooperation and/or irregularities or fraud, this Party
  may temporarily suspend the preferential treatment granted to the
  product(s) concerned in accordance with this Article.

  3. For the purposes of this Article, a lack of administrative
  cooperation shall include the following:

  (a) repeated failure to comply with the obligation to verify the
  originating status of the product(s) concerned;

  (b) repeated refusal to conduct a subsequent check of proof of origin
  and communicate the results, or undue delay in doing so;

  (c) repeated refusal to grant authorisation for a cooperation mission
  to check the authenticity of documents or the accuracy of information
  of relevance to the preferential treatment in question, or undue delay
  in doing so.

  4. The application of a temporary suspension shall be subject to the
  following conditions:

  (a) A Party which obtains proof from objective information of a lack
  of administrative cooperation and/or irregularities or fraud must
  notify the EPA Committee without undue delay that it has obtained the
  proof and the objective information, and must consult with the EPA
  Committee to find a solution acceptable to both Parties, drawing on
  all relevant information and objective evidence;

  (b) When the Parties have entered into consultation with the EPA
  Committee, as provided for above, and have been unable to agree on an
  acceptable solution in the three months following notification, the
  Party concerned can temporarily suspend the preferential treatment
  granted to the product(s) concerned. The EPA Committee must be

  safeguard measures of limited duration which derogate from the
  provisions of Articles 12 and 13, under the conditions of, and in
  accordance with, the procedures laid down by this Article.

  2. The safeguard measures referred to in paragraph 1 may be taken
  where a product originating in one Party is imported into the
  territory of the other Party in such increased quantities and under
  such conditions as to cause or threaten to cause:

  (a) serious injury to the domestic industry of similar or directly
  competitive products in the territory of the importing Party;

  (b) disruptions in a sector of the economy, particularly where these
  disruptions produce major social problems or difficulties which could
  bring about serious deterioration in the economic situation of the
  importing Party; or

  (c) disruptions in the markets for similar or directly competitive
  agricultural products [3] or of the mechanisms regulating these
  markets in the territory of the importing Party.

  3. The safeguard measures referred to in this Article shall not exceed
  that which is strictly necessary to prevent or remedy serious injury
  or disruptions as defined in paragraphs 2, 4 and 5. These safeguard
  measures of the importing Party may consist only of one or more of the
  following:

  (a) the suspension of any further reduction in the customs duty on
  imports applicable for the product concerned, as provided for by this
  Agreement;

  (b) an increase in the customs duty on the product concerned up to a
  level which does not exceed the customs duty applied to other WTO
  Members, and

  (c) the introduction of tariff quotas on the product concerned.

  4. Notwithstanding paragraphs 1 and 2, when a product originating in
  Côte d'Ivoire is imported in such increased quantities and under such
  conditions as to cause or threaten to cause one of the situations
  described in paragraphs 2(a), (b) and (c) in one or more outermost
  regions of the EC Party, the EC Party may take surveillance or
  safeguard measures, as provided for in paragraph 3, limited to the
  region(s) concerned and in accordance with the procedures defined in
  paragraphs 6 to 9.

  5. (a) When a product originating in the EC Party is imported in such
  increased quantities and under such conditions as to cause or threaten
  to cause one of the situations described in paragraphs 2(a), (b) and
  (c), Côte d'Ivoire may take surveillance or safeguard measures limited
  to its territory in accordance with the procedures defined in
  paragraphs 6 to 9;

  (b) Notwithstanding paragraphs 1 and 2, Côte d'Ivoire may take
  safeguard measures as provided for in paragraph 3 when a product
  originating in the EC Party is imported in such increased quantities
  and under such conditions as to cause or threaten to cause
  disturbances to an infant industry producing similar or directly
  competitive products.

  Such provision shall be applicable only for a period of ten years from
  the date of entry into force of this Agreement. However, this period
  may be extended subject to an agreement between the Parties when,
  despite the development potential of the industry and the efforts
  actually made, this objective has not been achieved owing in
  particular to the world economic situation or to serious problems
  affecting Côte d'Ivoire.

  The measures must be taken in compliance with the provisions of
  paragraphs 6 to 9.

  6. (a) The safeguard measures referred to in this Article shall be
  maintained only for the period necessary to prevent or resolve serious
  damage or disruptions such as those described in paragraphs 2, 4 and
  5;

  (b) The safeguard measures referred to in this Article shall be
  applied for a period not exceeding two years. Where the circumstances
  warranting the imposition of safeguard measures continue to exist,
  such measures may be extended for a further period of no more than two
  years. Where Côte d'Ivoire applies a safeguard measure, or where the
  EC Party applies a measure limited to the territory of one or more of
  its outermost regions, this measure may nevertheless be applied for a
  period of no more than four years and, when the circumstances
  justifying the imposition of safeguard measures continue to exist, be
  extended for a further four-year period;

  (c) The safeguard measures referred to in this Article which exceed
  one year shall be accompanied by clear evidence of a progressive move
  towards eliminating the causes of the damage and disruptions and the
  measures at the latest by the end of the established period;

  (d) Except in exceptional circumstances subject to the assessment of
  the EPA Committee, no safeguard measures referred to in this Article
  shall be applied to a product which has previously been subject to
  such a measure for a period of at least one year from the date of
  expiry of this measure.

  7. The following provisions shall apply for implementation of
  paragraphs 1 to 6:

  (a) When a Party considers that one of the circumstances referred to
  in paragraphs 2, 4 and/or 5 exists, it shall immediately refer the
  matter to the EPA Committee;

  (b) The EPA Committee can make any necessary recommendation to remedy
  the circumstances which have arisen. Where the EPA Committee has not
  made recommendations to remedy the circumstances, or where a
  satisfactory solution has not been found in the 30 days following
  notification to this Committee, the importing Party may adopt
  appropriate measures to remedy the circumstances, in accordance with
  this Article;

  (c) Before taking a measure provided for in this Article or, in the
  cases referred to in paragraph 8, as soon as possible, the Party
  concerned shall communicate to the EPA Committee all information which
  can be used for a full examination of the situation with a view to
  finding an acceptable solution for the Parties;

  (d) When selecting safeguard measures, priority must be given to those
  which help to efficiently and rapidly solve the problem, while causing
  the least possible disruption to the smooth functioning of this
  Agreement;

  (e) All safeguard measures taken in accordance with this Article shall
  be notified immediately to the EPA Committee and shall be the subject
  of periodic consultations within that body, particularly with a view
  to establishing a timetable for their abolition as soon as
  circumstances permit.

  8. Where exceptional circumstances require immediate action, the
  importing Party concerned, whether the EC Party or Côte d'Ivoire, as
  the case may be, may take the measures provided for in paragraphs 3, 4
  and/or 5 on a provisional basis and without meeting the requirements
  of paragraph 7. Such action may be taken for a maximum period of 180
  days where the measures are taken by the EC Party and 200 days when
  the measures are taken by Côte d'Ivoire, or when the measures of the
  EC Party are limited to one or more of its outermost regions. The
  duration of such provisional measures shall be counted as a part of
  the initial period or of any extension referred to in paragraph 6.
  When taking these provisional measures, the interests of all
  stakeholders must be taken into account. The importing party concerned
  shall inform the other Party and immediately refer the matter to the
  EPA Committee for examination.

  9. If an importing party subjects imports of a product to an
  administrative procedure having as its purpose the rapid provision of
  information on the trend of trade flows liable to give rise to the
  problems referred to in this Article, it shall inform the EPA
  Committee without delay.
