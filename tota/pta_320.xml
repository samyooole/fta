The Contracting Parties thereby affirm their undertaking to 
continue, strengthen and render more effective the system of 
co-operation established under the first and second ACP-EEC 
Conventions and confirm the special character of their relations, 
based on their reciprocal interest, and the specific nature of 
their co-operation. 


The Contracting Parties hereby express their resolve to 
intensify their effort to create, with a view to a more Just

    <chapter number="CHAPTER 2" name="Drought And Desertification Control" chapter_identifier="2776">
      <article number="ARTICLE 38" article_identifier="22981">1. The ACP States and the Community recognize that the 
physical, economic and political existence of certain 
ACP States is threatened by endemic drought and growing 
desertification, which destroy all efforts at development, in 
particular those aimed at achieving the priority objective of 
self-sufficiency and food security. 



2. The two parties agree that in a number of ACP States 
control of drought and desertification constitutes a pressing 

•and imperative need for the success of any development 
undertaking. 


3. The same will apply eventually to the States bordering the 
affected areas, for which this phenomenon represents a real 
threat to their fragile social and ecological equilibrium.</article>
      <article number="ARTICLE 39" article_identifier="22982">The two parties recognize that halting the deterioration of 
land and forest potential, re-establishing ecological 
equilibria, protecting natural resources and exploiting them 
efficiently constitute, inter alia, fundamental objectives 
which the ACP States concerned endeavour to attain with the 
support of the Community, notably in order to improve their 
peoples' living conditions.</article>
      <article number="ARTICLE 40" article_identifier="22983">1. The scale, in space and time, of the phenomenon and also 
of the resources to be deployed, means that the operations to 
be undertaken must form part of overall, long-term policies 
designed and applied by the ACP States at national, regional 
and international level in the context of international 
solidarity. 



2. To this effect, the two parties agree to lay stress on the 
implementation of campaigns with specific themes backed up not 
only by the resources of this Convention, but also by all other 
means of support that can be mobilized. 



3. Remedying the situation of countries affected or 
threatened by these calamities, and promoting their lasting 
development, calls for a genuine policy to encourage the 
restoration of natural balances by means of better water 
control and a campaign against practices encouraging the 
appearance and development of the phenomenon of desertification.</article>
      <article number="ARTICLE 41" article_identifier="22984">The operations to be undertaken, where necessary with research 
backing, shall cover, inter alia: 


1) improving man's knowledge of, and ability to forecast, 
desertification phenomena by observing developments in the 
field, by making use of results achieved and gaining a better 
understanding of the changes to the human environment in 
time and space; 


2) making an inventory of water-tables and of their 
replenishment capacity with a view to better predictability 
of water supplies, using surface and groundwater and 
improving management of these resources for the purpose of 
satisfying the needs of people and animals, and improving 
weather forecasting; 


3) establishing a system for the prevention and control of 
bush fires and deforestation.</article>
      <article number="ARTICLE 42" article_identifier="22985">If a return to the natural balance is to be expected, a 
"drought and desertification control" component in particular 
must be incorporated into all agricultural and rural 
development operations, such as: 


1) - the extension of agro-forestry systems combining farming 
and forestry, research and development activities to 
produce plant species that are more adapted to local 
conditions ; 



- the introduction of suitable techniques aimed at 
increasing and maintaining the productivity of 
agricultural land, arable land and natural pastureland 
with a view to controlling the various forms of erosion; 



- the reclamation of land that has deteriorated, by means 
of reafforestation or agricultural land improvement, 
combined with maintenance schemes involving, as far as 
possible, the people and authorities concerned in order 
to safeguard the progress made ; 

2) the encouragement of measures to economize on wood as an 
energy source by stepping up research, application of, and 
information on, new and renewable sources of energy such as 
wind, solar and biomass energy, and by the use of improved 
stoves with a greater heat yield ; 


3) the development and management of forestry resources by 
setting up, at national or regional level, forestry 
management plans aimed at optimizing the exploitation of 
forestry resources ; 


4) the pursuit of ongoing campaigns to educate the people 
concerned to be aware of the phenomena of drought and 
desertification and to train them in the possible ways of 
controlling them.</article>

Convention is to promote trade between the ACP States and the 
Community, taking account of their respective levels of develop
ment, and also between the ACP States themselves. 



2. In the pursuit of this objective, particular regard shall 
be had to securing effective additional advantages for the 
ACP States' trade with the Community and to improving the 
conditions of access for their products to the market in order 
to accelerate the growth of their trade and, in particular, of 
the flow of their exports to the Community and to ensure a 
better balance in the trade of the Contracting Parties. 



3. To this end, the Contracting Parties shall apply the 
provisions of this Title and the other appropriate measures 
under Title III of this Part and under Part Two of this 
Convention.</article>
      <article number="ARTICLE 130" article_identifier="23072">1. Products originating in the ACP States shall be imported 
into the Community free of customs duties and charges having 
equivalent effect. 



2. (a) Products originating in the ACP States:

rules introduced as a result of the implementation of 
the common agricultural policy, 

shall be imported into the Community, notwithstanding 


the general arrangements applied in respect of third 


countries, in accordance with the following provision


(i) those products shall be imported free of customs 
duties for which Community provisions in.force at 
the time of import do not provide, apart from 
customs duties, for the application of any measure 
relating to their import; 



(ii) for products other than those referred to under (i), 
the Community shall take the necessary measures to. 
ensure more favourable treatment than that granted 
to third countries benefiting from the most
favoured-nation clause for the same products.

ACP States request that new lines of agricultural 
production or agricultural products which are not the 
subject of specific arrangements when this Convention 
enters into force should benefit from such arrangements, 
the Community shall examine these requests in consul
tation with the ACP States. 



(c) Notwithstanding the above, the Community shall, in the 
context of the special relations and special nature of 
ACP-EEC co-operation, examine on a case-by-case basis the 
requests from the ACP States for preferential access for 
their agricultural products to the Community market and 
shall notify its decision on these reasoned requests 
within a period not exceeding six months of the date of 
their submission.

Community shall take its decisions in particular with 


reference to concessions granted to developing third 


countries. It shall take account of the possibilities 


offered by the off-season market.

rehabilitation, maintenance and rationalization programmes 
to complement the efforts made by the ACP State concerned 
to restore the affected production and export capacity to 
a viable level, with special attention being paid to 
integrating it satisfactorily in the country's overall 
development process. Where it would appear impossible to 
restore such capacity to a viable state, the ACP State 
concerned and the Commission shall seek projects or 
programmes best suited to attaining the objectives of the 
system. 


Where Articles 179(1) (b) and 180(b) are applied, the 
resources of the special financing facility shall be used 
as a matter of priority to support the efforts the ACP 
State concerned deploys to avoid interruption of the 
development projects referred to in Article 179 or to 
promote projects that would replace, even partially, 
the mining capacities lost as a source of export earnings. 


The amount of this aid shall be determined by the Commission 
in the light of the funds available under the special 
financing facility, the nature of the projects or programmes 
proposed by the ACP State concerned and the possibilities 
for co-financing. 


In determining the amount, account shall be taken of the 


scale of the reduction in production or export capacity, 


and of the losses of earnings suffered by the ACP States 


as identified in Article 179 and of the relative importance 


of the mining industry affected for the ACP State's export 


earnings. 


Under no circumstances may a single ACP State be eligible 
for more than 35% of the funds available under an annual 
instalment. This percentage shall be 15% for a contribution 
on the basis of Articles 179(1)(b) and 180(b). 


The procedures applicable to assistance in the above 
circumstances and the implementing arrangements shall be

for in Article 203. 



2. Since an advance is granted as a means of prefinancing 
projects or programmes which it precedes or to which it is 
preparatory, account shall be taken of the scale and 
nature of those projects or programmes when the amount of 
the advance is fixed. 



3. The advance shall take the form of supplies or of the 
provision of services, or of cash payments if this arrangement 
is considered more appropriate.

      <article number="ARTICLE 197" article_identifier="23139">1. Projects or programmes may be financed by grant, or by 
special loan, or by risk capital, or by loans from the Bank 
from its own resources, or jointly by two or more of these 
means of financing. 



2. For resources of the Fund administered by the Commission, 
the methods of financing for each project or programme shall 
be decided jointly by the Community and the ACP State or 
States concerned by reference to the level of development and 
the geographical, economic and financial situation of these 
States. Account shall also be taken of the economic, social 
and cultural impact of the methods of financing. 



3. For resources of the Fund administered by the Bank, the 
methods of financing shall be fixed in close consultation with 
the ACP State concerned or the beneficiary on the basis of the 
economic and financial characteristics of the project or 
programme in question and the stage of development and 
economic and financial situation of the ACP State or States 
concerned. 



4. For the Bank's own resources, the methods of financing 
shall be decided by reference to the nature of the project, 
the prospects for its economic and financial return and the 
stage of development and economic and financial situation of 
the ACP State or States concerned. Account shall be taken in 
addition of factors guaranteeing the servicing of repayable 
aid. Examination by the Bank of the admissibility of projects 
and the granting of loans from its own resources shall be 
carried out in consultation with the ACP State or States 
concerned in accordance with the detailed rules, conditions 
and procedures laid down in its Statute and in this Convention. 



5. The Bank's task in the ACP States shall be to 
contribute, through its own resources, to the economic and 
industrial development of the ACP States on a national and 
regional scale. To this end, the financing of productive 
projects and programmes in industry, agro-industry, tourism 
and mining, and in energy production, transport and tele
communications linked to these sectors shall be undertaken in 
the first place by the Bank with loans from its own 
resources or risk capital. These sectoral priorities shall 
not exclude the possibility of the Bank's financing, from its 
own resources, productive projects and programmes in other 
sectors which satisfy its criteria for making contributions, 
in particular in the area of commercial agriculture. 



6. Where a request for the financing of a project or 
programme is submitted to the Commission or to the Bank, and 
it is found that such project or programme could not be 
financed by one of the forms of aid administered by the 
institution, the latter shall, having informed the potential 
recipient, transmit the request without delay to the other 
institution. 



7. Grants or loans may be accorded to an ACP State, or direct 
to the recipient, or via a development bank, or may be 
channelled by the ACP State to a final recipient.

may be made available by the ACP State to the final recipient 
shall be laid down in the financing agreement or loan 
contract. 



9. In the course of its financial operations, the Bank shall 
establish close links with the national development banks of 
the ACP States. In the interests of co-operation, it shall 
endeavour to make all appropriate contacts with banking and 
financial institutions in the ACP countries concerned by its 
operations. 



10. Any profit accruing to the ACP State because it receives 
either a grant or a special loan for which the interest rate 
or the repayment period is more favourable than that of the 
final loan shall be used by the ACP State for development 
purposes on the conditions laid down in the financing 
agreement or loan contract. 



11. Special treatment shall be accorded to the least-
developed ACP States when determining the volume of the 
financial resources which such States may expect from the 
Community for the purpose of their indicative programmes. In 
addition, account shall be taken of the particular 
difficulties of the landlocked or island ACP States. These 
financial resources shall be combined with particularly 
favourable terms of financing, having regard to the economic 
situation and the nature of the needs specific to each 
State. They shall consist essentially of grants, and, in 
appropriate cases, of special loans, or risk capital or loans 
from the Bank, having regard to the criteria laid down in 
paragraph 4.</article>
      <article number="ARTICLE 198" article_identifier="23140">At the request of the ACP States, the Community shall lend

Risk capital</article>
      <article number="ARTICLE 199" article_identifier="23141">1. With a view to aiding the implementation of operations 
of general interest to the economy of the ACP States, the 
Community may contribute to the formation of risk capital 
which may be used inter alia for: 



(a) increasing directly or indirectly the own resources, or 
resources treated as such, of public, semi-public or 
private enterprises and granting quasi-capital assistance 
to such enterprises; 



(b) financing specific studies for the preparation and the 
drawing up of projects and providing assistance to enter
prises during the start-up period or for rehabilitation 
purposes; 



(c) financing research and investment in preparation for the 
launching of projects and programmes in the mining and 
energy sectors. 

- 199 2.(a) To attain these objectives, risk capital may be used 
to acquire temporary minority holdings on behalf of the 
Community in the capital of the enterprises concerned 
or in that of institutions specialized in the financing 
of development in the ACP States. Such holdings may be 
acquired in conjunction with a loan from the Bank or 
with another form of risk-capital assistance. Once the 
conditions are met, the holdings shall be transferred, 
preferably to nationals or institutions of the 
ACP States. 


(b) Financing decisions relating to risk capital shall be 
taken by the Community within the framework of 
Article 220(5) to (8). 


3. Quasi-capital assistance may take the form of: 



(a) subordinated loans, which shall be redeemed and in 
respect of which interest, if any, shall be paid only 
after other bank claims have been settled; 



(b) conditional loans, the repayment or duration of which 
shall be governed by terms laid down when the loan is 
made. Conditional loans may be made directly, with the 
agreement of the ACP State concerned, to a given firm. 
They may also be granted to an ACP State or to financial 
institutions in the ACP States to enable them to acquire 
a holding in the capital of enterprises operating in the 
sectors referred to in Article 197(5), where such an 
operation comes under the financing of preparatory or 
new productive capital projects and may be supplemented by 
other Community financing, possibly together with other 
sources of financing, as a co-financing operation. Such 
loans may also be granted, case by case, at the request 
of the ACP State, subject to the same conditions and by 
derogation from Article 191, to an enterprise of a 
Community Member State to enable it to undertake a 
productive capital project in the territory of that 
ACP State; 



(c) loans made to financial institutions in the ACP States, 
where the characteristics of their activities and 
management so permit. Such loans may be used for 
onlending to other firms and acquiring holdings In other 
enterprises. 


4. The terms of quasi-capital assistance referred to in 
paragraph 3 shall be determined by reference to the character
istics of each project financed. However, the terms on which 
quasi-capital assistance is granted shall generally be more 
favourable than those for subsidized loans from the Bank. 
The interest rate shall not be greater than that on 
subsidized loans. 



5. Where the assistance referred to in this Article is granted 
to consultancy firms or is used to finance research or invest
ment in preparation for the launching of a project, it may 
be incorporated in any capital assistance to which the 
promoting company may be entitled if the project is carried 
out. 



6. The projects and programmes identified and promoted by 
the joint bodies set up by the Community and the ACP States 
and authorized by those States to attain certain specific 
objectives within the framework of Article 191(1)(c) may also 
be entitled to the quasi-capital assistance referred to in 
paragraph 3 of this Article.


Co-financing</article>
      <article number="ARTICLE 200" article_identifier="23142">1. The financial resources of the Community may be applied, 
at the request of the ACP States, to co-financing, particularly 
where they will facilitate an increase in the financial flows 
to the ACP States and support their efforts to harmonize 
international co-operation for their development. Special 
consideration shall be given to the possibility of co-
financing in the following cases, among others: 



(a) large-scale projects which cannot be financed by any one 
source of financing alone; 



(b) projects in which Community participation, and an input 
of its project expertise, might facilitate the 
participation of other additional sources of finance; 



(c) projects which may benefit from a blend of concessionary 
and non-concessionary financing; 



(d) projects which may be broken down into subprojects which 
could be eligible for financing from different sources; 



(e) projects for which a diversification of financing may lead 
to an advantageous solution from the point of view of 
the financing and investment costs and of other aspects of 
the implementation of the said projects; 



(f) projects of a regional or inter-regional nature. 

2. Cofinancing may be in the form of joint or parallel 
financing. 


Preference shall be given to the more suitable solution from 
the point of view of cost-effectiveness. 


3. Whenever possible, the Commission and the Bank shall try 
to involve private sector resources in projects financed by 
them, and in particular: 



(a) to seek out and negotiate with commercial partners for 
joint financial operations; 



(b) to apply the various techniques developed in recent years 
to attract private-sector resources into cofinancing 
operations. 

4. With the agreement of the parties concerned, necessary 
measures shall be taken to co-ordinate and harmonize 
operations of the Community and of the other cofinancing 
bodies, in order to avoid an increase in the number of 
procedures to be undertaken by the ACP States and to allow 
those procedures to be made more flexible, notably as regards: 



(a) the needs of other cofinancing bodies and recipients; 



(b) the choice of projects to be cofinanced and the 
arrangements for carrying them out; 



(c) the harmonization of works, supply and services contrac' 
rules and procedures; 



(d) the payment terms; 



(e) the rules of eligibility and competition; 



(f) the margin of preference granted to ACP enterprises. 

5. With the agreement of the ACP State concerned, the 
Community may provide the other cofinancing bodies with 
administrative help, should they so desire, in order to 
facilitate the implementation of projects or programmes being 


cofinanced. 


6. At the request of the ACP State in question and with the 
agreement of the other parties concerned, the Commission or 
the Bank may act as a lead or co-ordinating agency for projects 
part-financed by them.


Microprojects</article>
      <article number="ARTICLE 201" article_identifier="23143">1. In order to make a practical response to the needs of 
local communities with regard to development, the Fund shall 
participate in the financing of microprojects at the ACP 
States' request. 



2. Programmes for microprojects shall cover small projects 
within the framework of Article 187 and other projects which 
meet the criteria referred to in paragraph 3 and have an 
economic and social impact on the life of the people and the 
local communities in the ACP States. These projects shall 
normally be located in rural areas. However, the Community 
may also assist in the financing of microprojects in urban 
areas. 



3. In order to be eligible for Community financing, micro-
projects must: 


- meet a priority need demonstrated and observed at local 
level ; 



- be undertaken with the active participation of the local 
community. 

4. Special priority shall be accorded to the preparation and 
implementation of microprojects in the least-developed
