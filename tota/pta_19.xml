(b) 	If a Party takes a decision to impose an anti-dumping duty pursuant to Article 9.1 of the WTO Agreement on Anti-Dumping, the Party taking such a decision shall apply the “lesser duty” rule by imposing a duty which is less than the dumping margin where such lesser duty would be adequate to remove the injury to the domestic industry. 
2. Five years after the entry into force of this Agreement, the Parties shall in the Joint Committee review whether there is need to maintain the possibility to take anti-dumping measures between them.

      <article number="ARTICLE 2.11" name="Bilateral Safeguard Measures" article_identifier="2132">1. Where, as a result of the reduction or elimination of a customs duty under this Agreement, any product originating in a Party is being imported into the territory of another Party in such increased quantities, in absolute terms or relative to domestic production, and under such conditions as to constitute a substantial cause of serious injury or threat thereof to the domestic industry of like or directly competitive products in the territory of the importing Party, the importing Party may take emergency measures to the minimum extent necessary to remedy or prevent the injury, subject to the provisions of the following paragraphs of this Article. 


2. Emergency measures shall only be taken upon clear evidence that increased imports have caused or are threatening to cause serious injury pursuant to an investigation in accordance with the procedures laid down in the WTO Agreement on Safeguards. 


3. The Party intending to take an emergency action under this Article shall immediately, and in any case before taking a measure, make notification to the other Parties and the Joint Committee. The notification shall contain all pertinent information, which shall include evidence of serious injury or threat thereof caused by increased imports, precise description of the product involved, and the proposed measure, proposed date of introduction, expected duration and timetable for the progressive removal of the measure. A Party that may be affected by the measure shall be offered compensation in the form of substantially equivalent trade liberalization in relation to the imports from any such Party. 


4. 	If the conditions in paragraph 1 are met, the importing Party may: 


(a) 	suspend the further reduction of any rate of customs duty provided for under this Agreement for the product; or 


(b) 	increase the rate of customs duty for the product to a level not to exceed the lesser of: 


(i) 	the MFN rate of duty applied at the time the action is taken; or 


(ii) 	the MFN rate of duty applied on the day immediately preceding the date of the entry into force of this Agreement. 

5. Emergency measures shall be taken for a period not exceeding one year. In very exceptional circumstances, after review by the Joint Committee, measures may be taken up to a total maximum period of three years. No measures shall be applied to the import of a product, which has previously been subject to such a measure, for a period of, at least, three years since the expiry of the measure. 


6. The Joint Committee shall, within 30 days from the date of notification, examine the information provided under paragraph 3 in order to facilitate a mutually acceptable resolution of the matter. In the absence of such resolution, the importing Party may adopt a measure pursuant to paragraph 4 to remedy the problem, and, in the absence of mutually agreed compensation, the Party against whose product the measure is taken may take compensatory action. The safeguard measure and the compensatory action shall be immediately notified to the other Parties and the Joint Committee. In the selection of the safeguard measure and the compensatory action, priority must be given to the action which least disturbs the functioning of this Agreement. The compensatory action shall normally consist of suspension of concessions having substantially equivalent trade effects or concessions substantially equivalent to the value of the additional duties expected to result from the emergency action. The Party taking such action shall apply the action only for the minimum period necessary to achieve the substantially equivalent trade effects and in any event, only while the measure under paragraph 4 is being applied. 


7. Upon the termination of the measure, the rate of customs duty shall be the rate which would have been in effect but for the measure. 


8. In critical circumstances, where delay would cause damage which would be difficult to repair, a Party may take a provisional emergency measure pursuant to a preliminary determination that there is clear evidence that increased imports constitute a substantial cause of serious injury, or threat thereof, to the domestic industry. The Party intending to take such a measure shall immediately notify the other Parties and the Joint Committee thereof. Within 30 days of the date of the notification, the pertinent procedures set out in paragraphs 2 to 6, including for compensatory action, 

shall be initiated. Any compensation shall be based on the total period of application of the provisional emergency measure and of the emergency measure.  

9. Any provisional measures shall be terminated within 200 days at the latest. The period of application of any such provisional measure shall be counted as part of the duration of the measure set out in paragraph 4 and any extension thereof. Any tariff increases shall be promptly refunded if the investigation described in paragraph 2 does not result in a finding that the conditions of paragraph 1 are met. 


10. Five years after the date of entry into force of this Agreement, the Parties shall in the Joint Committee review whether there is need to maintain the possibility to take safeguard measures between them. If the Parties decide, after the first review to maintain the possibility, they shall thereafter conduct biennial review of this matter in the Joint Committee.</article>
      <article number="ARTICLE 2.12" name="Balance-Of-Payments Difficulties" article_identifier="2133">1. The Parties shall endeavour to avoid the imposition of restrictive measures for balance-of-payments purposes. 


2. A Party in serious balance-of-payments difficulties, or under imminent threat thereof, may, in accordance with the conditions established under the GATT 1994 and the WTO Understanding on the Balance-of-Payments Provisions, adopt trade restrictive measures, which shall be of limited duration and non-discriminatory, and may not go beyond what is necessary to remedy the balance-of-payments situation. The relevant provisions of the GATT 1994 and the WTO Understanding on the Balance-of-Payments Provisions are hereby incorporated into and made part of this Agreement. 


3. The Party introducing a measure under this Article shall promptly notify the other Parties and the Joint Committee thereof.</article>

(a) 	the means to resolve the dispute, which normally shall conform with the determinations or recommendations, if any, of the arbitration panel; and 


(b) 	the reasonable period of time which may be necessary in order to implement the means to resolve the dispute.

4.

The ruling of the arbitration panel shall be given within 45 days from that request. Benefits shall not be suspended until the arbitration panel has issued its ruling. 


7.

At the request of a Party to the dispute, the original arbitration panel shall rule on the conformity with the final report of any implementing measures adopted after the suspension of benefits and, in light of such ruling, whether the suspension of benefits should be terminated or modified. The ruling of the arbitration panel shall be given within 30 days from the date of that request.
