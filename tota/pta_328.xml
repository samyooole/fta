Any action taken pursuant to Article XIX of GATT 1994 and the Agreement on Safeguards or Article 5 of the Agreement on Agriculture shall not be subject to the Agreement on Dispute Settlement Mechanism under the Framework Agreement (ASEAN-India DSM Agreement). 

2. A Party shall have the right to initiate a safeguard measure under this Article (an AIFTA safeguard measure) on a good within the transition period for that good. The transition period for a good shall begin from the date of entry into force of this Agreement and end five (5) years from the date of completion of tariff reduction/elimination for that good. 


3. A Party shall be free to take an AIFTA safeguard measure if, as an effect of the obligations incurred by that Party under this Agreement, a good is being imported from the other Parties to which tariff concession was made for that good in such increased quantities, absolute or relative to domestic production, and under such conditions so as to substantially cause or threaten to cause serious injury to the domestic industry of the importing Party that produces like or directly competitive goods in its territory. 


4. If an AIFTA safeguard measure is taken, a Party taking such a measure may: 


(a) 	suspend the further reduction of any tariff rate under this Agreement for the good; or 


(b) 	increase the tariff rate on the good concerned to a level not to exceed the lesser of: 


(i) 	the applied MFN tariff rate on the good in effect at the time the action is taken; or 


(ii) 	the applied MFN tariff rate on the good in effect on the day immediately preceding the date of entry into force of this Agreement. 

5. An AIFTA safeguard measure may be maintained for an initial period of up to three (3) years and may be extended for a period not exceeding one (1) year if it is determined pursuant to the procedures referred to in paragraph 6 that the measure continues to be necessary to prevent or remedy serious injury and to facilitate adjustment and that there is evidence that the domestic industry is adjusting. Notwithstanding the duration of an AIFTA safeguard measure on the good, such a measure shall terminate at the end of the transition period for that good. 


6. In applying an AIFTA safeguard measure, the Parties shall adopt and apply, mutatis mutandis, the rules for the application of safeguard measures, including provisional measures, as provided under the Agreement on Safeguards, with the exception of the quantitative restriction measures set out in Articles 5 and 7, and also, Articles 9, 13, and 14 of the Agreement on Safeguards.

8. In seeking compensation under Article 8 of the Agreement on Safeguards for an AIFTA safeguard measure, the Parties concerned shall seek the good offices of the Joint Committee established under Article 17 to determine the substantially equivalent level of concessions to that existing under this Agreement between the Party taking the safeguard measure and the exporting Parties which would be affected by such a measure prior to any suspension of equivalent concessions. Any proceedings arising from such 

good offices shall be completed within 90 days from the date on which the AIFTA safeguard measure was applied. 

9. If no agreement on the compensation is reached within the timeframe specified in paragraph 8, the Parties concerned shall be free to suspend the application of tariff concessions under this Agreement, which is substantially equivalent to the AIFTA safeguard measure on originating goods of the Party applying the AIFTA safeguard measure. 


10. On a Party’s termination of an AIFTA safeguard measure on a good, the tariff rate for that good shall be the rate that, according to that Party’s schedule of tariff reduction and elimination as set out in Annex 1 would have been in effect had the measure not been applied. 


11. Notwithstanding the provisions of this Article, no Party may impose an AIFTA safeguard measure on a good to which actions are being applied pursuant to Article XIX of GATT 1994 and the Agreement on Safeguards or Article 5 of the Agreement on Agriculture. When a Party intends to apply, pursuant to Article XIX of GATT 1994 and the Agreement on Safeguards or Article 5 of the Agreement on Agriculture, an action on a good to which an AIFTA safeguard measure is being applied, it shall terminate the AIFTA safeguard measure prior to the imposition of the action to be applied pursuant to Article XIX of GATT 1994 and the Agreement on Safeguards or Article 5 of the Agreement on Agriculture.
