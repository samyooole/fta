If as a result of the reduction or elimination of a customs duty1 under this Agreement, an originating good of a Party (“the first Party”) is being imported into the territory of the other Party (“the second Party”) in such increased quantities, in absolute terms, or relative to domestic production, and under such conditions that the imports of such good from the first Party alone constitute a substantial cause of serious injury to the domestic industry of the second Party producing a like or directly competitive good, the second Party may, in accordance with this Article: 
(a) suspend the further reduction of any rate of duty provided for under this Agreement for such good; or 


(b) increase the rate of duty on such good to a level not to exceed the lesser of  
(i) the most-favoured nation (hereafter, “MFN”) applied rate of duty in effect at the time the measure is taken; and 
the MFN applied rate of duty in effect on the day immediately proceeding the date of entry into force of this Agreement; or 

(c) in the case of a duty applied to a good on a seasonal basis, increase the rate of duty to a level not to exceed the lesser of the MFN applied rate of duty that was in effect on the good for the immediately preceding corresponding season or the date of entry into force of this Agreement. 
Conditions and Limitations on the Imposition of Bilateral Safeguard Measures 2. The following conditions and limitations shall apply to an investigation or a bilateral safeguard measure under this Article:  1 A determination that an originating good is being imported as a result of the reduction or elimination of a duty provided for in this Agreement shall be made only if such reduction or elimination is a cause which contributes significantly to the increase in imports, but need not be equal to or greater than any other cause. The passage of a period of time between the commencement and termination of such reduction or elimination and the increase in imports shall not by itself preclude the determination referred in this footnote.  If the increase in imports is demonstrably unrelated to such reduction or elimination, the determination referred in this footnote shall not be made.  (a) A Party shall immediately deliver written notice to the other Party upon: (i) initiating an investigation described in Article 2.7.2(d) relating to serious injury; such notice shall state the reasons for initiating such investigation; (ii) making a finding of serious injury caused by increased imports pursuant to the investigation described in Article 2.7.2(d); and (iii) taking a decision to apply a safeguard measure under this Article; (b) In making the notification referred to in Article 2.7.2(a), the Party proposing to apply a safeguard measure shall provide the other Party with all pertinent information, which shall include where available, evidence of serious injury caused by the increased imports, a precise description of the good involved and the proposed measure, the proposed date of introduction and the expected duration of the measure.  The Party proposing to apply a measure is also obliged to provide, subject to Article 8.3, any additional information which the other Party considers necessary; (c) A Party proposing to apply a measure shall provide adequate opportunity for prior consultations with the other Party as far in advance of taking any such measure as practicable, with a view to reviewing the information arising from the investigation conducted pursuant to Article 2.7.2(d), exchanging views on the measure and reaching an agreement on compensation under Article 2.7.4.  The Parties shall in such consultations, review, inter alia, the information provided under Article 2.7.2(b) to examine: (i) compliance with this Article; (ii) whether any proposed measure should be taken; and (iii) whether any proposed measure would operate such as to constitute an unnecessary obstacle to trade between the Parties; (d) A Party shall apply or take the measure only following an investigation by the competent authorities of that Party in accordance with Articles 3 and 4.2(c) of the WTO Agreement on Safeguards; and to this end, Articles 3 and 4.2(c) of the WTO Agreement on Safeguards are incorporated, mutatis mutandis, into and made a part of this Agreement; (e) In undertaking the investigation described in Article 2.7.2.(d), a Party shall comply with the requirements of Articles 4.2(a) and (b) of the WTO Agreement on Safeguards; and to this end, Articles 4.2(a) and (b) are incorporated, mutatis mutandis, into and made a part of this Agreement; (f) The investigation shall be promptly terminated and no measure shall be taken if imports of the good under investigation represent less than 5 per cent of apparent domestic consumption or less than 10 per cent of total imports2; (g) The investigation shall in all cases be completed within one year following its date of initiation;  
(h) No measure shall be maintained: 
(i) except to the extent and for such time as may be necessary to remedy serious injury and to facilitate adjustment; (ii) for a period exceeding one year, except that in exceptional circumstances, the period may be extended by up to an additional two years, to a total maximum of three years from the date that the measure was first imposed, if the competent authorities of the Party applying such measure determine in conformity with procedures that are set out in Articles 2.7.2(a)-(g), that the safeguard measure continues to be necessary to prevent or remedy serious injury and to facilitate adjustment and that there is evidence that the industry is adjusting; or 
beyond the expiration of the transition period;  
(i)      No investigation or bilateral safeguard measure shall be applied to the import of a particular good which has been previously subject to any other safeguard investigation under this Article; and (j) Upon the termination of the safeguard measure, the rate of duty shall be the rate which would have been in effect if such measure was not applied. 2 For the purposes of Article 2.7.2(f), the time frame to be used for calculating the applicable percentages shall be the 12 month period prior to the filing of an application to the Party requesting for the imposition of a safeguard measure.    Provisional Measures 3. In critical circumstances where delay would cause damage which would be difficult to repair, a Party may take a measure described in Article 2.7.1(a), (b) or (c) on a provisional basis pursuant to a preliminary determination that there is clear evidence that imports from the other Party have increased as a result of the reduction or elimination of a customs duty under this Agreement, and such imports constitute a substantial cause of serious injury, or threat thereof, to the domestic industry.  The duration of such provisional measure shall not exceed 200 days, during which time the requirements of Articles 2.7.2(d) and 2.7.2(e) shall be met.  Any increase in tariffs as a result of such provisional measure shall be promptly refunded if the investigation described in Article 2.7.2(d) does not result in a finding that the requirements of Article 2.7.1 are met.  The duration of any provisional measure shall be counted as part of the period described in Article 2.7.2(g). Compensation 4. The Party proposing to apply a measure described in Article 2.7.1 shall provide to the other Party mutually agreed adequate means of trade liberalizing compensation in the form of concessions having substantially equivalent trade effects or equivalent to the value of the additional duties expected to result from the measure. If the Parties are unable to agree on compensation within 30 days in the consultations under Article 2.7.2(c), the Party against whose originating good the measure is applied may take action having trade effects substantially equivalent to the measure applied under this Article. This action shall be applied only for the minimum period necessary to achieve the substantially equivalent trade effects. However, the right to take compensatory action shall not be exercised for the first 24 months from the date that the measure was applied, provided that the measure has been applied as a result of an absolute increase in imports and that the measure is in accordance with this Article. Administration of Safeguard Investigation Proceedings 5.  Each Party shall: (a)  ensure the consistent, impartial and reasonable administration of its laws, regulations, decisions and rulings governing all investigations described in Article 2.7.2(d);  (b) entrust determinations of serious injury in safeguard investigation proceedings to a competent investigating authority, subject to review by judicial or administrative tribunals, to the extent provided by domestic law. Negative injury determinations shall not be subject to modification, except by such review.  The competent investigating authority empowered under domestic law to conduct such proceedings should be provided with the necessary resources to enable it to fulfil its duties; and  (c) adopt or maintain fair, timely, transparent and effective procedures for investigations described in Article 2.7.2(d). Global Safeguard Measures 6. Each Party retains its rights and obligations under Article XIX of the GATT 1994 and the WTO Agreement on Safeguards.  This Agreement does not confer any additional rights or obligations on the Parties with regard to actions taken pursuant to Article XIX of the GATT 1994 and the WTO Agreement on Safeguards, except that a Party taking a safeguard measure under Article XIX of the GATT 1994 and the WTO Agreement on Safeguards may exclude imports of an originating good from the other Party if such imports are not a substantial cause of serious injury or threat thereof. Prohibition of Safeguard Investigations 7. No safeguard investigation described in Article 2.7.2(d) shall be initiated against a good, if the good is the subject matter of an anti-dumping measure.</article>
      <article number="ARTICLE 2.8" name="Anti-Dumping Measures" article_identifier="2374">1. Except as otherwise provided in this Article, each Party retains its rights and obligations under the WTO Agreement on the Implementation of Article VI of the GATT 1994 (WTO Anti-Dumping Agreement). For the purposes of this Agreement, both Parties agree to the following changes in terms of implementation of the WTO Anti-Dumping Agreement, in order to bring greater discipline to anti-dumping investigations and to minimise the opportunities to use anti-dumping in an arbitrary or protectionist manner: 


(a) the de minimis margin of 2 per cent, expressed as a percentage of the export price below which there shall be immediate termination of an investigation as provided for in Article 5.8 of the WTO Anti-Dumping Agreement, is raised to 5 per cent; 


(b) the volume of dumped imports normally regarded as negligible under Article 5.8 of the WTO Anti-Dumping Agreement is raised from 3 per cent to 5 per cent of imports of the like good in the importing Party, below which there shall be an immediate termination of an investigation; 


(c) Articles 2.8.1(a) and (b) shall apply to investigations and review cases initiated after the entry into force of this Agreement; 


(d) Article 14 of the WTO Anti-Dumping Agreement on third country dumping shall not be applied by the Parties; 


(e) the time frame to be used for determining material injury, calculation of the volume of dumped imports in an investigation or review shall be representative of the imports of both dumped and non-dumped goods and shall be for a reasonable period, and such reasonable period shall normally be at least 12 months;  


(f) any anti-dumping duty shall be terminated on a date not later than 3 years from the date that the duty was imposed. In exceptional circumstances, the authorities of the Party applying such measure may initiate such review and consider the continued application of such measure; 


(g) if a decision is taken to impose anti-dumping duty pursuant to Article 9.1 of the WTO Anti-Dumping Agreement, the  Party taking such a decision, shall where possible, apply the ‘lesser duty’ rule, i.e. a duty which is less than the dumping margin where such lesser duty would be adequate to remove the injury to the domestic injury; and 


(h) in the conduct of investigations and reviews, the margin of dumping and the resulting dumping duty based on such margin shall be calculated by  strict price comparison on the basis of transaction to transaction, and weighted average to weighted average, and not weighted-average price and individual price. Where weighted-average prices are used, such prices shall be calculated based on the entire period of investigation, and not any particular period therein. 


2. Immediately following the acceptance of a properly documented application from an industry in a Party for the initiation of an anti-dumping investigation in respect of goods from the other Party, the Party that has accepted the properly documented application shall immediately inform the other Party of the acceptance of the application. Should the recipient Party observe any variation in the volume statistics relating to exports and imports, consultations with a view to reaching a satisfactory solution shall take place upon the recipient Party’s request and such solution shall be reached within 30 days from receipt of such request.  


3. No anti-dumping investigations shall be initiated against a good if that good is subject to a safeguard measure under Article 2.7.</article>

(a) necessary to protect public morals; 


(b) necessary to protect human, animal or plant life or health; 


(c) relating to the importations or exportations of gold or silver;

(i) involving restrictions on exports of domestic materials necessary to ensure essential quantities of such materials to a domestic processing industry during periods when the domestic price of such materials is held below the world price as part of a governmental stabilization plan; provided that such restrictions shall not operate to increase the exports of or the protection afforded to such domestic industry, and shall not depart from the provisions of this Agreement relating to non discrimination; 


(j) essential to the acquisition or distribution of products in general or local short supply; provided that any such measures shall be consistent with the principle that all WTO members are entitled to an equitable share of the international supply of such products, and that any such measures which are inconsistent with the other provisions of this Agreement shall be discontinued as soon as the conditions giving rise to them have ceased to exist.</article>
