Recalling the Australian-New Zealand Agreement 1944 in which they agreed to

Desirous of strengthening economic relations between their two countries, and 
Recognizing the obligations assumed by them under the General Agreement on 


Tariffs and Trade, 
Have agreed as follows:</article>
    </chapter>
    <chapter chapter_identifier="1941">
      <article number="ARTICLE 1" article_identifier="16407">Free 	Trade Area 



1. A Free Trade Area (in this Agreement called "the Area") is hereby 
established. 



2. The Area consists of New Zealand and Australia, which countries or, as the 
context requires, the Governments thereof, are in this Agreement called the 
"Member States". 



3. In paragraph 2 of this Article "New Zealand" means the metropolitan territory 
of New Zealand and excludes the Cook Islands, Niue and the Tokelau Islands, and 
"Australia" means the territory of the States and of the mainland Territories of 
the Commonwealth of Australia. 



4. The word "territory" in this Agreement, when used in relation to either 
Member State, shall have a meaning corresponding to the appropriate definition 
of "New Zealand" or "Australia" in paragraph 3 of this Article.</article>
      <article number="ARTICLE 2" name="Objectives" article_identifier="16408">The objectives of the Member States in concluding this Agreement are: 



(a) 	to further the development of the Area and the use of the resources of 
the Area by promoting a sustained and mutually beneficial expansion of 
trade; 



(b) 	to ensure as far as possible that trade within the Area takes place under 
conditions of fair competition; and 



(c) 	to contribute to the harmonious development and expansion of world trade 
and to the progressive removal of barriers thereto.</article>
      <article number="ARTICLE 3" name="Scope Of This Agreement" article_identifier="16409">1. The provisions of Articles 4, 6, 7, 8 and 9 and, except as otherwise therein 
provided, the provisions of Article 5, shall apply only in respect of goods listed 
in Schedule A to this Agreement (in this Agreement called "scheduled goods"). 



2. Subject to the provisions of paragraph 1 of this Article, this Agreement applies 
to all goods traded within the Area. The provisions of the Trade Agreement of the 
5th September, 1933, between Australia and New Zealand, with amendments, shall be 

read subject to this Agreement but, except as thus superseded or modified, shall 
continue in force, be deemed to form part of, and have the same duration as this 
Agreement. 


3. The Member States shall from time to time jointly review the trade of both 
Member States in goods not listed in Schedule A to this Agreement with a view to 
the inclusion of additional items in that Schedule. Such reviews shall take into 
account all trade between the Member States and the effect which the addition of 


any item or items to Schedule A to this Agreement would have on the economies of 
both Member States. The objective of these reviews shall be the progressive 
listing in Schedule A to this Agreement of all goods which enter or might enter 
into the trade of either Member State, except those goods the inclusion of which 
would be seriously detrimental to an industry in the territory of either Member 
State, or would be contrary to the national interest of either Member State, or 
would be inconsistent with the objectives of any commodity arrangement to which 
both Member States are parties. 


4. The first of the reviews provided for in paragraph 3 of this Article shall 


take place not later than two years after the entry into force of this Agreement. 
Thereafter such reviews shall take place annually. 


5. In deciding whether the addition of any item or items to Schedule A to this 
Agreement would be seriously detrimental to an industry in its territory, each 
Member State shall consider whether such addition would cause or threaten to cause 
material injury to its producers of like or directly competitive goods or would 


or might hinder the establishment of an industry to produce or manufacture like or 
directly competitive goods. In particular, each Member State shall have regard to 


the effect which the addition of any item or items to Schedule A to this Agreement 
would have on profit levels, employment, capital investment and prices. 


6. In deciding whether the addition of any item or items to Schedule A to this 
Agreement would be contrary to its national interest, a Member State may take into 


account the effect that such addition would have on its trade with other countries. 


7. In relation to goods not at the time listed in Schedule A to this Agreement, 
the Member States may agree on and implement special measures beneficial to the 
trade and development of each Member State and designed to further the objectives 
of this Agreement. Such measures may include the remission or reduction of duties 
on agreed goods or classes of goods in part or in whole.</article>
      <article number="ARTICLE 4" name="Import Duties" article_identifier="16410">1. Subject to the provisions of Articles 6, 7, 8 and 9 of this Agreement, each 
Member State shall reduce and eliminate, in accordance with the provisions of this 
Article, import duties on scheduled goods imported from the territory of the other 


Member State. 



2. If, on the day immediately preceding the day on which this Article first 
applies to them, scheduled goods are: 



(a) 	free of import duties -they shall remain free of import duties; 



(b) 	subject to import duties not exceeding 5 per cent ad valorem or import 
duties of equivalent effect -they shall be and remain free of import 
duties from the day on which this Article first applies to them; 



(c) 	subject to import duties of more than 5 per cent but not exceeding 
10 per cent ad valorem or import duties of equivalent effect: 



(i) 	they shall, from the day on which this Article first applies to them, 
be subject to import duties not exceeding 50 per cent of those payable 
on the day immediately preceding the day on which this Article first 
applies to them, and 



(ii) 	they shall, from the day two years after the day on which this 
Article first applies to them, be and remain free of import duties; 


(d) 	subject to import duties of more than 10 per cent ad valorem or import 
duties of equivalent effect -they shall, from each of the days listed 
hereunder, not be subject to import duties exceeding the percentage specified against that day of the import duties payable on the day immediately 
preceding the day on which this Article first applies to them: 

-the day on which this Article first applies to them 

80 per cent 
-the day two years after the day on which this Article first applies to them

temporary duties. 


3. For the purposes of paragraph 2 of this Article, the term "import duties of 
equivalent effect" shall mean duties, other than variable duties, which are not 
expressed solely in ad valorem terms. Where scheduled goods are subject to such 
duties, for the purpose of determining which of the sub-paragraphs (b), (c) or (d)
of paragraph 2 of this Article shall apply to those goods, those duties shall be 



deemed to be equivalent to the ad valorem rates obtained by expressing the total 
amount of duties which a Member State has collected, in the most recent year ending 
on the thirtieth day of June for which official statistics are available, on 
imports from the territory of the other Member State of those goods entered at 
substantive rates of duty, as a percentage of the sum of the values for duty of 
those imports. If in that year there have been no imports of those goods from the 
territory of the other Member State, or if in the opinion of either Member State 
the volume of imports of those goods was insufficient to represent the usual and 
ordinary course of trade between the Member States in those goods, the Member 
States shall consult for the purpose of determining the manner in which the provisions of paragraph 2 of this Article shall be applied to those goods. 



4. The Member States shall consult for the purpose of determining the manner in 
which the provisions of paragraph 2 of this Article shall be applied to goods subject to variable duties. 



5. A Member State shall not levy temporary duties on scheduled goods. Any 
temporary duties applicable to scheduled goods on the day immediately preceding the 
day on which this Article first applies to them shall be eliminated as from the 
latter day. 



6. A Member State may reduce more rapidly or eliminate earlier than is provided 
in paragraph 2 of this Article any of the import duties referred to in that paragraph 



7. The Member States may agree that import duties on any scheduled goods shall be 
reduced or eliminated over a longer period than is provided in paragraph 2 of 
this Article.</article>

restrictions on trade within the Area unless, consistently with their international 
obligations, they are applying such restrictions to trade with third countries, or 
such restrictions form part of any commodity arrangement to which both Member 
States are parties. 



2. Having regard to the objective of ensuring as far as possible that trade 
within the Area takes place under conditions of fair competition, a Member State 
which is maintaining quantitative import restrictions on imports of scheduled 
goods from the territory of the other Member State shall reduce and eliminate those 
restrictions at the earliest practicable date, taking into account its balance of 
payments and the desirability of avoiding any undue diversion of trade. 



3. Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph 2 of this Article, a Member State 
may, after consultation with the other Member State, reimpose quantitative import 
restrictions or introduce new quantitative import restrictions on trade in 

scheduled goods where, in the absence of such action, the effectiveness of the 
application of quantitative import restrictions, which, for balance-of-payments 
reasons, consistently with its international obligations, it is applying on 
imports from outside the Area, would be, or be likely to be, seriously prejudiced. 



4. At the request of either Member State, consultations shall be held regarding 
the application and effect of the restrictions referred to in paragraphs 2 and 3 
of this Article. In the event that such restrictions are interfering unduly, or 
seem likely to interfere unduly, with conditions of fair competition within the 
Area, the Member States shall in those consultations consider appropriate measures 
to remedy the situation. 



5. A Member State which is maintaining quantitative import restrictions on imports 
from the territory of the other Member State shall ensure, to the extent permitted 
by its balance of payments, that the administration of such restrictions is in 
conformity with the objective of the gradual elimination of barriers to trade 
between the Member States.</article>

2. If, on the day immediately preceding the day on which this Article first 
applies to them, revenue duties or taxes are being levied by a Member State on any 
scheduled goods imported from the territory of the other Member State, or on 
ingredients or components contained in those goods, and the rate of such duties 

or taxes is higher than the rate ofinternal roveue duties or taxes which would 
be levied on those goods, ingredients or components had they been produced in the 
territory of the first Member State, that portion of the revenue duties or taxes 
which exceeds the internal duties or taxes shall be treated as an import duty and
