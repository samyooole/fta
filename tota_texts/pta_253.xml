Information Furnished by the Parties to the Agreement</article>
    </chapter>
    <chapter chapter_identifier="2429">
      <article article_identifier="20310">1.	 This report covers the period from 1 May 1980 to 31 December 1982. 



2. The Agreement between the EFTA countries and Spain - including the 
bilateral agreements concluded in accordance with Article 9 concerning 
trade in agricultural products - which entered into force on 1 May 1980, 
has been applied in accordance with its provisions. 



3. The objective of the Agreement is to reduce progressively and to 
eliminate the obstacles to substantially all the trade between the EFTA 
countries and Spain in accordance with the provisions of the GATT 
concerning the establishment of free-trade areas. 



4.	 The main results of the Agreement are as follows: 



(a)	 The first tariff reductions under the Agreement were made on 
1 July 1980. As a result, the level of liberalization achieved 
so far by virtue of the Agreement generally corresponds to the 
level of liberalization under the 1970 Agreement between Spain 
and'the EEC. In accordance with Annex I of the EFTA-Spain 
Agreement the EFTA countries, except for Portugal for which 
country there are special provisions (Annex P to the Agreement), 
have reduced their duties on almost all industrial products 
imported from Spain by 60 per cent. Spain has reduced its duties 
by 60 per cent on the imports of the products in List A of 
Annex II to the Agreement and by 25 per cent on products in 
Lists B and C. Furthermore, there have been sizeable tariff 
reductions on certain processed agricultural goods and on some 
food products. 



(b)	 In accordance with Annex V to the Agreement, Spain has increased 
the import quotas by at least 10 per cent annually. 



(c)	 In accordance with the special provisions concerning trade 
between Portugal and Spain set out in Annex P to the Agreement, 
Portugal has progressively reduced tariffs on imports of 
products originating in Spain. Total reductions range from 

20 per cent to 60 per cent. Spanish reductions vis-à-vis 
Portugal amount to from 10 to 75 per cent. The products for 
which these tariff reductions have been made, together with the 
time schedule followed, are contained in lists included in the 
Agreement. 


The rules of origin in Annex III to the Agreement which 
determine the eligibility of products for the tariff reduction 
under the Agreement have been applied as foreseen. In 
accordance with the provisions of this Annex the rules have, 
in specific cases, been amended and supplemented in order to 
facilitate their implementation and application. 


The Joint Committee established to administer the Agreement 
and to supervise its implementation has met five times. During 
these meetings two annual reviews of the Agreement have been 
made and the Decisions taken are listed at Annex. 


In 1982 the Joint Committee undertook the comprehensive 
examination foreseen in paragraph 2 of Article 3 of the 
Agreement, with a view to finding additional ways and means to 
achieve substantial progress in the further elimination of 
obstacles to trade. It was noted that for products on which 
tariff reductions have been agreed upon in the MTN, the EFTA 
countries applied the resulting lower rates as the basic duties 
for tariff reductions under the Agreement. Consequently, the 
real tariff reductions had been greater than denoted by the 
relevant provisions of the Agreement. As concerns the tariff 
reductions undertaken by Spain, the basic duties were the rate 
of duty actually applied to third States by Spain at any given 
time, e.g. either the autonomous rate of the Spanish customs 
tariff or, if lower, the rate prescribed by the rules of the 
GATT. Furthermore, it was recognized that the negotiations 
on the accession of Spain to the European Communities were at 
an advanced stage and, as the Free Trade Agreements between 
the EFTA countries and the Communities will become applicable 
also to trade with Spain, these negotiations had to be seen 
as constituting a step towards achieving the objective of the 
Agreement. 


Commercial incidence: approximately 81 per cent of the imports 
of the EFTA countries from Spain are covered by the Agreement. 
On exports from the EFTA countries to Spain the figure is 
approximately 97 per cent.
