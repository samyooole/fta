of Great Britain and Northern Ireland hereby become Parties 
to the Association Agreement between the European Economic 
Community and Turkey arnd also to the Declarations annexed to 
the Final Act signed. at Ankara on 12 September 1963 and to the 
Final Act si.ged at Brussels on 23 November 1970.</article>
    </chapter>
    <chapter number="TITLE I" name="Adaptation Measures" chapter_identifier="2397">
      <article number="ARTICLE 2" article_identifier="19916">The texts of the Association Agreement, including the 
Protoco2.s which form an integral part thereof and also the 
Declarations referred to in Article 1, drawn up in the English 
and Danish languages and annexed to this Protocol, are 
authentic in the same way as the original texts.</article>
      <article number="ARTICLE 3" article_identifier="19917">Article 12 of the Additional Protocol shall, from 
paragraph 4 onwards, be amended as follows: 



"14. The Association Council may also, during the 
transition period decide that the right available 
to Turkey under paragraph 3 may entitle it to introduce quotas, instead of reintroducing, increasing 
or imposing customs duties, provided that such quota 
is not lower than 60% of the imports from the 
Community of the product in question during the 
preceding year. The value of imports from the 
Community in 1967 of the products affected by these 
quota measures must be counted against the total 
value or the imports referred to in the first 
subparagraph of paragraph 3. 


The Association Council shall lay down the 
conditions governing the application and termination 
of these measures. 


5. 	Notwithstanding paragraph 4 and for the period 
during which Turkey applies the degree of consolidated liberalization fixed at 40% in accordance 
with Article 22 (2) and (3), the following rules 
shall be applicable: 


Ifr the Association Council has not taken a 
decision under paragraph 4, within six months of a 
request being made, Turkey may, after informing the 
Association Council and not earlier than cone year 
after making its request, introduce quotas on the 
terms indicated in paragraph 4. 


All such quotas shall not affect more than 5% of 
the total value of imports in 1967 from the Community 
as originally constituted. The value of imports in 
1967 which are affected by quota measures shall be 
calculated on the basis of imports from the Community 
as originally constituted and shall be charged 
against the value referred to in the first subparagraph of paragraph 3. If, however, these quotas 
affect products added to the list when the degree of 
consolidated liberalization was raised in accordance 
with Article 22 (4), the value of imports shall be 
calculated on the basis of imports in 1967 from the 
original Member States and the new Member States. 


Turkey shall, at the same time, add new 
products to the list of liberalized products 
consolidated in accordance with Article 22 (4) in 
order to ensure that the value of imports from the 
Community of all the products listed does not fall. 


Consultations may be held within the Association 
Council on the progressive elimination of restrictive 
measures introduced by Turkey pursuant to this 
paragraph. 


6. 	Tlhe Association Council may derogate from 
paragraphs 1, 3,94 and 5."</article>
      <article number="ARTICLE 4" article_identifier="19918">1. 	For the purposes of Article 12, Article 22 (2) and (5) 
and Article 25 of the Additional Protocol, the level of 
imports to be taken into consideration from the Community 
shall, when being calculated, include, among imports from 
the Community in its original composition, Turkish imports 
from the new Member States during the period under 
consideration. 


However, for the purposes of Article 22 (2) of the 
Additional Protocol, this rule shall apply only to 
increases in the degree of consolidated liberalization to 
be effected by Turkey after 1 January 1976. 


2. 	On the entry into force of this Protocol, Turkey may 
make amendments to the list of liberalised products which 
it has supplied in accordance with Article 22 (4) of the 
Additional Protocol, provided that: 


-these amendments do not affect more than 10% of the 
value of imports from the Community in 1967 of products 
contained in the list, 


-the value of imports from the Community of all the 
products contained in the list of liberalized products, 
calculated as before on the basis of the figures for 
1967, does not fall, 


-for products removed from the list of liberalized 
products, quotas are opened which are not less than 60% 
of imports of these products from the Community during 
the preceding year, without prejudice to the right of 
Turkey to apply to these products the provisions of 
Article 22 (5) of the Additional Protocol. 



The value of imports from the Community which are 
affected by these amendments shall be counted against the 
total value of imports referred to in the first subparagraph 
of Article 12 (3) of the Additional Protocol.

measures taken in pursuance of the above provisions.</article>
