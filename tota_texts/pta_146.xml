), as amended, automotive goods originating in Canada that comply with: 


(a) 	the United States Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standards (hereinafter referred to as “FMVSS”) and other standards or regulations listed in Annex 6-A; or 


(b) 	the UN regulations
3 
and other standards or regulations listed in Appendix 2-C-3 Table 1 of the Free Trade Agreement between the Republic of Korea, of the One Part, and the European Union and its Member States, of the Other Part in accordance with the terms of that Agreement, as amended.
4 

If Korea incorporates any additional FMVSS, UN regulations, or other standards or regulations into its domestic law or otherwise accepts any such additional standards or regulations as equivalent to KMVSS, it shall also accept as complying with the corresponding KMVSS automotive goods of Canada that comply with these standards or regulations, as they are incorporated into, including any adaptations, or deemed equivalent to, its domestic law. 

2 KMVSS refers to the corresponding standards of the Automobile Management Act of Korea. 

3 For the purposes of this Article, UN regulations means regulations covered by the 1958 Agreement of the World Forum for Harmonization of Vehicle Regulations (WP.29), within the framework of the United Nations Economic Commission for Europe. 

4 For greater certainty, when Korea accepts compliance with UN regulations in conformity with paragraph 2(b), UN ECE type-approval certificates issued by competent authorities shall be considered as providing a presumption of conformity. If Korea finds that a certain good covered by a type-approval certificate does not conform to the approved type, it shall inform Canada. This footnote is without prejudice to Korea’s right to take appropriate measures, as set out in paragraph 4(b). 

3. Canada shall accept as complying with the corresponding Canadian Motor Vehicle Safety Standards (hereinafter referred to as “CMVSS”
5
), as amended, automotive goods originating in Korea that comply with: 


(a) 	the FMVSS and other standards or regulations listed in Annex 6-B (Table 1), as incorporated into the corresponding CMVSS, including any adaptations provided for in CMVSS; or 


(b) 	the UN regulations listed in Annex 6-B (Table 2), as incorporated into the corresponding CMVSS, including any adaptations provided for in CMVSS. 
If Canada incorporates any additional FMVSS, UN regulations, or other standards or regulations into its domestic law or otherwise accepts any such additional standards or regulations as equivalent to CMVSS, it shall also accept as complying with the corresponding CMVSS automotive goods of Korea that comply with these standards or regulations, as they are incorporated into, including any adaptations, or deemed equivalent to, its domestic law. 

4. Notwithstanding compliance with the standards or regulations referred to in paragraphs 2 and 3, each Party may: 


(a) 	require that automotive goods be certified and marked as complying with its relevant domestic law; 


(b) 	verify by random sampling in accordance with its domestic law that the automotive good, including an automotive good self-certified by a manufacturer, complies as appropriate with: 
(i) an applicable standard or regulation of the Party; or 

CMVSS refers to the correspondingly numbered sections of Schedules IV and V.1 of the Canadian Motor Vehicle Safety Regulations and Motor Vehicle Tire Safety Regulations. 

(ii) 	an applicable standard or regulation, as set out in paragraphs 2 and 3. 

Each Party may require the supplier to withdraw the automotive good from the market in case the good concerned does not comply with the applicable standard or regulation as the case may be; 


(c) 	in exceptional circumstances, require a supplier to withdraw an automotive good from its market if there are urgent and compelling risks for road safety, public health, or the environment based on substantiated scientific or technical information. Such a temporary emergency measure shall not constitute a means of arbitrary or unjustifiable discrimination against the good of the other Party or a disguised restriction on trade. Before it is implemented, any such measure shall be notified to the other Party and to the supplier with an objective, reasoned, and sufficiently detailed explanation of the motivation for the measure; and 


(d) 	modify its domestic law, including by amending or revising any standard or the manner in which or the extent to which a standard is incorporated into, or deemed equivalent to, its domestic law. Each Party shall maintain the incorporation of the standards or regulations covered by paragraphs 2 and 3 into its domestic law or continue to otherwise accept those standards or regulations as equivalent to its domestic law, unless doing so would provide for a lower level of safety than the level of safety that would be achieved by a modification to its domestic law or, for Canada, would compromise North American integration. 

5. If a Party modifies its domestic law pursuant to paragraph 4(d), the Party shall notify the other Party of the modification. Without prejudice to paragraph 4(d), if such modification renders inappropriate the continued incorporation into, or otherwise acceptance as equivalent to, its domestic law of the standards and regulations covered by paragraphs 2 and 3, the Parties may decide to amend accordingly the relevant provisions of this Agreement upon consideration by the Commission. 


6. Each Party shall promptly communicate to the concerned manufacturer or importer a decision taken on compliance testing if the manufacturer or importer is deemed by competent national authorities not to be in compliance with relevant laws or regulations, as well as the basis for any such decision and information on available legal remedies. 


7. The Parties agree to use relevant Global Technical Regulations, or other guides or recommendations issued by international standardising bodies (hereinafter collectively referred to as “guides or recommendations”), or relevant parts of them, if they exist, as a basis for compliance testing procedures on automotive goods, except if such guides or recommendations are inappropriate for the Party concerned for reasons covered by Article 5.4 of the TBT Agreement and duly explained upon request of the other Party
6
. If a Party proposes to apply a compliance testing procedure that is not based on relevant guides or recommendations, it shall publish in advance the procedure it proposes to adopt, and provide interested persons a reasonable opportunity to comment. 
Compliance Testing 

New Technologies 


8. A Party shall not prevent or unduly delay the placing on its market of an automotive good on the ground that the good incorporates a new technology or a new feature which has not yet been regulated unless the Party demonstrates at the request of the other Party, based on scientific or technical information, that this new technology or new feature creates a risk for human health, safety, or the environment. 


9. If a Party decides to refuse the placing on its market or require the withdrawal from its market of an automotive good on the ground that the good incorporates a new technology or a new feature creating a risk for human health, safety, or the environment, the Party shall immediately notify the other Party and the importer of the good of its decision. The notification shall include all relevant scientific or technical information. 
“Relevant” guides or recommendations in this paragraph are guides or recommendations on compliance testing procedures applicable to a standard or regulation that a Party has incorporated into its domestic law, either by reference or by duplicating the relevant provisions of that standard or regulation.

Notification and Consultation 

2. Upon receipt by a Party’s competent authority of a properly documented antidumping or countervailing duty application in respect of imports from the other Party, and before initiating an investigation, that Party shall provide written notification to the other Party of its receipt of the application and afford the other Party a meeting or other similar opportunity regarding the application, consistent with that Party’s domestic law. 

Lesser duty 

3. 	(a) The Parties recognise the desirability of providing for the possibility of imposing antidumping or countervailing duties that are less than the full margin of dumping or amount of subsidy. 

(b) 	In this regard: 


(i) 	Korea shall apply its relevant domestic laws and regulations; and 


(ii) 	Canada shall consider information provided in accordance with its domestic law as to whether imposing an antidumping or countervailing duty would not be in the public interest. After considering this information, the competent authority may consider whether the amount of the antidumping or countervailing duty to be imposed shall be the full margin of dumping or amount of subsidy, or a lesser amount that would be adequate to remove the injury to the domestic industry, in accordance with the domestic law of Canada. 
Although recourse to dispute settlement is not available with respect to paragraphs 2 and 4, the Parties affirm that those paragraphs create binding rights and obligations.

A Party may determine limitations and exceptions with regard to temporary reproductions under that Party’s domestic law. 

10 A Party may satisfy the obligation in this paragraph by implementing such a right in accordance with the WPPT. 

Protection of Technological Measures 


4. Each Party shall provide adequate legal protection and effective legal remedies against the circumvention of effective technological measures
11

6. In implementing paragraphs 4 and 5, a Party is not obligated to require that the design of, or the design and selection of parts and components for, a consumer electronics, telecommunications, or computing product provide for a response to a particular technological measure, so long as the product does not otherwise contravene that Party’s measures implementing these paragraphs. This Agreement does not require a Party to mandate interoperability in that Party’s law, i.e., there is no obligation for the Information Communication Technology industry to design devices, products, components, or services to correspond to certain technological protection measures. 


7. In providing adequate legal protection and effective legal remedies pursuant to paragraph 4, a Party may adopt or maintain appropriate limitations or exceptions to measures implementing paragraphs 4 and 5. The obligations set forth in paragraphs 4 and 5 are without prejudice to the rights, limitations, exceptions, or defences to copyright or related rights infringement under a Party’s domestic law.

(b) 	to distribute, import for distribution, broadcast, communicate, or make available to the public copies of works, performances, or phonograms, knowing that electronic rights management information has been removed or altered without authority. 

9. In providing adequate legal protection and effective legal remedies pursuant to paragraph 8, a Party may adopt or maintain appropriate limitations or exceptions to measures implementing paragraph 8. The obligations set forth in paragraph 8 are without prejudice to the rights, limitations, exceptions, or defences to copyright or related rights infringement under a Party’s law. 

Protection of Encrypted Program-Carrying Satellite Signals 

10. 	Each Party shall make it a criminal or civil offense:

(b) 	to receive, in connection with commercial activities, or further distribute, an encrypted program-carrying satellite signal that has been decoded without the authorisation of the lawful distributor of the signal. 
Each Party shall provide that any civil offense established under subparagraph (a) or (b) is actionable by any person that holds an interest in the content of the signal.</article>
      <article number="ARTICLE 16.12" name="Patents" article_identifier="13099">1. Each Party shall make patents available for any invention, whether a product or process, in all fields of technology, provided that the invention is new, involves an inventive step, and is capable of industrial application
13
. In addition, each Party confirms that patents shall be available for any new uses or methods of using a known product, provided that the invention is new, involves an inventive step, and is capable of industrial application.

Exclusion from Patentability 

2. 	Each Party may exclude from patentability: 


(a) 	inventions, the prevention within that Party’s territory of the commercial exploitation of which is necessary to protect ordre public or morality, including to protect human, animal or plant life or health or to avoid serious prejudice to the environment, provided that such exclusion is not made merely because the exploitation is prohibited by that Party’s domestic law; 


(b) 	diagnostic, therapeutic, and surgical methods for the treatment of humans or animals; and 


(c) 	plants and animals other than micro-organisms, and essentially biological processes for the production of plants or animals other than non-biological and microbiological processes.

These procedures shall be applied in a manner so as to avoid the creation of barriers to legitimate trade and to provide for safeguards against their abuse. 


2. Each Party shall provide that the procedures adopted, maintained, or applied to implement this Chapter are fair and equitable, and provide for the rights of all participants subject to such procedures to be appropriately protected. Each Party shall also provide that these procedures are not unnecessarily complicated or costly, or entail unreasonable time-limits or unwarranted delays. 


3. In implementing this Chapter, each Party shall take into account the need for proportionality between the seriousness of the infringement, the interests of third parties, and the applicable measures, remedies, and penalties. 


4. This Chapter is not to be construed to require a Party to make its officials subject to liability for acts undertaken in the performance of their official duties. 
Presumption of Authorship or Ownership 

5. In civil proceedings involving copyright or related rights, each Party shall provide for a presumption that, in the absence of proof to the contrary, the person whose name is indicated as the author, performer, or producer of the work, performance, or phonogram in the usual manner is the designated right holder in such work, performance, or phonogram.

9. Notwithstanding the other provisions of this Article, a Party may limit the remedies available against use by governments or by third parties authorised by a government, without the authorisation of the right holder, to the payment of remuneration, provided that the Party complies with the provisions of Part II of the TRIPS Agreement specifically addressing that use. In other cases, the remedies under this Article shall apply or, where these remedies are inconsistent with a Party’s law, declaratory judgments and adequate compensation shall be available.

18
. In determining the amount of damages for infringement of intellectual property rights, a Party shall provide that its judicial authorities have the authority to consider, inter alia, any legitimate measure of value the right holder submits, which may include lost profits or the value of the infringed goods or services measured by the market price or the suggested retail price.

23. Each Party shall provide that its authorities have the authority to require the applicant, with respect to provisional measures, to provide any reasonably available evidence in order to satisfy themselves with a sufficient degree of certainty that the applicant’s right is being infringed or that such infringement is imminent, and to order the applicant to provide a security or equivalent assurance sufficient to protect the defendant and to prevent abuse. Each Party shall provide that such security or equivalent assurance does not unreasonably deter recourse to procedures for such provisional measures. 


24. Each Party may provide that if the provisional measures are revoked, if they lapse due to any act or omission by the applicant, or if it is subsequently found that there has been no infringement of an intellectual property right, the judicial authorities have the authority to order the applicant, upon request of the defendant, to provide the defendant appropriate compensation for any injury caused by these measures.
