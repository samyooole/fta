Where similar provisions with respect to a taxation measure exist under this Agreement and under a tax convention, the procedural provisions of the tax convention alone shall be used, by the competent authorities identified in the tax convention, to resolve any issue related to such provisions arising under this Agreement. 


4.	 Notwithstanding paragraphs 2 and 3: 


(a) 	Article 202 (National Treatment and Market Access for Goods -National Treatment) and such other provisions of this Agreement as are necessary to give effect to that Article applies to taxation measures to the same extent as does Article III of the GATT 1994; and 


(b) 	Article 210 (National Treatment and Market Access for Goods - Export Taxes) applies to taxation measures. 

5. 	Subject to paragraphs 2, 3, and 6: 


(a) 	Articles 903 (Cross-Border Trade in Services - National Treatment) and Article 1102 (Financial Services - National Treatment) apply to taxation measures on income, capital gains or on the taxable capital of corporations that relate to the purchase or consumption of particular services; and 


(b) 	Articles 803 and 804 (Investment - National Treatment and Most-Favoured Nation Treatment), 903 and 904 (Cross-Border Trade in Services - National Treatment and Most-Favoured Nation Treatment) and 1102 and 1103 (Financial Services - National Treatment and Most-Favoured Nation Treatment) apply to all taxation measures, other than those on income, capital gains or on the taxable capital of corporations. 

6. Paragraph 5 shall not: 


(a) 	impose any most-favoured-nation obligation with respect to an advantage accorded by a Party pursuant to a tax convention; 


(b) 	impose on a Party any national treatment obligation with respect to the conditioning of a receipt, or continued receipt, of an advantage relating to the contributions to, or income of, pension trusts or pension plans on a requirement that the Party maintain continuous jurisdiction over the pension trust or pension plan;

(e) 	apply to the continuation or prompt renewal of a non-conforming provision of any existing taxation measure;

(g) 	apply to any new taxation measure that is aimed at ensuring the equitable and effective imposition or collection of taxes (including, for greater certainty, any measure that is taken by a Party in order to ensure compliance with the Party’s taxation system or to prevent the avoidance or evasion of taxes) and that does not arbitrarily discriminate between persons, goods or services of the Parties. 

7. Subject to paragraphs 2 and 3, and without prejudice to the rights and obligations of the Parties under paragraph 4, Article 807 (Investment - Performance Requirements) shall apply to taxation measures. 


8. Notwithstanding paragraphs 2 and 3, Article 812 (Investment - Expropriation) shall apply to taxation measures except that no investor may invoke that Article as the basis for a claim under Article 819 (Investment - Claim by an Investor of a Party on Its Own Behalf) or 820 (Investment - Claim by an Investor of a Party on Behalf of an Enterprise), where it has been determined pursuant to this paragraph that a taxation measure is not an expropriation. The investor shall refer the issue of whether a measure is not an expropriation for a determination to the designated authorities of the Parties at the time that it gives notice under subparagraph 1(c) of Article 823 (Investment - Conditions Precedent to Submission of a Claim to Arbitration). If, within a period of six months from the date of such referral, the designated authorities do not agree to consider the issue or, having agreed to consider it, fail to agree that the measure is not an expropriation, the investor may submit its claim to arbitration under Article 824 (Investment - Submission of a Claim to Arbitration).  


9. 	In order to give effect to paragraphs 1 to 3: 


(a) 	Where in a dispute between Parties, an issue arises as to whether a measure of a Party is a taxation measure, either Party may refer the issue to the designated authorities of the Parties. The designated authorities shall decide the issue of whether the measure is a taxation measure, and their decision shall bind any Tribunal constituted pursuant to Section B of Chapter Eight (Investment) for the dispute. Where the designated authorities have not decided the issue within six months of the referral, the Tribunal shall decide the issue in place of the designated authorities. 


(b) 	Where in connection with a claim by an investor of a Party, an issue arises as to whether a measure is a taxation measure, the Party that has received notice of intention to submit a claim or against which an investor of a Party has submitted a claim may refer the issue to the designated authorities of the Parties. The designated authorities shall decide the issue of whether the measure is a taxation measure, and their decision shall bind any Tribunal formed pursuant to Section B of Chapter Eight (Investment) with jurisdiction over the claim. A Tribunal seized of a claim in which the issue arises may not proceed pending receipt of the decision of the designated authorities. Where the designated authorities have not decided the issue within six months of the referral, the Tribunal shall decide the issue in place of the designated authorities. 


(c) 	Where in a dispute between Parties, an issue arises as to whether a tax convention prevails over this Agreement, a Party to the dispute may refer the issue to the designated authorities of the Parties. The designated authorities shall consider the issue and decide whether the tax convention prevails. If within six months of the referral of the issue to the designated authorities, they decide with respect to the measure that gives rise to the issue that the tax convention prevails, no procedures concerning that measure may be initiated under Article 2106 (Dispute Settlement - Establishment of a Panel). No procedures concerning the measure may be initiated during the period that the issue is under consideration by the designated authorities. 


(d) 	Where prior to the submission of a claim by an investor of a Party, an issue arises as to whether a tax convention prevails over this Agreement, the Party that has received notice of intention to submit a claim may refer the issue to the designated authorities of the Parties. The designated authorities shall consider the issue and decide whether the tax convention prevails. If within six months of the referral of the issue to the designated authorities, they decide with respect to the measure that gives rise to the issue that the tax convention prevails, no claim concerning that measure may be submitted under Article 824 (Investment - Submission of a Claim to Arbitration). No claim concerning the measure may be submitted during the period that the issue is under consideration by the designated authorities. An investor of a Party that fails to identify a taxation measure in its notice of intention to submit a claim may not submit a claim concerning that measure under Article 824 (Investment - Submission of a Claim to Arbitration). 

10. Where an investor invokes Article 812 (Investment - Expropriation) as the basis for a claim under Article 819 (Investment - Claim by an Investor of a Party on Its Own Behalf) or 820 (Investment - Claim by an Investor of a Party on Behalf of an Enterprise), any determination under paragraph 8 of whether a measure is an expropriation shall be made concurrently with any decision by the designated authorities under subparagraph 9(b) of the issue whether the measure is a taxation measure. 


11. The designated authorities seized of an issue under paragraphs 8 or 9 may agree to modify the time period allowed for their consideration of the issue.
