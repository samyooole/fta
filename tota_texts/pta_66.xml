Preference shall be given to price-based measures which shall be progressively relaxed as balance of payments conditions improve and eliminated when conditions no longer justify their maintenance.  The EFTA State or Jordan, as the case may be, shall inform the other Parties and the Joint Committee forthwith, if possible, prior to their introduction and shall provide a time schedule for their removal. The Joint Committee shall, upon the request of any other Party, examine the need for maintaining the measures taken.</article>
      <article number="ARTICLE 25" name="Procedure For The Application Of Safeguard Measures" article_identifier="7517">1.

2. Without prejudice to paragraph 6, a Party which considers resorting to safeguard measures shall promptly notify the other Parties and the Joint Committee thereof and supply all relevant information. Consultations between the Parties shall take place without delay in the Joint Committee with a view to finding a commonly acceptable solution. 


3. 	(a) As regards Articles 18 the Parties concerned shall give to the Joint Committee all the assistance required in order to examine the case and, where appropriate, eliminate the practice objected to.  If the Party in question fails to put an end to the practice objected to within the period fixed by the Joint Committee or if the Joint Committee fails to reach an agreement after consultations, or after thirty days following referral for such consultations, the Party concerned may adopt the appropriate measures to deal with the difficulties resulting from the practice in question. 


(b) 	As regards Article 20, the exporting Party shall be informed of the dumping case as soon as the authorities of the importing Party have initiated an investigation. Where no end has been put to the dumping within the meaning of Article VI of the GATT 1994 or no other satisfactory solution has been reached within 30 days of the notification being made, the importing Party may adopt appropriate measures. 


(c) 	As regards Article 21 and 23, the Joint Committee shall examine the case or the situation and may take any decision needed to put an end to the difficulties notified by the Party concerned.  In the absence of such a decision within thirty days of the matter being referred to the Joint Committee, the Party concerned may adopt the measures necessary in order to remedy the situation. 


(d) 	As regards Article 32, the Party concerned shall supply the Joint Committee with all relevant information required for a thorough examination of the situation with a view to seeking a commonly acceptable solution. If the Joint Committee fails to reach such a solution or if a period of ninety days has elapsed from the date of notification, the Party concerned may take appropriate measures. 

4. The safeguard measures taken shall be notified immediately to the Parties and to the Joint Committee.  They shall be restricted with regard to their extent and to their duration to what is strictly necessary in order to rectify the situation giving rise to their 

application and shall not be in excess of the injury caused by the practice or the difficulty in question. Priority shall be given to such measures that will least disturb the functioning of this Agreement.  The measures taken by Jordan against an action or an omission of an EFTA State may only affect the trade with that State. The measures taken against an action or omission of Jordan may only be taken by that or those EFTA States the trade of which is affected by the said action or omission. 

5. The safeguard measures taken shall be the object of regular consultations within the Joint Committee with a view to their relaxation, substitution or abolition, when conditions no longer justify their maintenance. 


6. Where exceptional circumstances requiring immediate action make prior examination impossible, the Party concerned may, in the cases of Articles 20, 21 and 23 apply forthwith the precautionary and provisional measures strictly necessary to remedy the situation.  The measures shall be notified without delay and consultations between the Parties shall take place as soon as possible within the Joint Committee.</article>
      <article number="ARTICLE 26" name="Security Exceptions" article_identifier="7518">Nothing in this Agreement shall prevent a Party from taking any measures which it considers necessary: 


(a) 	to prevent the disclosure of information contrary to its essential security interests; 


(b) 	for the protection of its essential security interests or for the implementation of international obligations or national policies 


(i) 	relating to the traffic in arms, ammunition and implements of war, provided that such measures do not impair the conditions of competition in respect of products not intended for specifically military purposes, and to such traffic in other goods, materials and services as is carried on directly or indirectly for the purpose of supplying a military establishment; or 


(ii) 	relating to the non-proliferation of biological and chemical weapons, nuclear weapons or other nuclear explosive devices; or
