  Bilateral safeguard measures</article>
      <article number="ARTICLE 104" name="Application Of A Bilateral Safeguard Measure" article_identifier="31120">1. Notwithstanding Sub-Section B.2 (Multilateral Safeguard Measures),
  if as a result of the reduction or elimination of a customs duty under
  this Agreement, a product originating in a Party is being imported
  into the territory of the other Party in such increased quantities, in
  absolute terms or relative to domestic production, and under such
  conditions so as to constitute a substantial cause or threat of
  serious injury to domestic producers of like or directly competitive
  products, the importing Party may take appropriate measures under the
  conditions and in accordance with the procedures laid down in this
  Sub-Section.

  2. If the conditions in paragraph 1 are met, the safeguard measures of
  the importing Party may only consist of one of the following:

  (a) suspension of the further reduction of the rate of customs duty on
  the product concerned provided for under this Agreement; or

  (b) increase in the rate of customs duty on the product concerned to a
  level which does not exceed the lesser of:

  (i) the most-favoured nation applied rate of customs duty on the
  product in effect at the time the measure is taken; or

  (ii) the most-favoured nation applied rate of customs duty on the
  product in effect on the day immediately preceding the date of entry
  into force of this Agreement.

  3. In case of products which were already fully liberalised before the
  entry into force of this Agreement following tariff preferences
  granted before the entry into force of this Agreement, the EU Party
  shall examine with special care whether increased imports result from
  the reduction or elimination of customs duties under this Agreement.

  4. None of the above measures shall be applied within the limits of
  the preferential duty free tariff quotas granted by this Agreement.</article>
      <article number="ARTICLE 105" name="Conditions And Limitations" article_identifier="31121">1. A bilateral safeguard measure may not be applied:

  (a) except to the extent, and for such time, as may be necessary to
  prevent or remedy the situation described in Article 104 or 109;

  (b) for a period exceeding two years. The period may be extended by
  another two years if the competent authorities of the importing Party
  determine, in conformity with the procedures specified in this
  Sub-Section, that the measure continues to be necessary to prevent or
  remedy the situations described in Article 104 or 109, provided that
  the total period of application of a safeguard measure, including the
  period of initial application and any extension thereof, does not
  exceed four years; or

  (c) beyond the expiration of the transition period, except with the
  consent of the other Party. "Transition period" means ten
  years from the date of entry into force of this Agreement. For any
  good for which the Schedule in Annex I (Elimination of Customs Duties)
  of the Party applying the measure provides for tariff elimination of
  ten or more years, transition period means the tariff elimination
  period for the goods set out in that Schedule, plus three years.

  2. When a Party ceases to apply a bilateral safeguard measure, the
  rate of customs duty shall be the rate that would have been in effect
  for the good, according to the Schedule of that Party.</article>

  difficult to repair, a Party may apply a bilateral safeguard measure
  on a provisional basis, without complying with the requirements of
  Article 116, paragraph 1 of this Chapter, pursuant to a preliminary
  determination that there is clear evidence that imports of a product
  originating in the other Party have increased as the result of the
  reduction or elimination of a customs duty under this Agreement, and
  that such imports cause or threaten to cause the situations described
  in Article 104 or 109. The duration of any provisional measure shall
  not exceed two hundred days, during which time the Party shall comply
  with the relevant procedural rules laid down in Sub-Section B.4
  (Procedural Rules Applicable to Bilateral Safeguard Measures). The
  Party shall promptly refund any tariff increases if the investigation
  described in Sub-Section B.4 does not result in a finding that the
  requirements of Article 104 are met. The duration of any provisional
  measure shall be counted as part of the period described in Article
  105, paragraph 1(b). The importing Party concerned shall inform the
  other Party concerned upon taking such provisional measures and it
  shall immediately refer the matter to the Association Committee for
  examination if the other Party so requests.</article>

  the Party whose products are subject to the measure in order to
  mutually agree on appropriate trade liberalising compensation in the
  form of concessions having substantially equivalent trade effect. The
  Party shall provide an opportunity for such consultations no later
  than thirty days after the application of the bilateral safeguard
  measure.

  2. If the consultations under paragraph 1 do not result in an
  agreement on trade liberalising compensation within thirty days, the
  Party whose products are subject to the safeguard measure may suspend
  the application of substantially equivalent concessions to the trade
  of the Party applying the safeguard measure.</article>
      <article number="ARTICLE 108" name="Time Lapse In Between Two Measures" article_identifier="31124">No safeguard measure referred to in this Sub-Section shall be applied

  the safeguard measure was applied for the immediately preceding period
  has elapsed.</article>

  outermost regions of the EU Party in such increased quantities and
  under such conditions as to cause or threaten to cause serious
  deterioration in the economic situation of the outermost region(s)
  concerned of the EU Party, the EU Party, after having examined
  alternative solutions, may exceptionally take safeguard measures
  limited to the territory of the region(s) concerned.

  2. Without prejudice to the provisions of paragraph 1, other rules
  laid down in this Sub-Section applicable to bilateral safeguards are
  also applicable to any safeguard adopted under this Article.

  3. The Association Council may discuss whether in cases of threat of,
  or serious deterioration in the economic situation of extremely

  proceeding may be initiated by the competent investigating authority
  on its own initiative, upon receipt of information from one or more
  Member States of the European Union, or upon a written application by
  entities specified in domestic legislation. In the cases when the
  proceeding is initiated on the basis of a written application, the
  entity filing the application shall demonstrate that it is
  representative of the domestic industry producing a good like or
  directly competitive with the imported good.

  2. Once the written applications have been filed, these shall promptly
  be made available for public inspections, except for the confidential
  information contained.

  3. Upon initiation of a safeguard proceeding, the competent
  investigating authority shall publish a notice of initiation of the
  proceeding in the official journal of the Party. The notice shall
  identify the entity which filed the written application, if
  applicable, the imported good that is the subject of the proceeding
  and its subheading and the tariff item number under which it is
  classified, the nature and timing of the determination to be made, the
  time and place of the public hearing or the period within which
  interested parties may apply to be heard orally by the investigating
  authority, the period within which interested parties may make known
  their views in writing and submit information, the place at which the
  written application and any other non-confidential documents filed in
  the course of the proceeding may be inspected and the name, address
  and telephone number of the office to be contacted for more
  information.

  4. With respect to a safeguard proceeding initiated on the basis of a
  written application filed by an entity asserting that it is
  representative of the domestic industry, the competent investigating
  authority shall not publish the notice required by paragraph 3 without
  first assessing carefully that the written application meets the
  requirements of its domestic legislation.</article>
      <article number="ARTICLE 112" name="Investigation" article_identifier="31128">1. A Party may apply a safeguard measure only following an
  investigation by the competent investigating authority of that Party

  investigation shall include reasonable public notice to all interested
  parties and public hearings or other appropriate means in which
  importers, exporters and other interested parties could present
  evidence and their views, including the opportunity to respond to the
  presentations of other parties.

  2. Each Party shall ensure that its competent investigating authority
  completes any such investigation within twelve months of its date of
  initiation.</article>
      <article number="ARTICLE 113" name="Evidence Of Injury And Causal Link" article_identifier="31129">1. In conducting its proceeding, the competent investigating authority
  shall evaluate all relevant factors of an objective and quantifiable
  nature having a bearing on the situation of the domestic industry, in
  particular the rate and amount of the increase in imports of the good
  concerned in absolute terms or relative to domestic production, the
  share of the domestic market taken by increased imports, and changes
  in the level of sales, production, productivity, capacity utilisation,
  profits and losses, and employment.

  2. The determination whether increased imports have caused or are
  threatening to cause the situations described in Article 104 or 109,
  shall not be made, unless the investigation demonstrates, on the basis
  of objective evidence, the existence of a clear causal link between
  increased imports of the good concerned and the situations described
  in Article 104 or 109. Where factors other than increased imports are,
  at the same time, causing the situations described in Article 104 or
  109, such injury or serious deterioration in the economic situation
  shall not be attributed to increased imports.</article>

  appear in person or by counsel, to present evidence and to be heard on
  serious injury or threat of serious injury, and the appropriate
  remedy; or

  (b) provide an opportunity to all interested parties to be heard where
  they have made a written application within the period laid down in
  the notice of initiation showing that they are actually likely to be
  affected by the outcome of the investigation and that there are

  not be disclosed without permission of the Party submitting it.
  Parties providing confidential information may be requested to furnish
  non-confidential summaries thereof or, if such parties indicate that
  such information cannot be summarised, the reasons why a summary
  cannot be provided. However, if the competent investigating authority
  finds that a request for confidentiality is not warranted and if the
  party concerned is either unwilling to make the information public or
  to authorise its disclosure in generalised or summary form, the
  authority may disregard such information unless it can be demonstrated
  to their satisfaction from appropriate sources that the information is
  correct.</article>

  in Article 104 or 109 exists, it shall immediately refer the matter to
  the Association Committee for examination. The Association Committee
  may make any recommendation needed to remedy the circumstances which
  have arisen. If no recommendation has been made by the Association
  Committee aimed at remedying the circumstances, or no other
  satisfactory solution has been reached within thirty days of the
  matter being referred to the Association Committee, the importing
  Party may adopt the appropriate measures to remedy the circumstances
  in accordance with this Sub-Section.

  (a) to require only marking or labelling relevant to consumers or
  users of the product or to indicate the product's conformity with the
  mandatory technical requirements [7];

  (b) if it is necessary in view of the risk of the products to human,
  animal or plant health or life, the environment, or national safety,

  of a label, in particular that the information be placed in a specific
  part of the product or in a given format or size.

  the goods, the Parties shall permit the following:

  (i) information in other languages in addition to the language
  required in the country of destination of the goods;

  (ii) international nomenclatures, pictograms, symbols or graphics; and

  (iii) additional information to that required in the country of
  destination of the goods;

  (e) the Party shall, where legitimate objectives under the TBT
  Agreement are not compromised and the information can properly reach
  the consumer, endeavour to accept non-permanent or detachable labels,
  or marking or labelling in the accompanying documentation rather than
  physically attached to the product; and

  (f) the Parties shall allow that labelling and corrections to
  labelling take place in the country of destination prior to the
  commercialisation of the goods.

  3. Taking into account paragraph 2, the Parties agree that, when a
  Party requires marking or labelling of textiles, clothing or footwear,
  the following information alone may be required to be permanently
  marked:

  lists of commitments in accordance with Chapters 2, 3 and 4 of this
  Title, the Parties subscribe to the understanding defined in the
  following paragraphs.

  2. CPC 84 [21], the United Nations code used for describing computer
  and related services, covers the basic functions used to provide all
  computer and related services: computer programs defined as the sets
  of instructions required to make computers work and communicate
  (including their development and implementation), data processing and
  storage, and related services, such as consultancy and training
  services for staff of clients. Technological developments have led to
  the increased offering of these services as a bundle or package of
  related services that can include some or all of these basic
  functions. For example, services such as web or domain hosting, data
  mining services and grid computing each consist of a combination of
  basic computer services functions.

  3. Computer and related services, regardless of whether they are
  delivered via a network, including the Internet, include all services
  that provide:

  (a) consulting, strategy, analysis, planning, specification, design,
  development, installation, implementation, integration, testing,
  debugging, updating, support, technical assistance, or management of
  or for computers or computer systems; or

  (b) computer programs defined as the sets of instructions required to
  make computers work and communicate (in and of themselves), plus
  consulting, strategy, analysis, planning, specification, design,
  development, installation, implementation, integration, testing,
  debugging, updating, adaptation, maintenance, support, technical
  assistance, management or use of or for computer programs; or

  (c) data processing, data storage, data hosting or database services;
  or

  (d) maintenance and repair services for office machinery and
  equipment, including computers; and

  (e) training services for staff of clients, related to computer
  programs, computers or computer systems, and not elsewhere classified.

  4. Computer and related services enable the provision of other
  services (for example financial services) by both electronic and other

  procurement policies, procedures, or contractual means, provided they
  are not inconsistent with this Title.</article>
      <article number="ARTICLE 211" name="General Principles" article_identifier="31227">1. With respect to any measure and any covered procurement, each
  Party, including its procuring entities, shall accord to the goods and
  services of the other Party and to the suppliers of the other Party
  offering the goods or services of any Party, treatment no less
  favourable than the treatment the Party, including its procuring
  entities, accords to domestic goods, services and suppliers.

  2. With respect to any measure regarding covered procurement, a Party,
  including its procuring entities, shall not:

  (a) treat a locally established supplier less favourably than another
  locally established supplier on the basis of degree of foreign
  affiliation or ownership; nor

  (b) discriminate against a locally established supplier on the basis
  that the goods or services offered by that supplier for a particular
  procurement are goods or services of the other Party.

  3. Any EU Party supplier or service provider established in one
  Republic of the CA Party shall be accorded in all other Republics of
  the CA Party treatment no less favourable than the treatment the
  latter accord to their own suppliers or service providers with respect
  to any measure regarding a covered procurement.

  Any supplier or service provider from a Republic of the CA Party
  established in one Member State of the European Union shall be
  accorded in all other Member States of the European Union treatment no
  less favourable than the treatment the latter accord to their own
  suppliers or service providers with respect to any measure regarding a
  covered procurement.

  The Parties shall not introduce new requirements on the local
  establishment or registration of suppliers and service providers
  wishing to submit a tender in a covered procurement that would set
  suppliers and service providers of the other Party at a competitive
  disadvantage. Existing requirements will be subject to a review within
  ten years from the entry into force of this Agreement [32].

  Use of Electronic Means

  4. If a procuring entity conducts a covered procurement by electronic
  means, it shall:

  (a) ensure that the procurement is conducted using information
  technology systems and software, including those related to
  authentication and encryption of information, that are generally
  available and interoperable with other generally available information
  technology systems and software; and

  (b) maintain mechanisms that ensure the integrity of requests for
  participation and tenders, including establishment of the time and
  receipt and the prevention of inappropriate access.

  Conduct of Procurement

  5. A procuring entity shall conduct covered procurement in a
  transparent and impartial manner, that avoids conflicts of interest
  and prevents corruptive practices and that is consistent with this
  Title using methods such as open tendering, selective tendering and
  limited tendering. Additionally, the Parties shall establish or
  maintain sanctions against such corruptive practices.

  Rules of Origin

  6. For purposes of covered procurement, no Party shall apply rules of
  origin to goods or services imported from or supplied by another Party
  that are different from the rules of origin the Party applies, at the
  same time, in the normal course of trade to imports or supplies of the
  same goods or services from the same Party.

  Offsets

  7. Subject to the exceptions contained in this Title or the annexes
  pertaining thereto, no Party shall seek, take account of, impose or
  enforce offsets.</article>

  2. The CA Party shall perform all reasonable efforts in order to
  develop a single point of access at regional level. The EU Party shall
  provide technical and financial assistance in order to develop,
  establish and maintain such a single point of access. This cooperation
  is addressed in Title VI (Economic and Trade Development) of Part III
  of this Agreement. The implementation of this provision is subject to
  the materialisation of the initiative on technical and financial
  assistance for the development, establishment and maintenance of a
  single point of access at Central American level.

  procurement in the appropriate media listed in Appendix 3 (Media for
  Publication of Notices) to Annex XVI. Each notice shall include the

  Annex XVI. These notices shall be accessible by electronic means free
  of charge through a single point of access at regional level, if and
  where they exist.

  Notice of Planned Procurement

  2. Procuring entities are encouraged to publish, as early as possible,
  each year, a notice regarding their future procurement plans
  (hereinafter referred to as "notice of planned
  procurement"). The notice shall include the subject-matter of the
  procurement and the approximate date of the publication of the notice
  of intended procurement or in which the procurement may be held.

  3. A procuring entity may, if domestic legislation so foresees, use a
  notice of planned procurement as a notice of intended procurement
  provided that it includes as much of the information in Appendix 4
  (Notice of Intended Procurement) as available and a statement that
  interested suppliers shall express their interest in the procurement
  to the procuring entity.</article>
      <article number="ARTICLE 214" name="Conditions For Participation" article_identifier="31230">1. A procuring entity shall limit any conditions for participation in
  a procurement to those that are essential to ensure that a supplier
  has the legal and financial capacities and the commercial and
  technical abilities to undertake the relevant procurement.

  2. In assessing whether a supplier satisfies the conditions for
  participation, a procuring entity shall evaluate the financial,
  commercial and technical abilities of the supplier on the basis of
  that supplier's business activities both in and out of the territory
  of the Party of the procuring entity, and it may not impose the
  condition that, in order for a supplier to participate in a
  procurement, that supplier must have previously been awarded one or
  more contracts by a procuring entity of a given Party or that the
  supplier must have prior work experience in the territory of a given
  Party.

  3. In making this assessment, the procuring entity shall base its
  evaluation on the conditions that it has specified in advance in
  notices or tender documentation.

  4. A procuring entity may exclude a supplier on grounds such as
  bankruptcy, false declarations, significant deficiencies in
  performance of any substantive requirement or obligation under a prior
  contract or contracts, judgments regarding crimes or other judgments
  regarding serious public offences, professional misconduct, failure to
  pay taxes or similar reasons.

  Each Party may adopt or maintain procedures to declare ineligible for
  participation in the Party's procurements, either indefinitely or for
  a specified time, suppliers that the Party has found to have engaged
  in fraudulent or other illegal actions in relation to procurement.
  Upon request of the other Party, a Party shall identify, to the extent
  practicable, the suppliers determined to be ineligible under these
  procedures, and, where appropriate, exchange information regarding
  those suppliers or the fraudulent or illegal action.

  5. The procuring entity may ask the tenderer to indicate in the tender
  any share of the contract the tenderer may intend to subcontract to
  third parties and any proposed subcontractors. This indication shall
  be without prejudice of questioning the principal economic operator's
  liability.</article>
      <article number="ARTICLE 215" name="Qualification Or Registration Of Suppliers" article_identifier="31231">Selective Tendering

  1. Where a procuring entity intends to use selective tendering, the
  entity shall:

  (a) include in the notice of intended procurement at least the
  information specified in paragraph 1 of Appendix 4 (Notice of Intended
  Procurement), to Annex XVI and invite suppliers to submit a request
  for participation; and

  (b) provide, by the commencement of the time-period for tendering, at
  least the information specified in paragraph 2 of Appendix 4 (Notice
  of Intended Procurement) to Annex XVI to the qualified or registered
  suppliers.

  2. A procuring entity shall recognise as qualified suppliers any
  domestic suppliers and any suppliers of the other Party that meet the
  conditions for participation in a particular procurement, unless the
  procuring entity states in the notice of intended procurement any
  limitation on the number of suppliers that will be permitted to tender
  and the criteria for selecting the limited number of suppliers.

  3. Where the tender documentation is not made publicly available from
  the date of publication of the notice referred to in paragraph 1, a
  procuring entity shall ensure that those documents are made available
  at the same time to all qualified suppliers selected in accordance
  with paragraph 2.

  List of Suppliers

  4. A procuring entity may maintain a list of suppliers, provided that
  a notice inviting interested suppliers to apply for inclusion in the
  list is published annually, and where published by electronic means,
  made available continuously in the appropriate medium listed in
  Appendix 3 (Media for Publication of Notices) to Annex XVI. Such a
  notice shall include the information set out in Appendix 5 (Notice
  Inviting Interested Suppliers to Apply for Inclusion in a List of
  Suppliers) to Annex XVI.

  5. Notwithstanding paragraph 4, where a list of suppliers will be
  valid for three years or less, a procuring entity may publish the
  notice referred to in that paragraph only once, at the beginning of
  the period of validity of the list, provided that the notice states
  the period of validity and that further notices will not be published.

  6. A procuring entity shall allow suppliers to apply at any time for
  inclusion on a list of suppliers and shall include on the list within
  a reasonable short time all suppliers that have complied with the
  corresponding requirements.

  use a notice inviting suppliers to apply for inclusion in a list of
  suppliers as a notice of intended procurement, provided that:

  (a) the notice is published in accordance with paragraph 4 and
  includes the information required by Appendix 5 (Notice Inviting
  Interested Suppliers to Apply for Inclusion in a List of Suppliers)
  and as much of the information required by Appendix 4 (Notice of
  Intended Procurement) to Annex XVI as is available, and contains a
  statement that it constitutes a notice of intended procurement;

  (b) the procuring entity promptly provides to suppliers that have
  expressed an interest to the entity in a given procurement, sufficient
  information to permit them to assess their interest in the
  procurement, including all remaining information required by Appendix
  4 (Notice of Intended Procurement) to Annex XVI, to the extent that
  such information is available; and

  (c) a supplier having applied for inclusion on a list of suppliers in
  accordance with paragraph 6, may be allowed to tender in a given
  procurement, where there is sufficient time for the procuring entity
  to examine whether it satisfies the conditions for participation.

  8. A procuring entity shall promptly inform any supplier that submits
  a request for participation or application for inclusion on a list of
  suppliers of the procuring entity's decision with respect to the
  request.

  9. Where a procuring entity rejects a supplier's request to qualify or
  application for inclusion on a list of suppliers, ceases to recognise
  a supplier as qualified, or removes a supplier from a list of
  suppliers, the entity shall promptly inform the supplier and, on
  request of the supplier, promptly provide the supplier with a written
  explanation of the reasons for its decision.

  10. The Parties shall indicate in Section F (General Notes) to
  Appendix 1 (Coverage) to Annex XVI, which entities may use lists of
  suppliers.</article>
      <article number="ARTICLE 216" name="Technical Specifications" article_identifier="31232">1. A procuring entity shall not prepare, adopt or apply any technical
  specification or prescribe any conformity assessment procedure with
  the purpose or the effect of creating unnecessary obstacles to
  international trade.

  2. In prescribing the technical specifications for the goods or
  services being procured, a procuring entity shall, where appropriate:

  (a) set out the technical specifications in terms of performance and
  functional requirements, rather than design or descriptive
  characteristics; and

  (b) base the technical specifications on international standards,
  where these exist; otherwise, on national technical regulations,
  recognized national standards or building codes.

  3. Where design or descriptive characteristics are used in the
  technical specifications, a procuring entity shall indicate, where
  appropriate, that it will consider tenders of equivalent goods or
  services that demonstrably fulfil the requirements of the procurement
  by including such words as "or equivalent" in the tender
  documentation.

  4. A procuring entity shall not prescribe technical specifications
  that require or refer to a particular trademark or trade name, patent,
  copyright, design, type, specific origin, producer or supplier, unless
  there is no other sufficiently precise or intelligible way of
  describing the procurement requirements and provided that, in such
  cases, the entity includes words such as "or equivalent" in
  the tender documentation.

  5. A procuring entity shall not seek or accept, in a manner that would
  have the effect of precluding competition, advice that may be used in
  the preparation or adoption of any technical specification for a
  specific procurement, from a person that may have a commercial
  interest in the procurement.

  6. For greater certainty, this Article is not intended to preclude a
  procuring entity from preparing, adopting, or applying technical
  specifications to promote the conservation of natural resources or
  protect the environment.</article>

  of intended procurement, such documentation shall include a complete
  description of the issues set out in Appendix 8 (Tender Documentation)
  to Annex XVI.

  2. A procuring entity shall promptly provide, upon request, the tender
  documentation to any supplier participating in the procurement; and
  reply to any reasonable request for relevant information made by a
  supplier participating in the procurement, provided that such
  information does not give that supplier an advantage over its
  competitors in the procurement and that the request was presented
  within the corresponding time limits.

  3. Where, in the course of a procurement, a procuring entity modifies
  or amends the criteria or requirements set out in the notice of
  intended procurement or tender documentation provided to participating
  suppliers, it shall transmit in writing all such modifications:

  (a) to all suppliers that are participating at the time the

  participation;

  (ii) no tenders that conform to the essential requirements of the

  absence of competition for technical reasons, the goods or services

  alternative or substitute exists;

  (c) for additional deliveries by the original supplier of goods and
  services that were not included in the initial procurement where a
  change of supplier for such additional goods or services:

  (i) cannot be made for economic or technical reasons such as
  requirements of inter-changeability or inter-operability with existing
  equipment, software, services or installations procured under the
  initial procurement; and

  (f) where additional construction services that were not included in
  the initial contract but fell under the objectives of the original
  tender documentation, have, due to unforeseeable circumstances, become
  necessary to complete the construction services described therein.

  construction services may not exceed fifty per cent of the amount of
  the initial contract;

  (g) in so far as is strictly necessary where, for reasons of urgency
  brought about by events unforeseeable by the procuring entity, the

  the supplier that the entity has determined to be capable of
  fulfilling the terms of the contract and that, based solely on the
  evaluation criteria specified in the notices and tender documentation,

  3. Nothing in this Title shall be construed to require a Party,
  including its procuring entities, authorities and review bodies, to
  disclose confidential information where disclosure would impede law
  enforcement; might prejudice fair competition between suppliers; would
  prejudice the legitimate commercial interests of particular persons,
  including the protection of intellectual property; or would otherwise

      <article number="ARTICLE 225" name="Domestic Review Procedures" article_identifier="31241">1. Each Party shall establish or maintain timely, effective,
  transparent and non-discriminatory administrative or judicial review
  procedures through which a supplier may present a challenge with
  respect to the obligations of a Party and its entities under this
  Title that may arise in the context of a covered procurement, in which
  the supplier has, or has had, an interest. The procedural rules for
  all challenges shall be in writing and made generally available.

  2. Each Party may foresee in its domestic legislation, that in the
  event of a complaint by a supplier arising in the context of a covered
  procurement, it shall encourage its procuring entity and the supplier
  to seek resolution of the complaint through consultation. The
  procuring entity shall accord impartial and timely consideration to
  any such complaint in a manner that is not prejudicial to the
  supplier's participation in ongoing or future procurement or his right
  to seek corrective measures under the administrative or judicial
  review procedure.

  3. Each supplier shall be allowed a sufficient period of time to
  prepare and submit a challenge, which in no case shall be less than
  ten days from the time when the basis of the challenge became known or
  reasonably should have become known to the supplier.

  4. Each Party shall establish or designate at least one impartial
  administrative or judicial authority that is independent of its
  procuring entities to receive and review a challenge by a supplier
  arising in the context of a covered procurement.

  5. Where a body other than an authority referred to in paragraph 4
  initially reviews a challenge, the Party shall ensure that the
  supplier may appeal the initial decision to an impartial
  administrative or judicial authority that is independent of the
  procuring entity whose procurement is the subject of the challenge. A
  review body that is not a court shall either be subject to judicial
  review or have procedural guarantees that provide for:

  (a) the procuring entity shall respond in writing to the challenge and
  disclose all relevant documents to the review body;

  (b) the participants to the proceedings (hereinafter referred to as
  "the participants") shall have the right to be heard prior
  to a decision of the review body being made on the challenge;

  (c) the participants shall have the right to be represented and
  accompanied;

  (d) the participants shall have access to all proceedings; and

  (e) decisions or recommendations relating to challenges by suppliers
  shall be provided, within a reasonable time, in writing, with an
  explanation of the basis for each decision or recommendation.

  6. Each Party shall adopt or maintain procedures that provide for:

  (a) prompt interim measures to preserve the supplier's opportunity to
  participate in the procurement. Such interim measures may result in
  suspension of the procurement process. The procedures may provide that
  overriding adverse consequences for the interests concerned, including
  the public interest, may be taken into account when deciding whether
  such measures should be applied. Just cause for not acting shall be
  provided in writing; and

  (b) corrective action or compensation for the loss or damages
  suffered, in accordance with each Party's legislation, in cases where
  a review body has determined that there has been a breach or a failure
  as set out in paragraph 1.</article>

  procurement under this Title, the Party shall:

  (a) notify the other Party or Parties concerned in writing; and

  (b) include in the notification a proposal of appropriate compensatory
  adjustments to the other Party to maintain a level of coverage
  comparable to that existing prior to the modification.

  2. Notwithstanding subparagraph 1(b), a Party does not need to provide
  compensatory adjustments where:

  (a) the modification in question is a minor amendment or rectification
  of a purely formal nature; or

  (b) the proposed modification refers to an entity over which the Party
  has effectively eliminated its control or influence.

  The Parties may make minor amendments or rectifications of a purely
  formal nature to their coverage under this Title, in accordance with
  the provisions of Title XIII (Specific Tasks in Trade Matters of the
  Bodies established under this Agreement) of Part IV of this Agreement.

  3. If the EU Party or the Republic of the CA Party concerned does not
  agree that:

  (a) the adjustment proposed under subparagraph 1(b) is adequate to
  maintain a comparable level of mutually agreed coverage;

  under subparagraph 2(a); or

  (c) the proposed modification refers to an entity over which the Party
  has effectively eliminated its control or influence under subparagraph
  2(b),

  it must object in writing within thirty days of receipt of the
  notification referred to in paragraph 1 or be deemed to have agreed to
  the adjustment or proposed modification including for the purposes of
  Title X (Dispute Settlement) of Part IV of this Agreement.

  modification, rectification, or minor amendment, including where no
  objection has been made within thirty days under paragraph 3, the
  modifications shall be made in conformity with the provisions of
  paragraph 6.

  "type", "imitation", "like" or similar;

  origin of the product or any other use that constitutes an act of
  unfair competition in the manner set forth in Article 10bis of the
  Paris Convention.

  nothing in this Agreement shall be construed to require a Party to
  prevent continued and similar use of a particular geographical
  indication of the other Party in connection with goods or services by

  territory concerned [37].

  2. Similarly, the Parties may, in accordance with their domestic or
  regional legislation, establish the grounds for rejecting the
  protection of geographical indications, including the option not to
  grant protection to a geographical indication where, in the light of a
  reputed or well-known trademark, protection is liable to mislead
  consumers as to the true identity of the product.

  commerce, in such a manner as to minimize the risks of further
  infringements. In considering requests for such corrective measures,
  the Party's judicial authorities may take into account, inter alia,
  the gravity of the infringement, as well as the interests of third
  parties holding ownership, possessory, contractual, or secured
  interests.

  grant their judicial authorities the faculty to take into account,
  inter alia, the gravity of the infringement, as well as the interests

  of a corresponding gravity. In appropriate cases, remedies available
  shall also include the seizure, forfeiture and destruction of the
  infringing goods and of any materials and implements the predominant
  use of which has been in the commission of the offence. The Parties

  phytosanitary measures are essential for the free circulation of goods
  within Central America and the EU Party.

  3. Accordingly, and taking into account the different level of
  development of their respective regional economic integration
  processes, the Parties agree on the following provisions.</article>
      <article number="ARTICLE 304" name="Customs Procedures" article_identifier="31320">1. In the area of customs, no later than two years as from the entry
  into force of this Agreement, the custom authority of the Republic of
  the CA Party of first entry shall grant a reimbursement of the duty
  paid when such goods are exported into another Republic of the CA
  Party. Such goods shall be subject to the customs duty in the Republic
  of the CA Party of import.

  2. The Parties shall endeavour to put into place a mechanism that will
  ensure that goods originating in Central America or in the European
  Union in accordance with Annex II (Concerning the Definition of the
  Concept of "Originating Products" and Methods of
  Administrative Cooperation) to this Agreement, entering their
  respective territory and having been cleared at customs of import, may
  no longer be subject to customs duties or charges having an equivalent
  effect or to quantitative restrictions or measures having an
  equivalent effect.

  3. The Parties agree that their respective customs legislation and
  procedures shall provide for the use of a single administrative
  document or electronic equivalent in the EU Party and in the CA Party,
  respectively, for the purposes of establishing customs declarations at
  import and export. The CA Party commits to achieving this objective
  three years after the entry into force of this Agreement.

  4. The Parties shall also ensure that customs legislation, procedures
  and customs related requirements at import applicable to goods
  originating in Central America or in the European Union are harmonised
  at regional level. The CA Party commits to achieving this objective at
  the latest five years after the entry into force of this Agreement.</article>
      <article number="ARTICLE 305" name="Technical Barriers To Trade" article_identifier="31321">1. In the area of technical regulations and conformity assessment
  procedures:

  (a) the Parties agree that the Member States of the European Union
  will ensure that products originating in Central America which have
  been legally placed on the market of one Member State of the European
  Union, can also be marketed in the other Member States of the European
  Union, provided that the product provides an equivalent level of
  protection of the various legitimate interests involved (principle of
  mutual recognition);

  (b) in this respect, the Member States of the European Union will
  accept, provided that the product provides an equivalent level of
  protection of the various legitimate interests involved, that a
  product which has fulfilled the conformity assessment procedures
  required by one of the Member States of the European Union, can be
  placed on the market of the other Member States of the European Union,
  without having to undergo an additional conformity assessment
  procedure.

  2. When harmonised regional import requirements exist, products
  originating in the European Union should comply with the regional
  requirements in order to be legally marketed in the Republic of the CA
  Party of first import. In accordance with this Agreement, where a
  product is covered by harmonised legislation and a registration has to
  be carried out, the registration made in one of the Republics of the
  CA Party should be accepted by all the other Republics of the CA
  Party, once the internal procedures have been fulfilled.

  3. Furthermore, where registration is required, the Republics of the
  CA Party will accept that products should be registered by group or
  family of products.

  4. The CA Party agrees to adopt, within five years of the entry into
  force of this Agreement, the regional technical regulations and
  conformity assessment procedures that are currently in preparation and
  listed in Annex XX (List of Central American Technical Regulations
  (RTCA) in the Process of Harmonisation) to this Agreement, and to
  continue work towards the harmonisation of technical regulations and
  conformity assessment procedures, and to promote the development of

  EU Party;

  (b) promote the harmonisation and improvement of sanitary and
  phytosanitary requirements and procedures in the CA Party and the EU
  Party, including to achieve the use of a single import certificate, a
  single list of establishments, a single sanitary import check and a
  single fee for products imported from the EU Party into the CA Party;

  (c) endeavour to ensure the mutual recognition of the verifications
  carried out by the Republics of the CA Party in any Member State of
  the European Union.

  2. The EU Party shall ensure that from the date of entry into force of
  this Agreement, animals, animal products, plants and plant products,
  lawfully put on the market, can freely move within the territory of
  the EU Party without checks at the internal borders, provided that
  they comply with the relevant sanitary and phytosanitary requirements.

  3. The CA Party shall ensure that from the date of entry into force of
  this Agreement, animals, animal products, plants and plant products
  shall benefit from regional transit facilitation in the territories of
  the CA Party in accordance with Resolution No. 219-2007
  (COMIECO-XLVII) and subsequent related instruments. For the purposes
  of this Title, in case of imports from the EU Party, regional transit
  facilitation means that EU Party's goods may enter through any CA
  Party's border inspection post and may transit through the region,
  from one Republic of the CA Party to another, complying with the
  sanitary and phytosanitary requirements of the Party of final
  destination, where a sanitary or phytosanitary inspection may be
  conducted.

  4. Provided that they comply with the relevant sanitary and
  phytosanitary requirements and in accordance with the existing
  mechanisms in the Central American regional integration process, the
  CA Party undertakes to grant animals, animal products, plants and
  plant products listed in Annex XIX (List of Products referred to in
  Paragraph 4 of Article 306), the following treatment: when imported
  into the territory of a Republic of the CA Party, the Competent
  Authorities will check the certificate issued by the Competent
  Authority of the EU Party, and may perform a sanitary or phytosanitary
  inspection; once clearance is provided, a product included in Annex
  XIX may only be subject to a random sanitary or phytosanitary
  inspection at the point of entry of the Republic of the CA Party of
  final destination.

  For products included in List 1 of Annex XIX, the above obligation
  will apply no later than two years after the entry into force of this
  Agreement.

  For products included in List 2 of Annex XIX, the above obligation
  will apply no later than five years after the entry into force of this
  Agreement.

  5. Without prejudice to the rights and obligations of the Parties (the
  EU Party or the Republics of the CA Party) under the WTO Agreement and
  the sanitary and phytosanitary procedures and requirements established
  by each Party, an importing Party should not be required to grant a
  more favourable treatment to products imported from the exporting
  Party than the treatment given by the exporting Party in its
  intra-regional trade.

  6. The Association Council may modify Annex XIX (List of Products
  referred to in Paragraph 4 of Article 306) following recommendations
  by the Sub-Committee on Sanitary and Phytosanitary Matters to the
  Association Committee, in line with the procedure established in Title
  XIII (Specific Tasks in Trade Matters of the Bodies Established under
  this Agreement) of Part IV of this Agreement.

  delay, take any measure necessary to comply in good faith with the
  Panel ruling on the subject matter, and the disputing Parties will
  endeavour to agree on the period of time for compliance.

  the Panel, shall take into consideration the possible effects of the
  measure determined to be inconsistent with this Agreement on the level
  of development of the Party complained against.

  3. In the event that full and timely compliance with the Panel's
  ruling does not occur, compensation or suspension of obligations may
  be applied as temporary measures. In this event, the disputing Parties
  shall endeavour to agree on compensation rather than apply suspension
  of obligations. However, neither compensation nor suspension of
  obligations is preferred to full and timely implementation of the
  Panel's ruling.

  4. Where a Panel ruling applies to more than one Republic of the CA
  Party as the complaining Party or the Party complained against, any
  compensation or suspension of obligations pursuant to this Title shall
  apply individually for each Republic of the CA Party, to which effect
  the Panel ruling shall individually determine the level of
  nullification or impairment caused by the violation for each Republic
  of the CA Party.</article>

  Association Committee of the agreed reasonable period of time and,
  where possible, the specific measures that the Party complained
  against intends to adopt.

  3. Failing agreement between the disputing Parties on the reasonable
  period of time to comply with the Panel ruling within the time period
  established in paragraph 2, the complaining Party may request the
  original Panel to determine the reasonable period of time. Such
  request shall be made in writing and notified to the other disputing
  Party with copy to the Association Committee. The Panel shall notify
  its ruling to the disputing Parties with copy to the Association
  Committee within twenty days from the date of the submission of the
  request. Where a Panel ruling applies to more than one Republic of the
  CA Party, the Panel shall determine the reasonable period of time for
  each Republic of the CA Party.

  reasonable period of time of any measure that it has taken to comply
  with the Panel ruling and provide the details such as the effective

  explanation of how the measure taken to comply brings the Party
  complained against into compliance.

  2. In the event of disagreement between the disputing Parties
  concerning the existence or compatibility of any measure notified
  under paragraph 1 with the provisions referred to in Article 309, the
  complaining Party may request in writing the original Panel to rule on
  the matter. Such request shall identify the specific measure at issue
  and it shall explain how such measure is inconsistent with the
  provisions referred to in Article 309. The Panel shall notify its
  ruling within forty five days of the date of the submission of the
  request. Where a Panel ruling applies to more than one Republic of the
  CA Party, the Panel shall, where necessary under the circumstances,
  issue its ruling pursuant to this Article for each Republic of the CA
  Party.

  3. In the event of the original Panel, or some of its members, being

  to comply with the Panel ruling prior to the expiry of the reasonable
  period of time, as established in Article 316, paragraph 1, or if the
  Panel rules that the measure notified under said Article 316,
  paragraph 1 is inconsistent with that Party's obligations under the
  provisions referred to in Article 309, the Party complained against
  shall, if so requested by the complaining Party, present an offer for
  compensation. Where a Panel ruling applies to more than one Republic
  of the CA Party, each of the Republics of the CA Party shall present
  or be presented with, as the case may be, an offer for compensation,
  taking account of the level of nullification or impairment determined
  pursuant to Article 314, paragraph 4, as well as any measure notified
  under Article 316, paragraph 1. The EU Party will endeavour to
  exercise due restraint when requesting compensation pursuant to this
  paragraph.

  2. If no agreement on compensation is reached within thirty days of
  the end of the reasonable period of time or of the notification of the
  Panel ruling under Article 316 that a measure taken to comply is
  inconsistent with the provisions referred to in Article 309, any
  complaining Party shall be entitled, upon notification to the Party
  complained against with copy to the Association Committee, to suspend
  obligations arising from any provision referred to in Article 309 at a
  level equivalent to the nullification or impairment caused by the
  violation. The notification shall indicate the obligations that the
  complaining Party intends to suspend. The complaining Party may
  implement the suspension ten days after the date of the notification,
  unless the Party complained against has requested a ruling by a Panel
  under paragraph 3. Where a Panel ruling applies to more than one
  Republic of the CA Party, suspension of obligations shall be applied
  individually to each non compliant Republic of the CA Party or by each
  Republic of the CA Party as the case may be, taking account of the
  individual level of nullification or impairment determined pursuant to
  Article 314, paragraph 4, as well as any measure notified under
  Article 316, paragraph 1.

  3. If any Party complained against considers that the level of
  suspension is not equivalent to the nullification or impairment caused
  by the violation, it may request in writing the original Panel to rule
  on the matter. Such request shall be notified to the complaining Party
  with copy to the Association Committee prior to the expiry of the ten
  day period referred to in paragraph 2. The Panel shall notify its
  ruling on the level of the suspension of obligations to the disputing
  Parties with copy to the Association Committee within thirty days of
  the date of the submission of the request. Obligations shall not be
  suspended until the Panel has notified its ruling, and any suspension
  shall be consistent with the Panel ruling.

  4. In the event of the original Panel, or some of its members, being
  unable to reconvene, the relevant procedures laid down in Article 312
  shall apply. The time period for notifying the ruling shall be forty
  five days from the date of the submission of the request referred to
  in paragraph 3.

  5. When suspending benefits pursuant to paragraph 1, the EU Party will
  endeavour to exercise appropriate moderation, taking into
  consideration, among other factors, the likely impact on the economy
  and level of development of the Party complained against, and opt for
  measures conducive to bringing the Party complained against into
  compliance, and least likely to adversely affect the attainment of the
  objectives of this Agreement.

  6. The suspension of obligations shall be temporary and shall be
  applied only until any specific measure or measures found to be
  inconsistent with the provisions referred to in Article 309, has or
  have been brought into full conformity with those provisions, as
  established under Article 318, or until any of the disputing Parties
  have agreed to settle the dispute.</article>
      <article number="ARTICLE 318" name="Review Of Any Measure Taken To Comply After The Suspension Of Obligations" article_identifier="31334">1. The Party complained against shall notify the complaining Party,

  [1] The term "existing" implies that the paragraph applies
  exclusively to any existing provision of the WTO Agreement and not to
  any amendments or provisions agreed later than the finalization of
  this Agreement.

  [2] For the purposes of this Agreement, unless otherwise specified,
  the terms "good" and "product" shall be considered
  equivalent.

  [3] For goods which do not benefit from preferential treatment,
  "customs duty" shall be understood as the "base
  rate" indicated in each of the Party's schedules.

  [4] The Parties recognise that Article 158 of Chapter 6 (Exceptions
  Related to Goods) of Title II also applies to this Article.

  [5] The Parties recognise that Article 158 of Chapter 6 (Exceptions
  Related to Goods) of Title II also applies to this Article.

  [6] In Parties where their legislation requires entry into force at
  the same time as publication, the Government shall ensure that
  operators are informed of any new measures of the kind referred to in
  this paragraph sufficiently in advance.

  [7] Where labelling for fiscal purposes is required, such a
  requirement shall be formulated in a manner that is not more trade
  restrictive than necessary to fulfil a legitimate objective.

  [8] The sole fact of requiring a visa for natural persons of certain
  country and not for those of others shall not be regarded as
  nullifying or impairing benefits under a specific commitment.

  [9] In line with its notification of the EC Treaty to the WTO (doc.
  WT/REG39/1), the EU understands that the concept of "effective
  and continuous link" with the economy of a Member State enshrined
  in Article 54 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union
  (TFEU) is equivalent to the concept of "substantive business
  operations" provided in Article V, paragraph 6, of the GATS.

  [10] The terms "constitution" and "acquisition" of
  a juridical person shall be understood as including capital
  participation in a juridical person with a view to establishing or
  maintaining lasting economic links.

  [11] A juridical person is controlled by another juridical person if
  the latter has the power to name a majority of its directors or
  otherwise to legally direct its actions.

  [12] Investment protection, other than the treatment deriving from
  Article 165, including investor-state dispute settlement procedures,
  is not covered by this Chapter.

  [13] Without prejudice to the scope of activities which may be
  considered as cabotage under the relevant domestic legislation,
  national cabotage under this Chapter covers transportation of
  passengers or goods between a port or point located in a Republic of
  the CA Party or a Member State of the European Union and another port
  or point located in the same Republic of the CA Party or Member State
  of the European Union, including on its continental shelf, and traffic
  originating and terminating in the same port or point located in a
  Republic of the CA Party or Member State of the European Union.

  [14] Subparagraphs 2(a), 2(b) and 2(c) do not cover measures taken in
  order to limit the production of an agricultural product.

  [15] Each Party may require that in the case of incorporation under
  its own law, investors must adopt a specific legal form. To the extent
  that such requirement is applied in a non-discriminatory manner, it
  does not need to be specified in Annex X (Lists of Commitments on
  Establishment) in order to be maintained or adopted by the Parties.

  [16] Without prejudice to the scope of activities which may be
  considered as cabotage under the relevant domestic legislation,
  national cabotage under this Chapter covers transportation of
  passengers or goods between a port or point located in a Republic of
  the CA Party or a Member State of the European Union and another port
  or point located in the same Republic of the CA Party or Member State
  of the European Union, including on its continental shelf, and traffic
  originating and terminating in the same port or point located in a
  Republic of the CA Party or Member State of the European Union.

  [17] Subparagraph 2(c) does not cover measures of a Party which limit
  inputs for the supply of services.

  [18] The recipient establishment may be required to submit a training
  programme covering the duration of the stay for prior approval,
  demonstrating that the purpose of the stay is for training.

  [19] CPC means the Central Products Classification as set out in
  Statistical Office of the United Nations, Statistical Papers, Series
  M, No 77, CPC prov, 1991.

  [20] The service contract referred to under (d) and (e) shall comply
  with the laws, regulations and requirements of the Party where the
  contract is executed.

  [21] CPC means the Central Product Classification as set out in the
  Statistical Office of the United Nations, Statistical papers, Series
  M, No. 77, CPC prov, 1991.

  [22] The Parties understand that these services are covered by this
  Section to that extend that they are considered public
  telecommunications services in accordance with the applicable domestic
  legislation.

  [23] For the purposes of this Section, the term authorisation shall be
  understood to include the licenses, concessions, permits, registers
  and any other authorizations that a Party may require to supply
  telecommunications services.

  [24] Only for the EU Party, "or margin squeeze".

  [25] Paragraphs 3, 4 and 5, do not apply with respect to suppliers of
  commercial mobile services, nor rural telecommunications services
  suppliers. For greater certainty, nothing in this Article shall be
  construed to preclude a Party from imposing the requirements set out
  in this Article on suppliers of commercial mobile services.

  [26] For greater certainty, the obligation contained in this Article
  shall not be considered a specific commitment pursuant to Article 194,
  paragraph 2(a).

  [27] For greater certainty, the scope of application of this
  definition shall not imply the supply of a transport service. For the
  purpose of this definition, single transport document shall refer to a
  document that permits customers to conclude a single contract with a
  shipping company for a door to door transport operation.

  [28] The provisions of this subparagraph refer only to access to
  services but shall not allow the supply of services.

  [29] Measures that are aimed at ensuring the equitable or effective
  imposition or collection of direct taxes include measures taken by a
  Party under its taxation system which:(a)apply to non-resident
  investors and services suppliers in recognition of the fact that the
  tax obligation of non-residents is determined with respect to taxable
  items sourced or located in the Party's territory; or(b)apply to
  non-residents in order to ensure the imposition or collection of taxes
  in the Party's territory; or(c)apply to non-residents or residents in
  order to prevent the avoidance or evasion of taxes, including
  compliance measures; or(d)apply to consumers of services supplied in
  or from the territory of the other Party in order to ensure the
  imposition or collection of taxes on such consumers derived from
  sources in the Party's territory; or(e)distinguish investors and
  service suppliers subject to tax on worldwide taxable items from other
  investors and service suppliers, in recognition of the difference in
  the nature of the tax base between them; or(f)determine, allocate or
  apportion income, profit, gain, loss, deduction or credit of resident
  persons or branches, or between related persons or branches of the
  same person, in order to safeguard the Party's tax base.Tax terms or
  concepts in paragraph (f) of this provision and in this footnote are
  determined according to tax definitions and concepts, or equivalent or
  similar definitions and concepts, under the domestic law of the Party
  taking the measure.

  [30] For greater certainty, the exceptions included in Part V of this
  Agreement, as well as the exceptions included in Title III
  (Establishment, Trade in Services and Electronic Commerce) of Part IV
  of this Agreement, shall also be applicable to this Title.

  [31] The reintroduction of safeguard measures shall not be subject to
  authorisation of the Parties.

  [32] For greater certainty, nothing in this Article shall affect trade
  in services covered by Title III (Establishment, Trade in Services and
  Electronic Commerce), and its Annexes on Lists of Commitments on
  Establishment, Lists of Commitments on Cross-Border Supply of
  Services, Reservations on Key Personnel and Graduate Trainees of the
  EU Party, Lists of Commitments of the Republics of the CA Party on
  Business Service Sellers and List of Commitments of the Republics of
  the CA Party on Key Personnel and Graduate Trainees.

  [33] The EU Party shall promote that the academic exchanges take the
  form of grants and that the professional and business exchanges take
  the form of internships in organisations of the European Union,
  strengthening of MSMEs, development of innovating industries and
  creation of professional clinics so that the acquired knowledge may be
  applied in the Central American region.

  [34] A Party may maintain the reservations made under the Rome
  Convention and the WPPT regarding the rights conferred in this Article
  and this shall not be construed as a violation of this provision.

  [35] The obligations from paragraph 1 shall be considered as fulfilled
  when, in the course of the applicable procedures for protection of a
  name as a geographical indication:(a)the administrative decision
  rejects the registration of the name; or(b)the administrative decision
  is challenged under the instances established under each Party's
  domestic legislation.

  [36] For the purpose of this Article, the Republics of the CA Party
  consider that the term "like product" may be understood as
  "identical or confusingly similar".

  [37] For the EU Party, the date of application for protection shall be
  the date of entry into force of this Agreement for the names listed in
  Annex XVII.

  [38] When the legislation of a Party so provides, individual character
  of such designs may also be required.

  [39] For the purposes of Article 260 to 272 the notion of
  "intellectual property rights" shall at least cover the
  following rights: copyright, including copyright in computer programs
  and databases, and related rights; rights related to patents;
  trademarks; industrial designs; lay-out-designs (topographies) of
  integrated circuits; geographical indications; plant varieties; trade
  names in so far as these are protected as exclusive rights in the
  domestic law concerned.

  [40] For greater certainty, this paragraph shall not be construed as
  limiting the scope of the analysis to be carried out in the cases of
  application of agreements between undertakings, decision by
  associations of undertaking and concerted practices between
  undertakings as established in the national competition laws of the
  Parties.

  [41] Discrimination means a measure which does not comply with
  national treatment, as set out in the relevant provisions of this
  Agreement.

  [42] For the EU Party, this refers to the Constitutions of the Member
  States of the European Union, to the Treaty on the European Union, to
  the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union and to the Charter
  of Fundamental Rights of the European Union.

  [43] For greater certainty, the reference to the multilateral
  environmental agreements in Article 287, paragraph 2, shall encompass
  those protocols, amendments, annexes and adjustments ratified by the
  Parties.

  [44] The Board on Trade and Sustainable Development shall report on
  its activities to the Association Committee.

  [45] In the exercise of the right of the Parties to use existing
  advisory groups for the implementation of the provisions of this
  Title, the Parties shall offer existing bodies the opportunity to
  reinforce and develop their activities with the new perspectives and
  areas of work provided by this Title. To this end, the Parties may use
  existing national advisory groups.

  [46] For greater certainty, policy making and other such typical
  government functions shall not be delegated to the Civil Society
  Dialogue Forum.

  [47] For instance, where a provision of Part IV of this Agreement
  establishes an obligation for all Republics of the CA Party to fulfil
  a specified requirement by a stipulated date, the failure of more than
  one Republic of the CA Party to have done so would be a matter falling
  under this paragraph.

  [48] For instance, where an import ban on a product has been
  implemented, and said import ban applies to exports of that product
  from more than one Republic of the CA Party, this would be a matter
  falling under this paragraph.

  [49] Where a disputing Party is composed of two or more Republics of
  the CA Party, they shall act jointly in the procedure established in
  Article 312.

  [50] As of the entry into force of this Agreement:(a)the Parties shall
  send the Association Council their lists of candidates within seventy
  five days;(b)the Association Council shall approve or reject the
  candidates in the lists within one hundred twenty days;(c)the Parties
  shall send a list of additional candidates to replace the rejected
  candidates within one hundred fifty days;(d)the list of candidates
  shall be finalised within one hundred eighty days.

  [51] For example, in cases concerning standards and technical
  requirements, the mediator should have a background in relevant
  international standard setting bodies.

  [52] The contact point designated by the CA Party shall be used for
  the exchange of information regarding its collective obligations in
  accordance with Article 352, paragraph 2 of Part V (Final Provisions)
  of this Agreement and shall work under direct instructions agreed by
  the Republics of the CA Party.

  [53] For purposes of the obligation to designate a contact point by
  the CA Party, "date of entry into force" shall mean the date
  in which all the Republics of the CA Party have brought this Agreement
  into force, according to paragraph 4 of Article 353.

  [54] Implementation of Modifications Approved by the Association
  Council:1.In the case of Costa Rica, decisions of the Association
  Council under Article 345, paragraph 2(a) will be equivalent to the
  instrument referred to in Article 121.4, third paragraph (Protocolo de
  Menor Rango) of the Constitución Política de la República de Costa
  Rica.2.In the case of Honduras, decisions of the Association Council
  under Article 345, paragraph 2(a) will be equivalent to the instrument
