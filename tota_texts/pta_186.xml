As provided in this Article, the Parties shall replace judicial review of final antidumping and countervailing duty determinations with binational panel review. 


2. Either Party may request that a panel review, based upon the administrative record, a final antidumping or countervailing duty determination of a competent investigating authority of either Party to determine whether such determination was in accordance with the antidumping or countervailing duty law of the importing Party. For this purpose, the antidumping or countervailing duty law consists of the relevant statutes, legislative history, regulations, administrative practice, and judicial precedents to the extent that a court of the importing Party would rely on such materials in reviewing a final determination of the competent investigating authority. Solely for purposes of the panel review provided for in this Article, the antidumping and countervailing duty statutes of the Parties, as those statutes may be amended from time to time, are incorporated into this Agreement. 


3. The panel shall apply the standard of review described in Article 1911 and the general legal principles that a court of the importing Party otherwise would apply to a review of a determination of the competent investigating authority. 


4. A request for a panel shall be made in writing to the other Party within 30 days following the date of publication of the final determination in question in the Federal Register or the Canada Gazette. In the case of final determinations that are not published in the Federal Register or the Canada Gazette, the importing Party shall immediately notify the other Party of such final determination where it involves a good from the other Party, and the other Party may request a panel within 30 days of receipt of such notice. Where the competent investigating authority of the importing Party has imposed provisional measures in an investigation, the other Party may provide notice of its intention to request a panel under this Article, and the Parties shall begin to establish a panel at that time. Failure to request a panel within the time specified in this paragraph shall preclude review by a panel. 


5. Either Party on its own initiative may request review of a final determination by a panel and shall, upon request of a person who would otherwise be entitled under the law of the importing Party to commence domestic procedures for judicial review of a final determination, request such review. 


6. The panel shall conduct its review in accordance with the procedures established by the Parties pursuant to paragraph 14. Where both Parties request a panel to review a final determination, a single panel shall review that determination. 


7. The competent investigating authority that issued the final determination in question shall have the right to appear and be represented by counsel before the panel. Each Party shall provide that other persons who, pursuant to the law of the importing Party, otherwise would have had standing to appear and be represented in a domestic judicial review proceeding concerning the determination of the competent investigating authority, shall have the right to appear and be represented by counsel before the panel. 


8. The panel may uphold a final determination, or remand it for action not inconsistent with the panel's decision. Where the panel remands a final determination, the panel shall establish as brief a time as is reasonable for compliance with the remand, taking into account the complexity of the facts and legal issues involved and the nature of the panel's decision. In no event shall the time permitted for compliance with a remand exceed an amount of time equal to the maximum amount of time (counted from the date of the filing of a 
petit10n, complaint or application) permitted by statute for the competent investigating authority in question to make a final determination in an investigation. If review of the action taken by the competent investigating authority on remand is needed, such review shall be before the same panel, which shall issue a final decision within 90 days of the date on which such remand action is submitted to it. 


9. The decision of a panel under this Article shall be binding on the Parties with respect to the particular matter between the Parties that is before the panel. 


10. This Agreement shall not affect: 
a) 	the judicial review procedures of either Party, or 

b) 	cases appealed under those procedures, 

with respect to determinations other than final determinations. 


11. A final determination shall not be reviewed under any judicial review procedures of the importing Party if either Party requests a panel with respect to that determination within the time limits set forth in this Article. Neither Party shall provide in its domestic legislation for an appeal from a panel decision to its domestic courts. 


12. The provisions of this Article shall not apply where: 
a) 	neither Party seeks panel review of a final determination; 

b) 	a revised final determination is issued as a direct result of judicial review of the original final determination by a court of the importing Party in cases where neither Party sought panel review of that original final determination; or 

c) 	a final determination is issued as a direct result of judicial review that was commenced in a court of the importing Party before the entry into force of this Agreement. 

13. Where, within a reasonable time after the panel decision is issued, a Party alleges that: 

a) 

i) 

a member of the panel was guilty of gross misconduct, bias, 




or a serious conflict of interest, or otherwise materially 




violated the rules of conduct, 


ii) 

the panel seriously departed from a fundamental rule of 




procedure, or 


iii) 

the panel manifestly exceeded its powers, authority 

or 




jurisdiction set forth in this Article, and 
b) any of the actions set out in subparagraph (a) has materially affected the panel's decision and threatens the integrity of the binational panel review process, 

that Party may avail itself of the extraordinary challenge procedure set out in Annex 1904.13.

Such rules shall be based, where appropriate, upon judicial rules of appellate procedure, and shall include rules concerning the content and service of requests for panels, a requirement that the competent investigating authority transmit to the panel the administrative record of the proceeding, the protection of business proprietary and other privileged information (including sanctions against persons participating before panels for improper release of such information), participation by private persons, limits on panel review to errors alleged by the Parties or private persons, filing and service, computation and extensions of time, the form and content of briefs and other papers, pre-and posthearing conferences, oral argument, requests for rehearing, and voluntary terminations of panel reviews. The rules shall be designed to result in final decisions within 315 days of the date on which a request for a panel is made, and shall allow: 

a) 	30 days for the filing of the complaint; 

b) 	30 days for designation or certification of the administrative record and its filing with the panel;

b) 	Canada shall amend section 28(4) of the Federal Court Act to render that section inapplicable; and shall provide in its statutes or regulations that persons (including producers of goods subject to an investigation) have standing to ask Canada to request a panel review where such persons would be entitled to commence domestic procedures for judicial review if the final determination were reviewable by the Federal Court pursuant to section 28;

f) 	Canada shall amend the Special Import Measures Act, and any other relevant provisions of law, to provide that the following actions of the Deputy Minister shall be deemed for the purposes of this Article to be final determinations subject to judicial review:

ii) 	a re-determination by the Deputy Minister pursuant to section 59, and 

iii) a review by the Deputy Minister of an undertaking pursuant to section 53(1); and
