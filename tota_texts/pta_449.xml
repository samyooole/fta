If verifications of identical goods by a Party indicate a pattern of conduct by an importer, exporter or producer of false or unsupported representations relevant to a claim that a good imported into its territory qualifies as an originating good, the Party may withhold preferential tariff treatment to identical goods imported, exported or produced by that person until that person demonstrates that the identical goods qualify as originating. For the purposes of this paragraph, “identical goods” means goods that are the same in all respects relevant to the particular rule of origin that qualifies the goods as originating.

Treatment of Sets 


5. Notwithstanding the textile and apparel product-specific rules of origin set out in Annex 4-A (Textiles and Apparel Product-Specific Rules of Origin), textile and apparel goods put up in sets for retail sale, classified as a result of the application of Rule 3 of the General Rules for the Interpretation of the Harmonized System, shall not be regarded as originating goods unless each of the goods in the set is an originating good or the total value of the non-originating goods in the set does not exceed 10 per cent of the value of the set.

9. Further to Article 9.2 of the TBT Agreement no Party shall refuse to accept conformity assessment results from a conformity assessment body or take actions that have the effect of, directly or indirectly, requiring or encouraging another Party or person to refuse to accept conformity assessment results from a conformity assessment body because the accreditation body that accredited the conformity assessment body:

(b) 	is a non-governmental body; 


(c) 	is domiciled in the territory of a Party that does not maintain a procedure for recognising accreditation bodies, provided that the accreditation body is recognised internationally, consistent with the provisions in paragraph 8;

3. With respect to the mechanisms listed in paragraphs 1 and 2, the Parties recognise that the choice of the appropriate mechanism in a given regulatory context depends on a variety of factors, such as the product and sector involved, the volume and direction of trade, the relationship between Parties’ respective regulators, the legitimate objectives pursued and the risks of non-fulfilment of those objectives. 


4. The Parties shall strengthen their exchange and collaboration on mechanisms to facilitate the acceptance of conformity assessment results, to support greater regulatory alignment and to eliminate unnecessary technical barriers to trade in the region. 


5. A Party shall, on request of another Party, give due consideration to any sector-specific proposal for cooperation under this Chapter.

Among such instruments that do not have the characteristics of an investment are those that do not create any rights protected under the Party’s law. For greater certainty, the foregoing is without prejudice to whether any asset associated with such instruments has the characteristics of an investment.

2. A requirement of a Party that a service supplier of another Party post a bond or other form of financial security as a condition for the cross-border supply of a service does not of itself make this Chapter applicable to measures adopted or maintained by the Party relating to such cross-border supply of the service. This Chapter shall apply to measures adopted or maintained by the Party relating to the posted bond or financial security, to the extent that the bond or financial security is a covered investment. 


3. This Chapter shall not apply to measures adopted or maintained by a Party to the extent that they are covered by Chapter 11 (Financial Services).</article>
      <article number="ARTICLE 9.4" name="National Treatment14" article_identifier="40110">1. Each Party shall accord to investors of another Party treatment no less favourable than that it accords, in like circumstances, to its own investors with respect to the establishment, acquisition, expansion, management, conduct, operation, and sale or other disposition of investments in its territory. 


2. Each Party shall accord to covered investments treatment no less favourable than that it accords, in like circumstances, to investments in its territory of its own investors with respect to the establishment, acquisition, expansion, management, conduct, operation, and sale or other disposition of investments. 
13 For greater certainty, governmental authority is delegated under the Party’s law, including through a legislative grant or a government order, directive or other action transferring or authorising the exercise of governmental authority. 

14 For greater certainty, whether treatment is accorded in “like circumstances” under Article 9.4 (National Treatment) or Article 9.5 (Most-Favoured-Nation Treatment) depends on the totality of the circumstances, including whether the relevant treatment distinguishes between investors or investments on the basis of legitimate public welfare objectives. 

3. For greater certainty, the treatment to be accorded by a Party under paragraphs 1 and 2 means, with respect to a regional level of government, treatment no less favourable than the most favourable treatment accorded, in like circumstances, by that regional level of government to investors, and to investments of investors, of the Party of which it forms a part.</article>
      <article number="ARTICLE 9.5" name="Most-Favoured-Nation Treatment" article_identifier="40111">1.

Each Party shall accord to covered investments treatment in accordance with applicable customary international law principles, including fair and equitable treatment and full protection and security. 


2. For greater certainty, paragraph 1 prescribes the customary international law minimum standard of treatment of aliens as the standard of treatment to be afforded to covered investments. The concepts of “fair and equitable treatment” and “full protection and security” do not require treatment in addition to or beyond that which is required by that standard, and do not create additional substantive rights. The obligations in paragraph 1 to provide: 


(a) 	“fair and equitable treatment” includes the obligation not to deny justice in criminal, civil or administrative adjudicatory proceedings in accordance with the principle of due process embodied in the principal legal systems of the world; and 


(b) 	“full protection and security” requires each Party to provide the level of police protection required under customary international law. 

3. A determination that there has been a breach of another provision of this Agreement, or of a separate international agreement, does not establish that there has been a breach of this Article. 


4. For greater certainty, the mere fact that a Party takes or fails to take an action that may be inconsistent with an investor’s expectations does not constitute a breach of this Article, even if there is loss or damage to the covered investment as a result. 


5. For greater certainty, the mere fact that a subsidy or grant has not been issued, renewed or maintained, or has been modified or reduced, by a Party, does not constitute a breach of this Article, even if there is loss or damage to the covered investment as a result.

(b) 	destruction of its covered investment or part thereof by the latter’s forces or authorities, which was not required by the necessity of the situation, 
the latter Party shall provide the investor restitution, compensation or both, as appropriate, for that loss.

16 Article 9.8 (Expropriation and Compensation) shall be interpreted in accordance with Annex 9B (Expropriation) and is subject to Annex 9-C (Expropriation Relating to Land).

(a) 	in the absence of any specific commitment under law or contract to issue, renew or maintain that subsidy or grant; or 


(b) 	in accordance with any terms or conditions attached to the issuance, renewal, modification, reduction and maintenance of that subsidy or grant,

in regard to any licence contract in existence at the time the requirement is imposed or enforced, or any commitment or undertaking is enforced, or any future licence contract 25 freely entered into between the investor and a person in its territory, provided that the requirement is imposed or the commitment or undertaking is enforced in a manner that constitutes direct interference with that licence contract by an exercise of nonjudicial governmental authority of a Party. For greater certainty, paragraph 1(i) does not apply when the licence contract is concluded between the investor and a Party. 

2. No Party shall condition the receipt or continued receipt of an advantage, in connection with the establishment, acquisition, expansion, management, conduct, operation, or sale or other disposition of an investment of an investor of a Party or of a non-Party in its territory, on compliance with any requirement:

(b) 	Paragraphs 1(f), 1(h) and 1(i) shall not apply: 

25 A “licence contract” referred to in this subparagraph means any contract concerning the licensing of technology, a production process, or other proprietary knowledge. 


(i) 	if a Party authorises use of an intellectual property right in accordance with Article 3126 of the TRIPS Agreement, or to measures requiring the disclosure of proprietary information that fall within the scope of, and are consistent with, Article 39 of the TRIPS Agreement; or

(i) 	necessary to secure compliance with laws and regulations that are not inconsistent with this Agreement; 


(ii) 	necessary to protect human, animal or plant life or health; or 
(iii) 	related to the conservation of living or non-living exhaustible natural resources.

26 The reference to “Article 31” includes any waiver or amendment to the TRIPS Agreement implementing paragraph 6 of the Doha Declaration on the TRIPS Agreement and Public Health (WT/MIN (01)/DEC/2). 

27 The Parties recognise that a patent does not necessarily confer market power. 

28 In the case of Brunei Darussalam, for a period of 10 years after the entry into force of this Agreement for it or until it establishes a competition authority or authorities, whichever occurs earlier, the reference to the Party’s competition laws includes competition regulations. 


(g) 	Paragraphs 2(a) and 2(b) shall not apply to requirements imposed by an importing Party relating to the content of goods necessary to qualify for preferential tariffs or preferential quotas. 


(h) 	Paragraphs (1)(h) and (1)(i) shall not be construed to prevent a Party from adopting or maintaining measures to protect legitimate public welfare objectives, provided that such measures are not applied in an arbitrary or unjustifiable manner, or in a manner that constitutes a disguised restriction on international trade or investment. 

4. For greater certainty, nothing in paragraph 1 shall be construed to prevent a Party, in connection with the establishment, acquisition, expansion, management, conduct, operation, or sale or other disposition of an investment of an investor of a Party or of a non-Party in its territory, from imposing or enforcing a requirement, or enforcing a commitment or undertaking, to employ or train workers in its territory provided that the employment or training does not require the transfer of a particular technology, production process or other proprietary knowledge to a person in its territory. 


5. For greater certainty, paragraphs 1 and 2 shall not apply to any commitment, undertaking or requirement other than those set out in those paragraphs.

3. If a Party considers that a non-conforming measure applied by a regional level of government of another Party, as referred to in paragraph 1(a)(ii), creates a material impediment to investment in relation to the former Party, it may request consultations with regard to that measure. These Parties shall enter into consultations with a view to exchanging information on the operation of the measure and to considering whether further steps are necessary and appropriate.30 
29 With respect to Viet Nam, Annex 9-I (Non-Conforming Measures Ratchet Mechanism) applies. 

30 For greater certainty, any Party may request consultations with another Party regarding a nonconforming measure applied by a central level of government, as referred to in paragraph 1(a)(i). 


4. No Party shall, under any measure adopted after the date of entry into force of this Agreement for that Party and covered by its Schedule to Annex II, require an investor of another Party, by reason of its nationality, to sell or otherwise dispose of an investment existing at the time the measure becomes effective.

that the place shall be in the territory of a State that is a party to the New York Convention. 

2. A non-disputing Party may make oral and written submissions to the tribunal regarding the interpretation of this Agreement. 


3. After consultation with the disputing parties, the tribunal may accept and consider written amicus curiae submissions regarding a matter of fact or law within the scope of the dispute that may assist the tribunal in evaluating the submissions and arguments of the disputing parties from a person or entity that is not a disputing party but has a significant interest in the arbitral proceedings. Each submission shall identify the author; disclose any affiliation, direct or indirect, with any disputing party; and identify any person, government or other entity that has provided, or will provide, any financial or other assistance in preparing the submission. Each submission shall be in a language of the arbitration and comply with any page limits and deadlines set by the tribunal. The tribunal shall provide the disputing parties with an opportunity to respond to such submissions. The tribunal shall ensure that the submissions do not disrupt or unduly burden the arbitral proceedings, or unfairly prejudice any disputing party. 


4. Without prejudice to a tribunal’s authority to address other objections as a preliminary question, such as an objection that a dispute is not within the competence of the tribunal, including an objection to the tribunal’s jurisdiction, a tribunal shall address and decide as a preliminary question any objection by the respondent that, as a matter of law, a claim submitted is not a claim for which an award in favour of the claimant may be made under Article 9.29 (Awards) or that a claim is manifestly without legal merit. 


(a) 	An objection under this paragraph shall be submitted to the tribunal as soon as possible after the tribunal is constituted, and in no event later than the date the tribunal fixes for the respondent to submit its counter-memorial or, in the case of an amendment to the notice of arbitration, the date the tribunal fixes for the respondent to submit its response to the amendment. 


(b) 	On receipt of an objection under this paragraph, the tribunal shall suspend any proceedings on the merits, establish a schedule for considering the objection consistent with any schedule it has established for considering any other preliminary question, and issue a decision or award on the objection, stating the grounds therefor. 


(c) 	In deciding an objection under this paragraph that a claim submitted is not a claim for which an award in favour of the claimant may be made under Article 9.29 (Awards), the tribunal shall assume to be true the claimant’s factual allegations in support of any claim in the notice of arbitration (or any amendment 

thereof) and, in disputes brought under the UNCITRAL Arbitration Rules, the statement of claim referred to in the relevant article of the UNCITRAL Arbitration Rules. The tribunal may also consider any relevant facts not in dispute. 

(d) 	The respondent does not waive any objection as to competence, including an objection to jurisdiction, or any argument on the merits merely because the respondent did or did not raise an objection under this paragraph or make use of the expedited procedure set out in paragraph 5. 

5. In the event that the respondent so requests within 45 days after the tribunal is constituted, the tribunal shall decide on an expedited basis an objection under paragraph 4 or any objection that the dispute is not within the tribunal’s competence, including an objection that the dispute is not within the tribunal’s jurisdiction. The tribunal shall suspend any proceedings on the merits and issue a decision or award on the objection, stating the grounds therefor, no later than 150 days after the date of the request. However, if a disputing party requests a hearing, the tribunal may take an additional 30 days to issue the decision or award. Regardless of whether a hearing is requested, a tribunal may, on a showing of extraordinary cause, delay issuing its decision or award by an additional brief period, which may not exceed 30 days. 


6. When the tribunal decides a respondent’s objection under paragraph 4 or 5, it may, if warranted, award to the prevailing disputing party reasonable costs and attorney’s fees incurred in submitting or opposing the objection. In determining whether such an award is warranted, the tribunal shall consider whether either the claimant’s claim or the respondent’s objection was frivolous, and shall provide the disputing parties a reasonable opportunity to comment. 


7. For greater certainty, if an investor of a Party submits a claim under this Section, including a claim alleging that a Party breached Article 9.6 (Minimum Standard of Treatment), the investor has the burden of proving all elements of its claims, consistent with general principles of international law applicable to international arbitration. 


8. A respondent may not assert as a defence, counterclaim, right of set-off or for any other reason, that the claimant has received or will receive indemnification or other compensation for all or part of the alleged damages pursuant to an insurance or guarantee contract. 


9. A tribunal may order an interim measure of protection to preserve the rights of a disputing party, or to ensure that the tribunal’s jurisdiction is made fully effective, including an order to preserve evidence in the possession or control of a disputing party or to protect the tribunal’s jurisdiction. A tribunal may not order attachment or enjoin the application of a measure alleged to constitute a breach referred to in Article 9.19 (Submission of a Claim to 

Arbitration). For the purposes of this paragraph, an order includes a recommendation. 

10. In any arbitration conducted under this Section, at the request of a disputing party, a tribunal shall, before issuing a decision or award on liability, transmit its proposed decision or award to the disputing parties. Within 60 days after the tribunal transmits its proposed decision or award, the disputing parties may submit written comments to the tribunal concerning any aspect of its proposed decision or award. The tribunal shall consider any comments and issue its decision or award no later than 45 days after the expiration of the 60 day comment period. 


11. In the event that an appellate mechanism for reviewing awards rendered by investor-State dispute settlement tribunals is developed in the future under other institutional arrangements, the Parties shall consider whether awards rendered under Article 9.29 (Awards) should be subject to that appellate mechanism. The Parties shall strive to ensure that any such appellate mechanism they consider adopting provides for transparency of proceedings similar to the transparency provisions established in Article 9.24 (Transparency of Arbitral Proceedings).</article>
      <article number="ARTICLE 9.24" name="Transparency Of Arbitral Proceedings" article_identifier="40130">1. Subject to paragraphs 2 and 4, the respondent shall, after receiving the following documents, promptly transmit them to the non-disputing Parties and make them available to the public:

(b) 	the notice of arbitration; 


(c) 	pleadings, memorials and briefs submitted to the tribunal by a disputing party and any written submissions submitted pursuant to Article 9.23.2 (Conduct of the Arbitration) and Article 9.23.3 and Article 9.28 (Consolidation);

(a) 	engage in direct regulation either in anticipation of an issue that the Party expects may arise or to resolve an issue that has already arisen in the market; 


(b) 	rely on the role of market forces, particularly with respect to market segments that are, or are likely to be, competitive or that have low barriers to entry, such as services provided by telecommunications suppliers that do not own network facilities;2 or 
1 For greater certainty, nothing in this Chapter shall be construed to require a Party to authorise an enterprise of another Party to establish, construct, acquire, lease, operate or supply public telecommunications services, unless otherwise provided for in this Agreement.

(a) 	enforcement of the regulation is not necessary to prevent unreasonable or discriminatory practices; 


(b) 	enforcement of the regulation is not necessary for the protection of consumers; and 


(c) 	forbearance is consistent with the public interest, including promoting and enhancing competition between suppliers of public telecommunications services.</article>

5. Each Party shall ensure that no condition is imposed on access to and use of public telecommunications networks and services, other than as necessary to: 


(a) 	safeguard the public service responsibilities of suppliers of public telecommunications networks and services, in particular their ability to make their networks or services generally available to the public; or

Number Portability 

4. Each Party shall ensure that suppliers of public telecommunications services in its territory provide number portability without impairment to quality and reliability, on a timely basis, and on reasonable and non-discriminatory terms and conditions.6

(c) 	for Viet Nam, this paragraph shall apply to fixed services at such time as it determines that it is technically and economically feasible. Within four years of the date of entry into force of this Agreement for Viet Nam, it shall conduct a review for it to determine the economic feasibility of applying number portability to fixed services. With respect to commercial mobile services, this paragraph shall apply to Viet Nam no later than 2020.

The Parties recognise that a Party, when it has the authority to do so, may choose to adopt or maintain measures affecting rates for wholesale international roaming services with a view to ensuring that those rates are reasonable. If a Party considers it appropriate, it may cooperate on and implement mechanisms with other Parties to facilitate the implementation of those measures, including by entering into arrangements with those Parties. 


4. If a Party (the first Party) chooses to regulate rates or conditions for wholesale international mobile roaming services, it shall ensure that a supplier of public telecommunications services of another Party (the second Party) has access to the regulated rates or conditions for wholesale international mobile roaming services for its customers roaming in the territory of the first Party in circumstances in which:8 
7 For Viet Nam, this paragraph shall not apply with respect to blocks of numbers that have been allocated prior to entry into force of this Agreement.

A Party shall provide that information no later than one year after the date of entry into force of this Agreement for the Party. Each Party shall update that information 
9 For greater certainty, access under this subparagraph to the rates or conditions regulated by the first Party shall be available to a supplier of the second Party only if such regulated rates or conditions are reasonably comparable to those reciprocally regulated under the arrangement referred to in this subparagraph. The telecommunications regulatory body of the first Party shall, in the case of disagreement, determine whether the rates or conditions are reasonably comparable. 

10 For the purposes of this subparagraph, rates or conditions that are reasonably comparable means rates or conditions agreed to be such by the relevant suppliers or, in the case of disagreement, determined to be such by the telecommunications regulatory body of the first Party. 

11 For greater certainty, such additional requirements may include, for example, that the rates provided to the supplier of the second Party reflect the reasonable cost of supplying international mobile roaming services by a supplier of the first Party to a supplier of the second Party, as determined through the methodology of the first Party. 

and provide it to the other Parties on an annual basis or as otherwise agreed. Interested Parties shall endeavour to cooperate on compiling this information into a report to be mutually agreed by the Parties and to be made publicly available.

2. Where physical co-location is not practical for technical reasons or because of space limitations, each Party shall ensure that a major supplier in its territory provides an alternative solution, such as facilitating virtual co-location, based on a generally available offer, on a timely basis, and on terms and conditions and at cost-oriented rates, that are reasonable and non-discriminatory. 


3. A Party may determine, in accordance with its laws and regulations, which premises owned or controlled by major suppliers in its territory are subject to paragraphs 1 and 2. When the Party makes this determination, it shall take into account factors such as the state of competition in the market where co-location is required, whether those premises can be substituted in an economically or technically feasible manner in order to provide a competing service, or other specified public interest factors.

2. A Party may determine, in accordance with its laws and regulations, the poles, ducts, conduits, rights-of-way or any other structures to which it requires major suppliers in its territory to provide access in accordance with paragraph 1. When the Party makes this determination, it shall take into account factors such as the competitive effect of lack of such access, whether such structures can be substituted in an economically or technically feasible manner in order to provide a competing service, or other specified public interest factors.

3. No Party shall accord more favourable treatment to a supplier of telecommunications services in its territory than that accorded to a like service supplier of another Party on the basis that the supplier receiving more favourable treatment is owned by the national government of the Party. 
16 For Chile, this provision shall apply when its telecommunications regulatory body obtains the authority to implement this provision. Nonetheless, Chile shall ensure reasonable and nondiscriminatory access to international submarine cable systems including landing stations in its territory. 

17 For Viet Nam, co-location for international submarine landing stations owned or controlled by the major supplier in the territory of Viet Nam excludes physical co-location. 

18 This paragraph shall not be construed to prohibit a government entity of a Party other than the telecommunications regulatory body from owning equity in a supplier of public telecommunications services.

      <article number="ARTICLE 15.10" name="Limited Tendering" article_identifier="40235">1. Provided that it does not use this provision for the purpose of avoiding competition between suppliers, to protect domestic suppliers or in a manner that discriminates against suppliers of any other Party, a procuring entity may use limited tendering. 


2. If a procuring entity uses limited tendering, it may choose, according to the nature of the procurement, not to apply Article 15.7 (Notices of Intended Procurement), Article 15.8 (Conditions for Participation), Article 15.9 (Qualification of Suppliers), Article 15.11 (Negotiations), Article 15.12 (Technical Specifications), Article 15.13 (Tender Documentation), Article 15.14 (Time Periods) or Article 15.15 (Treatment of Tenders and Awarding of Contracts). A procuring entity may use limited tendering only under the following circumstances: 
(a) 	if, in response to a prior notice, invitation to participate or invitation to tender: 


(i) 	no tenders were submitted or no suppliers requested participation; 


(ii) 	no tenders were submitted that conform to the essential requirements in the tender documentation; 
(iii) 	no suppliers satisfied the conditions for participation; or 

(iv) 	the tenders submitted were collusive, 

provided that the procuring entity does not substantially modify the essential requirements set out in the notices or tender documentation; 


(b) 	if the good or service can be supplied only by a particular supplier and no reasonable alternative or substitute good or service exists for any of the following reasons: 


(i) 	the requirement is for a work of art; 


(ii) 	the protection of patents, copyrights or other exclusive rights; or 
(iii) 	due to an absence of competition for technical reasons; 

(c) 	for additional deliveries by the original supplier or its authorised agents, of goods or services that were not included in the initial procurement if a change of supplier for such additional goods or services: 


(i) 	cannot be made for technical reasons such as requirements of interchangeability or interoperability with existing equipment, software, services or installations procured under the initial procurement, or due to conditions under original supplier warranties; and 


(ii) 	would cause significant inconvenience or substantial duplication of costs for the procuring entity; 

(d) 	for a good purchased on a commodity market or exchange; 


(e) 	if a procuring entity procures a prototype or a first good or service that is intended for limited trial or that is developed at its request in the course of, and for, a particular contract for research, experiment, study or original development. Original development of a prototype or a first good or service may include limited production or supply in order to incorporate the results of field testing and to demonstrate that the prototype or the first good or service is suitable for production or supply in quantity to acceptable quality standards, but does not include quantity production or supply to establish commercial viability or to recover research and development costs. Subsequent procurements of these newly developed goods or services, however, shall be subject 

to this Chapter; 

(f) 	if additional construction services that were not included in the initial contract but that were within the objectives of the original tender documentation have, due to unforeseeable circumstances, become necessary to complete the construction services described therein. However, the total value of contracts awarded for additional construction services may not exceed 50 per cent of the value of the initial contract; 


(g) 	for purchases made under exceptionally advantageous conditions that only arise in the very short term, such as from unusual disposals, liquidation, bankruptcy or receivership, but not for routine purchases from regular suppliers; 


(h) 	if a contract is awarded to the winner of a design contest, provided that: 


(i) 	the contest has been organised in a manner that is consistent with this Chapter; and 


(ii) 	the contest is judged by an independent jury with a view to award a design contract to the winner; or 

(i) 	in so far as is strictly necessary if, for reasons of extreme urgency brought about by events unforeseeable by the procuring entity, the good or service could not be obtained in time by means of open or selective tendering. 
3. For each contract awarded in accordance with paragraph 2, a procuring entity shall prepare a report in writing, or maintain a record, that includes the name of the procuring entity, the value and kind of good or service procured, and a statement that indicates the circumstances and conditions described in paragraph 2 that justified the use of limited tendering.</article>

(ii) 	the market of a non-Party as compared with the price in the same market of imports of a like good of another Party, or significant price suppression, price depression or lost sales in the same market;

However, in these situations, there must be evidence that a prospective domestic producer has made a substantial commitment to commence production and sales of the like good. 

21 For greater certainty, this paragraph shall not be construed to apply to a service that itself is a form of non-commercial assistance. 


(d) 	that services supplied by a Party's state-owned enterprise that has received the non-commercial assistance displace or impede from the market of another Party a like service supplied by a service supplier of that other Party or any other Party; or

(c) 	the market share of the good or service of the Party’s state-owned enterprise declines, but at a significantly slower rate than would have been the case in the absence of the non-commercial assistance. 
The change must manifest itself over an appropriately representative period sufficient to demonstrate clear trends in the development of the market for the good or service concerned, which, in normal circumstances, shall be at least one year. 


3. For the purposes of paragraphs 1(c) and 1(e), price undercutting shall include any case in which such price undercutting has been demonstrated through a comparison of the prices of the good or service of the state-owned enterprise with the prices of the like good or service. 


4. Comparisons of the prices in paragraph 3 shall be made at the same level of trade and at comparable times, and due account shall be taken for factors affecting price comparability. If a direct comparison of transactions is not possible, the existence of price undercutting may be demonstrated on some other reasonable basis, such as, in the case of goods, a comparison of unit values.

(a) 	before the signing of this Agreement; or

A determination of material injury shall be based on positive evidence and involve an objective examination of the relevant factors, including the volume of production by the covered investment that has received non-commercial assistance, the effect of such production on prices for like goods produced and sold by the domestic industry, and the effect of such production on the domestic industry producing like goods.23 


2. With regard to the volume of production by the covered investment that has received non-commercial assistance, consideration shall be given as to whether there has been a significant increase in the volume of production, either in absolute terms or relative to production or consumption in the territory of the Party in which injury is alleged to have occurred. With regard to the effect of the production by the covered investment on prices, consideration shall be given as to whether there has been a significant price undercutting by the goods produced and sold by the covered investment as compared with the price of like goods produced and sold by the domestic industry, or whether the effect of production by the covered investment is otherwise to depress prices to a significant degree or to prevent price increases, which otherwise would have occurred, to a significant degree. No one or several of these factors can necessarily give decisive guidance. 


3. The examination of the impact on the domestic industry of the goods produced and sold by the covered investment that received the non-commercial assistance shall include an evaluation of all relevant economic factors and indices having a bearing on the state of the industry, such as actual and potential decline in output, sales, market share, profits, productivity, return on investments, or utilisation of capacity; factors affecting domestic prices; actual and potential negative effects on cash flow, inventories, employment, wages, growth, ability to raise capital or investments and, in the case of agriculture, whether there has been an increased burden on government

support programmes. This list is not exhaustive, nor can one or several of these factors necessarily give decisive guidance. 


4. It must be demonstrated that the goods produced and sold by the covered investment are, through the effects24 of the non-commercial assistance, causing injury within the meaning of this Article. The demonstration of a causal relationship between the goods produced and sold by the covered investment and the injury to the domestic industry shall be based on an examination of all relevant evidence. Any known factors other than the goods produced by the covered investment which at the same time are injuring the domestic industry shall be examined, and the injuries caused by these other factors must not be attributed to the goods produced and sold by the covered investment that has received non-commercial assistance. Factors which may be relevant in this respect include, among other things, the volumes and prices of other like goods in the market in question, contraction in demand or changes in the patterns of consumption, and developments in technology and the export performance and productivity of the domestic industry. 


5. A determination of a threat of material injury shall be based on facts and not merely on allegation, conjecture or remote possibility and shall be considered with special care. The change in circumstances which would create a situation in which noncommercial assistance to the covered investment would cause injury must be clearly foreseen and imminent. In making a determination regarding the existence of a threat of material injury, there should be consideration of relevant factors25 and of whether the totality of the factors considered lead to the conclusion that further availability of goods produced by the covered investment is imminent and that, unless protective action is taken, material injury would occur. 
24 As set out in paragraphs 2 and 3. 

25 In making a determination regarding the existence of a threat of material injury, a panel pursuant to Chapter 28 (Dispute Settlement) should consider, among other things, such factors as: (a) the nature of the non-commercial assistance in question and the trade effects likely to arise therefrom; (b) a significant rate of increase in sales in the domestic market by the covered investment, indicating a likelihood of substantially increased sales; (c) sufficient freely disposable, or an imminent, substantial increase in, capacity of the covered investment indicating the likelihood of substantially increased production of the good by that covered investment, taking into account the availability of export markets to absorb additional production; (d) whether prices of goods sold by the covered investment will have a significant depressing or suppressing effect on the price of like goods; and (e) inventories of like goods.</article>

A Party may limit those new processes to those that do not claim the use of the product as such. 


3. A Party may exclude from patentability inventions, the prevention within their territory of the commercial exploitation of which is necessary to protect ordre public or morality, including to protect human, animal or plant life or health or to avoid serious prejudice to nature or the environment, provided that such exclusion is not made merely because the exploitation is prohibited by its law. A Party may also exclude from patentability:

(b) 	that is intended to be used in the course of trade on goods or in relation to services that are identical to goods or services for which that trademark is registered. 
126 The Parties understand that a Party may comply with subparagraph (b) by addressing such significant acts under its criminal procedures and penalties for non-authorised uses of protected works, performances and phonograms in its law. 

127 A Party may provide that the volume and value of any infringing items may be taken into account in determining whether the act has a substantial prejudicial impact on the interests of the copyright or related rights holder in relation to the marketplace. 

128 The Parties understand that a Party may comply with its obligation under this paragraph by providing that distribution or sale of counterfeit trademark goods or pirated copyright goods on a commercial scale is an unlawful activity subject to criminal penalties. Furthermore, criminal procedures and penalties as specified in paragraphs 1, 2 and 3 are applicable in any free trade zones in a Party. 

129 A Party may comply with its obligation relating to importation of labels or packaging through its measures concerning distribution. 

130 A Party may comply with its obligations under this paragraph by providing for criminal procedures and penalties to be applied to attempts to commit a trademark offence. 


4. Recognising the need to address the unauthorised copying 131 of a cinematographic work from a performance in a movie theatre that causes significant harm to a right holder in the market for that work, and recognising the need to deter such harm, each Party shall adopt or maintain measures, which shall at a minimum include, but need not be limited to, appropriate criminal procedures and penalties. 


5. With respect to the offences for which this Article requires a Party to provide for criminal procedures and penalties, each Party shall ensure that criminal liability for aiding and abetting is available under its law. 


6. With respect to the offences described in paragraphs 1 through 5, each Party shall provide the following: 


(a) 	Penalties that include sentences of imprisonment as well as monetary fines sufficiently high to provide a deterrent to future acts of infringement, consistent with the level of penalties applied for crimes of a corresponding gravity.132 


(b) 	Its judicial authorities have the authority, in determining penalties, to account for the seriousness of the circumstances, which may include circumstances that involve threats to, or effects on, health or safety.133 


(c) 	Its judicial or other competent authorities have the authority to order the seizure of suspected counterfeit trademark goods or pirated copyright goods, any related materials and implements used in the commission of the alleged offence, documentary evidence relevant to the alleged offence and assets derived from, or obtained through the alleged infringing activity. If a Party requires identification of items subject to seizure as a prerequisite for issuing a judicial order referred to in this subparagraph, that Party shall not require the items to be described in greater detail than necessary to identify them for the purpose of seizure. 


(d) 	Its judicial authorities have the authority to order the forfeiture, at least for serious offences, of any assets derived from or obtained through the infringing activity. 


(e) 	Its judicial authorities have the authority to order the forfeiture or destruction of: 
131 For the purposes of this Article, a Party may treat the term “copying” as synonymous with reproduction. 

132 The Parties understand that there is no obligation for a Party to provide for the possibility of imprisonment and monetary fines to be imposed in parallel. 

133 A Party may also account for such circumstances through a separate criminal offence. 


(i) 	all counterfeit trademark goods or pirated copyright goods; 


(ii) 	materials and implements that have been predominantly used in the creation of pirated copyright goods or counterfeit trademark goods; and 
(iii) 	any other labels or packaging to which a counterfeit trademark has been applied and that have been used in the commission of the offence. 

In cases in which counterfeit trademark goods and pirated copyright goods are not destroyed, the judicial or other competent authorities shall ensure that, except in exceptional circumstances, those goods are disposed of outside the channels of commerce in such a manner as to avoid causing any harm to the right holder. Each Party shall further provide that forfeiture or destruction under this subparagraph and subparagraph (c) shall occur without compensation of any kind to the defendant. 


(f) 	Its judicial or other competent authorities have the authority to release or, in the alternative, provide access to, goods, material, implements, and other evidence held by the relevant authority to a right holder for civil134 infringement proceedings. 


(g) 	Its competent authorities may act upon their own initiative to initiate legal action without the need for a formal complaint by a third person or right holder.135 
7. With respect to the offences described in paragraphs 1 through 5, a Party may provide that its judicial authorities have the authority to order the seizure or forfeiture of assets, or alternatively, a fine, the value of which corresponds to the assets derived from, or obtained directly or indirectly through, the infringing activity.

persons have the legal means to prevent trade secrets lawfully in their control from being disclosed to, acquired by, or used by others (including state-owned enterprises) without their consent in a manner contrary to honest commercial practices.137 As used in this Chapter, trade secrets encompass, at a minimum, undisclosed information as provided for in Article 39.2 of the TRIPS Agreement. 

2. Subject to paragraph 3, each Party shall provide for criminal procedures and penalties for one or more of the following: 


(a) 	the unauthorised and wilful access to a trade secret held in a computer system; 


(b) 	the unauthorised and wilful misappropriation138 of a trade secret, including by means of a computer system; or 


(c) 	the fraudulent disclosure, or alternatively, the unauthorised and wilful disclosure, of a trade secret, including by means of a computer system. 
3. With respect to the relevant acts referred to in paragraph 2, a Party may, as appropriate, limit the availability of its criminal procedures, or limit the level of penalties available, to one or more of the following cases in which: 


(a) 	the acts are for the purposes of commercial advantage or financial gain; 


(b) 	the acts are related to a product or service in national or international commerce; 


(c) 	the acts are intended to injure the owner of such trade secret; 


(d) 	the acts are directed by or for the benefit of or in association with a foreign economic entity; or 


(e) 	the acts are detrimental to a Party’s economic interests, international relations, or national defence or national security. 
137 For the purposes of this paragraph “a manner contrary to honest commercial practices” means at least practices such as breach of contract, breach of confidence and inducement to breach, and includes the acquisition of undisclosed information by third parties that knew, or were grossly negligent in failing to know, that those practices were involved in the acquisition. 

138 A Party may deem the term “misappropriation” to be synonymous with “unlawful acquisition”.</article>
      <article number="ARTICLE 18.79" name="Protection Of Encrypted Program-Carrying Satellite And Cable Signals" article_identifier="40352">1. 	Each Party shall make it a criminal offence to: 

(a) 	manufacture, assemble, modify, 139 import, export, sell, lease or otherwise distribute a tangible or intangible device or system knowing or having reason to know140 that the device or system meets at least one of the following conditions: 


(i) 	it is intended to be used to assist; 


(ii) 	it is primarily of assistance; or 
(iii) 	its principal function is solely to assist, 

in decoding an encrypted program-carrying satellite signal without the

(b) with respect to an encrypted program-carrying satellite signal, wilfully: 


(i) 	receive143 such a signal; or 


(ii) 	further distribute144 such signal, 
knowing that it has been decoded without the authorisation of the lawful distributor of the signal. 

139 For greater certainty, a Party may treat “assemble” and “modify” as incorporated in “manufacture”. 

140 For the purposes of this paragraph, a Party may provide that “having reason to know” may be demonstrated through reasonable evidence, taking into account the facts and circumstances surrounding the alleged illegal act, as part of the Party’s “knowledge” requirements. A Party may treat “having reason to know” as meaning “wilful negligence”. 

141 With regard to the criminal offences and penalties in paragraph 1 and paragraph 3, a Party may require a demonstration of intent to avoid payment to the lawful distributor, or a demonstration of intent to otherwise secure a pecuniary benefit to which the recipient is not entitled. 

142 The obligation regarding export may be met by making it a criminal offence to possess and distribute a device or system described in this paragraph. For the purposes of this Article, a Party may provide that a “lawful distributor” means a person that has the lawful right in that Party’s territory to distribute the encrypted program-carrying signal and authorise its decoding. 

143 For greater certainty and for the purposes of paragraph 1(b) and paragraph 3(b), a Party may provide that wilful receipt of an encrypted program-carrying satellite or cable signal means receipt and use of the signal, or means receipt and decoding of the signal. 

144 For greater certainty, a Party may interpret “further distribute” as “retransmit to the public”. 


2. Each Party shall provide for civil remedies for a person that holds an interest in an encrypted program-carrying satellite signal or its content and that is injured by an activity described in paragraph 1. 


3. Each Party shall provide for criminal penalties or civil remedies145 for wilfully: 


(a) 	manufacturing or distributing equipment knowing that the equipment is intended to be used in the unauthorised reception of any encrypted program-carrying cable signal; and 


(b) 	receiving, or assisting another to receive,146 an encrypted program-carrying cable signal without authorisation of the lawful distributor of the signal.</article>
      <article number="ARTICLE 18.80" name="Government Use Of Software" article_identifier="40353">1. Each Party recognises the importance of promoting the adoption of measures to enhance government awareness of respect for intellectual property rights and of the detrimental effects of the infringement of intellectual property rights. 


2. Each Party shall adopt or maintain appropriate laws, regulations, policies, orders, government-issued guidelines, or administrative or executive decrees that provide that its central government agencies use only non-infringing computer software protected by copyright and related rights, and, if applicable, only use that computer software in a manner authorised by the relevant licence. These measures shall apply to the acquisition and management of the software for 
147 

government use. 

145 If a Party provides for civil remedies, it may require a demonstration of injury. 

146 A Party may comply with its obligation in respect of “assisting another to receive” by providing for criminal penalties to be available against a person wilfully publishing any information in order to enable or assist another person to receive a signal without authorisation of the lawful distributor of the signal. 

147 For greater certainty, paragraph 2 should not be interpreted as encouraging regional government agencies to use infringing computer software or, if applicable, to use computer software in a manner which is not authorised by the relevant licence.

      <article number="ARTICLE 18.81" name="Definitions" article_identifier="40354">For the purposes of this Section: 

the term copyright includes related rights; and 
Internet Service Provider means: 


(a) 	a provider of online services for the transmission, routing, or providing of connections for digital online communications, between or among points specified by a user, of material of the user’s choosing, undertaking the function in Article 18.82.2(a) (Legal Remedies and Safe Harbours); or 


(b) 	a provider of online services undertaking the functions in Article 18.82.2(c) or Article 18.82.2(d) (Legal Remedies and Safe Harbours). 
For greater certainty, Internet Service Provider includes a provider of the services listed above that engages in caching carried out through an automated process.</article>
      <article number="ARTICLE 18.82" name="Legal Remedies And Safe Harbours" article_identifier="40355">1. The Parties recognise the importance of facilitating the continued development of legitimate online services operating as intermediaries and, in a manner consistent with Article 41 of the TRIPS Agreement, providing enforcement procedures that permit effective action by right holders against copyright infringement covered under this Chapter that occurs in the online environment. Accordingly, each Party shall ensure that legal remedies are available for right holders to address such copyright infringement and shall establish or maintain appropriate safe harbours in respect of online services that are Internet Service Providers. This framework of legal remedies and safe harbours shall include: 

(a) 	legal incentives150 for Internet Service Providers to cooperate with copyright owners to deter the unauthorised storage and transmission of copyrighted materials or, in the alternative, to take 

148 	Annex 18-F applies to this Section. 

149 	Annex 18-E applies to Article 18.82.3 and Article 18.82.4 (Legal Remedies and Safe Harbours). 

150 For greater certainty, the Parties understand that implementation of the obligations in paragraph 1(a) on “legal incentives” may take different forms. 

other action to deter the unauthorised storage and transmission of copyrighted materials; and 

(b) 	limitations in its law that have the effect of precluding monetary relief against Internet Service Providers for copyright infringements that they do not control, initiate or direct, and that take place through systems or networks controlled or operated by them or on their behalf.151 

2. The limitations described in paragraph 1(b) shall include limitations in respect of the following functions: 


(a) 	transmitting, routing or providing connections for material without modification of its content 152 or the intermediate and transient storage of that material done automatically in the course of such a technical process; 


(b) 	caching carried out through an automated process; 


(c) 	storage 153, at the direction of a user, of material residing on a system or network controlled or operated by or for the Internet Service Provider;154 and 


(d) 	referring or linking users to an online location by using information location tools, including hyperlinks and directories. 
3. To facilitate effective action to address infringement, each Party shall prescribe in its law conditions for Internet Service Providers to qualify for the limitations described in paragraph 1(b), or, alternatively, shall provide for circumstances under which Internet Service Providers do not qualify for the 

155, 156

limitations described in paragraph 1(b):

151 The Parties understand that, to the extent that a Party determines, consistent with its international legal obligations, that a particular act does not constitute copyright infringement, there is no obligation to provide for a limitation in relation to that act. 

152 The Parties understand that such modification does not include a modification made as part of a technical process or for solely technical reasons such as division into packets. 

153 For greater certainty, a Party may interpret “storage” as “hosting”. 

154 For greater certainty, the storage of material may include e-mails and their attachments stored in the Internet Service Provider’s server and web pages residing on the Internet Service Provider’s server. 

155 A Party may comply with the obligations in paragraph 3 by maintaining a framework in which: 


(a) 	there is a stakeholder organisation that includes representatives of both Internet Service Providers and right holders, established with government involvement; 


(a) 	With respect to the functions referred to in paragraph 2(c) and paragraph 2(d), these conditions shall include a requirement for Internet Service Providers to expeditiously remove or disable access to material residing on their networks or systems upon obtaining actual knowledge of the copyright infringement or becoming aware of facts or circumstances from which the infringement is apparent, such as through receiving a notice157 of alleged infringement from the right holder or a person authorised to act on its behalf, 


(b) 	An Internet Service Provider that removes or disables access to material in good faith under subparagraph (a) shall be exempt from any liability for having done so, provided that it takes reasonable steps in advance or promptly after to notify the person whose material is removed or disabled.158 

(b) 	that stakeholder organisation develops and maintains effective, efficient and timely procedures for entities certified by the stakeholder organisation to verify, without undue delay, the validity of each notice of alleged copyright infringement by confirming that the notice is not the result of mistake or misidentification, before forwarding the verified notice to the relevant Internet Service Provider; 


(c) 	there are appropriate guidelines for Internet Service Providers to follow in order to qualify for the limitation described in paragraph 1(b), including requiring that the Internet Service Provider promptly removes or disables access to the identified materials upon receipt of a verified notice; and be exempted from liability for having done so in good faith in accordance with those guidelines; and 


(d) 	there are appropriate measures that provide for liability in cases in which an Internet Service Provider has actual knowledge of the infringement or awareness of facts or circumstances from which the infringement is apparent. 
156 The Parties understand that a Party that has yet to implement the obligations in paragraphs 3 and 4 will do so in a manner that is both effective and consistent with that Party’s existing constitutional provisions. To that end, a Party may establish an appropriate role for the government that does not impair the timeliness of the process provided in paragraphs 3 and 4, and does not entail advance government review of each individual notice. 

157 For greater certainty, a notice of alleged infringement, as may be set out under a Party’s law, must contain information that: 


(a) 	is reasonably sufficient to enable the Internet Service Provider to identify the work, performance or phonogram claimed to be infringed, the alleged infringing material, and the online location of the alleged infringement; and 


(b) 	has a sufficient indicia of reliability with respect to the authority of the person sending the notice. 
158 With respect to the function in subparagraph 2(b), a Party may limit the requirements of paragraph 3 related to an Internet Service Provider removing or disabling access to material to circumstances in which the Internet Service Provider becomes aware or receives notification that the cached material has been removed or access to it has been disabled at the originating site. 


4. If a system for counter-notices is provided under a Party’s law, and if material has been removed or access has been disabled in accordance with paragraph 3, that Party shall require that the Internet Service Provider restores the material subject to a counter-notice, unless the person giving the original notice seeks judicial relief within a reasonable period of time. 


5. Each Party shall ensure that monetary remedies are available in its legal system against any person that makes a knowing material misrepresentation in a notice or counter-notice that causes injury to any interested party159 as a result of an Internet Service Provider relying on the misrepresentation. 


6. Eligibility for the limitations in paragraph 1 shall not be conditioned on the Internet Service Provider monitoring its service or affirmatively seeking facts indicating infringing activity. 


7. Each Party shall provide procedures, whether judicial or administrative, in accordance with that Party’s legal system, and consistent with principles of due process and privacy, that enable a copyright owner that has made a legally sufficient claim of copyright infringement to obtain expeditiously from an Internet 

Service Provider information in the provider’s possession identifying the alleged infringer, in cases in which that information is sought for the purpose of protecting or enforcing that copyright. 

8. The Parties understand that the failure of an Internet Service Provider to qualify for the limitations in paragraph 1(b) does not itself result in liability. Further, this Article is without prejudice to the availability of other limitations and exceptions to copyright, or any other defences under a Party’s legal system. 


9. The Parties recognise the importance, in implementing their obligations under this Article, of taking into account the impacts on right holders and Internet Service Providers.</article>

Viet Nam’s request shall include the reason for the request. The Commission shall decide pursuant to the procedures set forth in Article 27.3 (Decision-Making), whether to grant the request based on relevant factors, which may include capacity as well as other appropriate circumstances. Viet Nam shall make the request no later than one year prior to the expiration of the two-year transition period referred to in the first sentence of paragraph (A). The Parties shall give due consideration to that request.

To that end, Viet Nam shall notify the other Parties through the Commission and consult with them on such a proposed measure. Such consultations shall begin within 30 days of a request from an interested Party, and shall provide adequate time and opportunity to resolve any concerns. In addition, any such measure shall respect legitimate commercial considerations and take into account the need for incentives for the development of new pharmaceutical products and for the expeditious marketing approval in Viet Nam of such products.</article>

      <article number="ARTICLE 20.16" name="Marine Capture Fisheries" article_identifier="40387">1. The Parties acknowledge their role as major consumers, producers and traders of fisheries products and the importance of the marine fisheries sector to their development and to the livelihoods of their fishing communities, including artisanal or small-scale fisheries. The Parties also acknowledge that the fate of marine capture fisheries is an urgent resource problem facing the international community. Accordingly, the Parties recognise the importance of taking measures aimed at the conservation and the sustainable management of fisheries. 


2. In this regard, the Parties acknowledge that inadequate fisheries management, fisheries subsidies that contribute to overfishing and overcapacity, and illegal, unreported and unregulated (IUU) fishing11 can have significant negative impacts on trade, development and the environment and recognise the need for individual and collective action to address the problems of overfishing and unsustainable utilisation of fisheries resources. 


3. Accordingly, each Party shall seek to operate a fisheries management system that regulates marine wild capture fishing and that is designed to: 


(a) 	prevent overfishing and overcapacity; 


(b) 	reduce bycatch of non-target species and juveniles, including through the regulation of fishing gear that results in bycatch and the regulation of fishing in areas where bycatch is likely to occur; and 


(c) 	promote the recovery of overfished stocks for all marine fisheries in which that Party’s persons conduct fishing activities. 
10 For greater certainty, this Article does not apply with respect to aquaculture. 

Such a management system shall be based on the best scientific evidence available and on internationally recognised best practices for fisheries management and conservation as reflected in the relevant provisions of international instruments aimed at ensuring the sustainable use and conservation of marine species.12 

4. Each Party shall promote the long-term conservation of sharks, marine turtles, seabirds, and marine mammals, through the implementation and effective enforcement of conservation and management measures. Such measures should include, as appropriate: 

(a) 	for sharks: the collection of species specific data, fisheries bycatch mitigation measures, catch limits, and finning prohibitions; and 

11 The term “illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing” is to be understood to have the same meaning as paragraph 3 of the International Plan of Action to Prevent, Deter and Eliminate Illegal, Unreported and Unregulated Fishing (2001 IUU Fishing Plan of Action) of the UN Food and Agricultural Organisation (FAO), adopted in Rome, 2001. 

12 These instruments include, among others, and as they may apply, UNCLOS, the United Nations Agreement for the Implementation of the Provisions of the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea of December 1982 relating to the Conservation and Management of Straddling Fish Stocks and Highly Migratory Fish Stocks, done at New York, December 4, 1995 (UN Fish Stocks Agreement), the FAO Code of Conduct for Responsible Fisheries, the 1993 FAO Agreement to Promote Compliance with International Conservation and Management Measures by Fishing Vessels on the High Seas, (Compliance Agreement) done at Rome, November 24, 1993 and the 2001 IUU Fishing Plan of Action. 

(b) 	for marine turtles, seabirds, and marine mammals: fisheries bycatch mitigation measures, conservation and relevant management measures, prohibitions, and other measures in accordance with relevant international agreements to which the Party is party. 

5. The Parties recognise that the implementation of a fisheries management system that is designed to prevent overfishing and overcapacity and to promote the recovery of overfished stocks must include the control, reduction and eventual elimination of all subsidies that contribute to overfishing and overcapacity. To that end, no Party shall grant or maintain any of the following subsidies13 within the meaning of Article 1.1 of the SCM Agreement that are specific within the meaning of Article 2 of the SCM Agreement: 


(a) 	subsidies for fishingthat negatively affectfish stocks that are in an overfished16 condition; and 


(b) 	subsidies provided to any fishing vessel17 while listed by the flag State or a relevant Regional Fisheries Management Organisation or Arrangement for IUU fishing in accordance with the rules and procedures of that organisation or arrangement and in conformity with international law. 
6. Subsidy programmes that are established by a Party before the date of entry into force of this Agreement for that Party and which are inconsistent with paragraph 5(a) shall be brought into conformity with that paragraph as soon as 

13 For the purposes of this Article, a subsidy shall be attributable to the Party conferring it, regardless of the flag of the vessel involved or the application of rules of origin to the fish involved. 

14 For the purposes of this paragraph, “fishing” means searching for, attracting, locating, catching, taking or harvesting fish or any activity which can reasonably be expected to result in the attracting, locating, catching, taking or harvesting of fish. 

15 The negative effect of such subsidies shall be determined based on the best scientific evidence available. 

16 For the purposes of this Article, a fish stock is overfished if the stock is at such a low level that mortality from fishing needs to be restricted to allow the stock to rebuild to a level that produces maximum sustainable yield or alternative reference points based on the best scientific evidence available. Fish stocks that are recognised as overfished by the national jurisdiction where the fishing is taking place or by a relevant Regional Fisheries Management Organisation shall also be considered overfished for the purposes of this paragraph. 

17 The term “fishing vessels” refers to any vessel, ship or other type of boat used for, equipped to be used for, or intended to be used for fishing or fishing related activities.

7. In relation to subsidies that are not prohibited by paragraph 5(a) or 5(b), and taking into consideration a Party’s social and developmental priorities, including food security concerns, each Party shall make best efforts to refrain from introducing new, or extending or enhancing existing, subsidies within the meaning of Article 1.1 of the SCM Agreement, to the extent they are specific within the meaning of Article 2 of the SCM Agreement, that contribute to overfishing or overcapacity. 


8. With a view to achieving the objective of eliminating subsidies that contribute to overfishing and overcapacity, the Parties shall review the disciplines in paragraph 5 at regular meetings of the Committee. 


9. Each Party shall notify the other Parties, within one year of the date of entry into force of this Agreement for it and every two years thereafter, of any subsidy within the meaning of Article 1.1 of the SCM Agreement that is specific within the meaning of Article 2 of the SCM Agreement, that the Party grants or maintains to persons engaged in fishing or fishing related activities. 


10. These notifications shall cover subsidies provided within the previous two-year period and shall include the information required under Article 25.3 of the SCM Agreement and, to the extent possible, the following information:19 


(a) 	programme name; 


(b) 	legal authority for the programme; 


(c) 	catch data by species in the fishery for which the subsidy is provided; 
18 Notwithstanding this paragraph, and solely for the purpose of completing a stock assessment that it has already initiated, Viet Nam may request an extension of two additional years to bring any subsidy programmes into conformity with Article 20.16.5(a) (Marine Capture Fisheries) by providing a written request to the Committee no later than six months before the expiry of the three-year period provided for in this paragraph. Viet Nam’s request shall include the reason for the requested extension and the information about its subsidy programmes as provided for in Article 20.16.10. Viet Nam may avail itself of this one-time extension upon providing a request in accordance with this footnote unless the Committee decides otherwise within 60 days of receiving the request. No later than the date on which the additional two-year period expires, Viet Nam shall provide to the Committee in writing a report on the measures it has taken to fulfil its obligation under Article 20.16.5(a). 

19 Sharing information and data on existing fisheries subsidy programmes does not prejudge their legal status, effects or nature under the GATT 1994 or the SCM Agreement and is intended to complement WTO data reporting requirements. 


(d) 	status of the fish stocks in the fishery for which the subsidy is provided (for example, overexploited, depleted, fully exploited, recovering or underexploited); 


(e) 	fleet capacity in the fishery for which the subsidy is provided; 


(f) 	conservation and management measures in place for the relevant fish stock; and 


(g) 	total imports and exports per species. 

11. Each Party shall also provide, to the extent possible, information in relation to other fisheries subsidies that the Party grants or maintains that are not covered by paragraph 5, in particular fuel subsidies. 


12. A Party may request additional information from the notifying Party regarding the notifications under paragraphs 9 and 10. The notifying Party shall respond to that request as quickly as possible and in a comprehensive manner. 


13. The Parties recognise the importance of concerted international action to address IUU fishing as reflected in regional and international instruments20 and shall endeavour to improve cooperation internationally in this regard, including with and through competent international organisations. 


14. In support of efforts to combat IUU fishing practices and to help deter trade in products from species harvested from those practices, each Party shall: 


(a) 	cooperate with other Parties to identify needs and to build capacity to support the implementation of this Article; 


(b) 	support monitoring, control, surveillance, compliance and enforcement systems, including by adopting, reviewing, or revising, as appropriate measures to: 


(i) 	deter vessels that are flying its flag and its nationals from engaging in IUU fishing activities; and 


(ii) 	address the transhipment at sea of fish or fish products caught through IUU fishing activities; 
20 Regional and international instruments include, among others, and as they may apply, the 2001 IUU Fishing Plan of Action, the 2005 Rome Declaration on IUU Fishing, adopted in Rome on March 12, 2005, the Agreement on Port State Measures to Prevent, Deter and Eliminate Illegal, Unreported and Unregulated Fishing, done at Rome, November 22, 2009, as well as instruments establishing and adopted by Regional Fisheries Management Organisations, which are defined as intergovernmental fisheries organisations or arrangements, as appropriate, that have the competence to establish conservation and management measures. 


(c) 	implement port State measures; 


(d) 	strive to act consistently with relevant conservation and management measures adopted by Regional Fisheries Management Organisations of which it is not a member so as not to undermine those measures; and 


(e) 	endeavour not to undermine catch or trade documentation schemes operated by Regional Fisheries Management Organisations or Arrangements or an intergovernmental organisation whose scope includes the management of shared fisheries resources, including straddling and highly migratory species, where that Party is not a member of those organisations or arrangements. 
15. Consistent with Article 26.2.2 (Publication), a Party shall, to the extent possible, provide other Parties the opportunity to comment on proposed measures that are designed to prevent trade in fisheries products that results from IUU fishing.</article>
      <article number="ARTICLE 20.17" name="Conservation And Trade" article_identifier="40388">1. The Parties affirm the importance of combating the illegal take21 of, and illegal trade in, wild fauna and flora, and acknowledge that this trade undermines efforts to conserve and sustainably manage those natural resources, has social consequences, distorts legal trade in wild fauna and flora, and reduces the economic and environmental value of these natural resources. 


2. Accordingly, each Party shall adopt, maintain and implement laws, regulations and any other measures to fulfil its obligations under the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora 
22, 23, 24 

(CITES).

21 The term “take” means captured, killed or collected and with respect to a plant, also means harvested, cut, logged or removed. 

22 For the purposes of this Article, a Party’s CITES obligations include existing and future amendments to which it is a Party and any existing and future reservations, exemptions, and exceptions applicable to it. 

23 To establish a violation of this paragraph, a Party must demonstrate that the other Party has failed to adopt, maintain or implement laws, regulations or other measures to fulfil its obligations under CITES in a manner affecting trade or investment between the Parties. 

24 If a Party considers that another Party is failing to comply with its obligations under this paragraph, it shall endeavour, in the first instance, to address the matter through a consultative or other procedure under CITES. 

3. The Parties commit to promote conservation and to combat the illegal take of, and illegal trade in, wild fauna and flora. To that end, the Parties shall:

      <article number="ARTICLE 25.1" name="Definitions" article_identifier="40418">For the purposes of this Chapter: 

covered regulatory measure means the regulatory measure determined by each Party to be subject to this Chapter in accordance with Article 25.3 (Scope of Covered Regulatory Measures); and 

regulatory measure means a measure of general application related to any matter covered by this Agreement adopted by regulatory agencies with which compliance is mandatory.</article>
      <article number="ARTICLE 25.2" name="General Provisions" article_identifier="40419">1. For the purposes of this Chapter, regulatory coherence refers to the use of good regulatory practices in the process of planning, designing, issuing, implementing and reviewing regulatory measures in order to facilitate achievement of domestic policy objectives, and in efforts across governments to enhance regulatory cooperation in order to further those objectives and promote international trade and investment, economic growth and employment. 


2. 	The Parties affirm the importance of: 


(a) 	sustaining and enhancing the benefits of this Agreement through regulatory coherence in terms of facilitating increased trade in goods and services and increased investment between the Parties; 


(b) 	each Party’s sovereign right to identify its regulatory priorities and establish and implement regulatory measures to address these priorities, at the levels that the Party considers appropriate; 


(c) 	the role that regulation plays in achieving public policy objectives; 


(d) 	taking into account input from interested persons in the development of regulatory measures; and 


(e) 	developing regulatory cooperation and capacity building between the Parties.</article>

In determining the scope of covered regulatory measures, each Party should aim to achieve significant coverage.</article>
      <article number="ARTICLE 25.4" name="Coordination And Review Processes Or Mechanisms" article_identifier="40421">1. The Parties recognise that regulatory coherence can be facilitated through domestic mechanisms that increase interagency consultation and coordination associated with processes for developing regulatory measures. Accordingly, each Party shall endeavour to ensure that it has processes or mechanisms to facilitate the effective interagency coordination and review of proposed covered regulatory measures. Each Party should consider establishing and maintaining a national or central coordinating body for this purpose. 


2. The Parties recognise that while the processes or mechanisms referred to in paragraph 1 may vary between Parties depending on their respective circumstances (including differences in levels of development and political and institutional structures), they should generally have as overarching characteristics the ability to: 


(a) 	review proposed covered regulatory measures to determine the extent to which the development of such measures adheres to good regulatory practices, which may include but are not limited to those set out in Article 25.5 (Implementation of Core Good Regulatory Practices), and make recommendations based on that review; 


(b) 	strengthen consultation and coordination among domestic agencies so as to identify potential overlap and duplication and to prevent the creation of inconsistent requirements across agencies; 


(c) 	make recommendations for systemic regulatory improvements; and 


(d) 	publicly report on regulatory measures reviewed, any proposals for systemic regulatory improvements, and any updates on changes to the processes and mechanisms referred to in paragraph 1. 
Each Party should generally produce documents that include descriptions of those processes or mechanisms and that can be made available to the public.</article>
      <article number="ARTICLE 25.5" name="Implementation Of Core Good Regulatory Practices" article_identifier="40422">1. To assist in designing a measure to best achieve the Party’s objective, each Party should generally encourage relevant regulatory agencies, consistent with its laws and regulations, to conduct regulatory impact assessments when developing proposed covered regulatory measures that exceed a threshold of economic impact, or other regulatory impact, where appropriate, as established by the Party. Regulatory impact assessments may encompass a range of procedures to determine possible impacts. 


2. Recognising that differences in the Parties’ institutional, social, cultural, legal and developmental circumstances may result in specific regulatory approaches, regulatory impact assessments conducted by a Party should, among other things: 


(a) 	assess the need for a regulatory proposal, including a description of the nature and significance of the problem; 


(b) 	examine feasible alternatives, including, to the extent feasible and consistent with laws and regulations, their costs and benefits, such as risks involved as well as distributive impacts, recognising that some costs and benefits are difficult to quantify and monetise; 


(c) 	explain the grounds for concluding that the selected alternative achieves the policy objectives in an efficient manner, including, if appropriate, reference to the costs and benefits and the potential for managing risks; and 


(d) 	rely on the best reasonably obtainable existing information including relevant scientific, technical, economic or other information, within the boundaries of the authorities, mandates and resources of the particular regulatory agency. 

3. When conducting regulatory impact assessments, a Party may take into consideration the potential impact of the proposed regulation on SMEs. 


4. Each Party should ensure that new covered regulatory measures are plainly written and are clear, concise, well organised and easy to understand, recognising that some measures address technical issues and that relevant expertise may be needed to understand and apply them. 


5. Subject to its laws and regulations, each Party should ensure that relevant regulatory agencies provide public access to information on new covered regulatory measures and, where practicable, make this information available online. 


6. Each Party should review, at intervals it deems appropriate, its covered regulatory measures to determine whether specific regulatory measures it has implemented should be modified, streamlined, expanded or repealed so as to make the Party’s regulatory regime more effective in achieving the Party’s policy objectives. 


7. Each Party should, in a manner it deems appropriate, and consistent with its laws and regulations, provide annual public notice of any covered regulatory measure that it reasonably expects its regulatory agencies to issue within the following 12-month period. 


8. To the extent appropriate and consistent with its law, each Party should encourage its relevant regulatory agencies to consider regulatory measures in other Parties, as well as relevant developments in international, regional and other fora when planning covered regulatory measures.</article>

3. In identifying future priorities, the Committee shall take into account the activities of other committees, working groups and any other subsidiary body established under this Agreement and shall coordinate with them in order to avoid duplication of activities.

The Parties recognise the importance of prompt compliance with determinations made by panels under Article 28.18 (Final Report) in achieving the aim of the dispute settlement procedures in this Chapter, which is to secure a positive solution to disputes. 


2. 	If in its final report the panel determines that: 


(a) 	the measure at issue is inconsistent with a Party’s obligations in this Agreement; 


(b) 	a Party has otherwise failed to carry out its obligations in this Agreement; or 


(c) 	the measure at issue is causing nullification or impairment within the meaning of Article 28.3.1(c) (Scope),

      <article number="ARTICLE 28.20" name="Non-Implementation – Compensation And Suspension Of Benefits" article_identifier="40467">1. The responding Party shall, if requested by the complaining Party or Parties, enter into negotiations with the complaining Party or Parties no later than 15 days after receipt of that request, with a view to developing mutually acceptable compensation, if: 


(a) 	the responding Party has notified the complaining Party or Parties that it does not intend to eliminate the non-conformity or the nullification or impairment; or 


(b) 	following the expiry of the reasonable period of time established in accordance with Article 28.19 (Implementation of Final Report), there is disagreement between the disputing Parties as to whether the responding Party has eliminated the non-conformity or the nullification or impairment. 
2. A complaining Party may suspend benefits in accordance with paragraph 3 if that complaining Party and the responding Party have: 


(a) 	been unable to agree on compensation within a period of 30 days after the period for developing compensation has begun; or 


(b) 	agreed on compensation but the relevant complaining Party considers that the responding Party has failed to observe the terms of the agreement. 

3. A complaining Party may, at any time after the conditions set out in paragraph 2 are met in relation to that complaining Party, provide written notice to the responding Party that it intends to suspend benefits of equivalent effect. The notice shall specify the level of benefits that the Party proposes to suspend.3 The complaining Party may begin suspending benefits 30 days after the later of the date on which it provides notice under this paragraph or the date that the panel issues its determination under paragraph 5, as the case may be. 


4. In considering what benefits to suspend under paragraph 3, the complaining Party shall apply the following principles and procedures: 


(a) 	it should first seek to suspend benefits in the same subject matter as that in which the panel has determined non-conformity or nullification or impairment to exist; 


(b) 	if it considers that it is not practicable or effective to suspend benefits in the same subject matter, and that the circumstances are serious enough, it may suspend benefits in a different subject matter. In the written notice referred to in paragraph 3, the complaining Party shall indicate the reasons on which its decision to suspend benefits in a different subject matter is based; and 


(c) 	in applying the principles set out in subparagraphs (a) and (b), it shall take into account: 


(i) 	the trade in the good, the supply of the service or other subject matter in which the panel has found the nonconformity or nullification or impairment, and the importance of that trade to the complaining Party; 


(ii) 	that goods, all financial services covered under Chapter 11 (Financial Services), services other than such financial services, and each section in Chapter 18 (Intellectual Property), are each distinct subject matters; and 
(iii) 	the broader economic elements related to the nullification or impairment and the broader economic consequences of the suspension of benefits. 

5. 	If the responding Party considers that: 
3 For greater certainty, the phrase “the level of benefits that the Party proposes to suspend” refers 

to the level of concessions under this Agreement, the suspension of which a complaining Party considers will have an effect equivalent to that of the non-conformity, or nullification or impairment in the sense of Article 28.3.1(c) (Scope), determined to exist by the panel in its final report issued under Article 28.18.1 (Final Report). 


(a) 	the level of benefits proposed to be suspended is manifestly excessive or the complaining Party has failed to follow the principles and procedures set out in paragraph 4; or 


(b) 	it has eliminated the non-conformity or the nullification or impairment that the panel has determined to exist, 
it may, within 30 days of the date of delivery of the written notice provided by the complaining Party under paragraph 3, request that the panel be reconvened to consider the matter. The responding Party shall deliver its request in writing to the complaining Party. The panel shall reconvene as soon as possible after the date of delivery of the request and shall present its determination to the disputing Parties no later than 90 days after it reconvenes to review a request under subparagraph (a) or (b), or 120 days after it reconvenes for a request under both subparagraphs (a) and (b). If the panel determines that the level of benefits the complaining Party proposes to suspend is manifestly excessive, it shall determine the level of benefits it considers to be of equivalent effect. 

6. Unless the panel has determined that the responding Party has eliminated the non-conformity or the nullification or impairment, the complaining Party may suspend benefits up to the level the panel has determined under paragraph 5 or, if the panel has not determined the level, the level the complaining Party has proposed to suspend under paragraph 3. If the panel determines that the complaining Party has not followed the principles and procedures set out in paragraph 4, the panel shall set out in its determination the extent to which the complaining Party may suspend benefits in which subject matter in order to ensure full compliance with the principles and procedures set out in paragraph 4. The complaining Party may suspend benefits only in a manner consistent with the 

panel’s determination. 


7. The complaining Party shall not suspend benefits if, within 30 days after it provides written notice of intent to suspend benefits or, if the panel is reconvened under paragraph 5, within 20 days after the panel provides its determination, the responding Party provides written notice to the complaining Party that it will pay a monetary assessment. The disputing Parties shall begin consultations no later than 10 days after the date on which the responding Party has given notice that it intends to pay a monetary assessment, with a view to reaching agreement on the amount of the assessment. If the disputing Parties are unable to reach an agreement within 30 days after consultations begin and are not engaged in discussions regarding the use of a fund under paragraph 8, the amount of the assessment shall be set at a level, in U.S. dollars, equal to 50 per cent of the level of the benefits the panel has determined under paragraph 5 to be of equivalent effect or, if the panel has not determined the level, 50 per cent of the level that the complaining Party has proposed to suspend under paragraph 3. 


8. 	If a monetary assessment is to be paid to the complaining Party, then it 

shall be paid in U.S. dollars, or in an equivalent amount of the currency of the responding Party or in another currency agreed to by the disputing Parties in equal, quarterly instalments beginning 60 days after the date on which the responding Party gives notice that it intends to pay an assessment. If the circumstances warrant, the disputing Parties may decide that the responding Party shall pay an assessment into a fund designated by the disputing Parties for appropriate initiatives to facilitate trade between the Parties, including by further reducing unreasonable trade barriers or by assisting the responding Party to carry out its obligations under this Agreement. 

9. At the same time as the payment of its first quarterly instalment is due, the responding Party shall provide to the complaining Party a plan of the steps it intends to take to eliminate the non-conformity or the nullification or impairment.  


10. A responding Party may pay a monetary assessment in lieu of suspension of benefits by the complaining Party for a maximum of 12 months from the date on which the responding Party has provided written notice under paragraph 7 unless the complaining Party agrees to an extension.  


11. A responding Party that seeks an extension of the period for the payment under paragraph 10 shall make a written request for that extension no later than 30 days before the expiration of the 12 month period. The disputing Parties shall determine the length and terms of any extension, including the amount of the assessment. 


12. The complaining Party may suspend the application to the responding Party of benefits in accordance with paragraphs 3, 4 and 6, if: 


(a) 	the responding Party fails to make a payment under paragraph 8 or fails to make the payment under paragraph 13 after electing to do so; 


(b) 	the responding Party fails to provide the plan as required under paragraph 9; or 


(c) 	the monetary assessment period, including any extension, has lapsed and the responding Party has not yet eliminated the nonconformity or the nullification or impairment. 

13. If the responding Party notified the complaining Party that it wished to discuss the possible use of a fund and the disputing Parties do not agree on the use of a fund within three months of the date of the responding Party’s notice under paragraph 7, and this time period has not been extended by agreement of the disputing Parties, the responding Party may elect to make the monetary assessment payment equal to 50 per cent of the amount determined under paragraph 5 or the level proposed by the complaining Party under paragraph 3 if there has been no determination under paragraph 5. If this election is made, the 
payment must be made within nine months of the responding Party’s notice under 

paragraph 7 in U.S. dollars, or in an equivalent amount of the currency of the responding Party or in another currency agreed to by the disputing Parties. If the election is not made, the complaining Party may suspend the application of benefits in the amount determined under paragraph 5, or the level proposed by the complaining Party under paragraph 3 if there has been no determination under paragraph 5, at the end of the election period. 


14. The complaining Party shall accord sympathetic consideration to the notice provided by the responding Party regarding the possible use of the fund referred to in paragraphs 8 and 13. 


15. Compensation, suspension of benefits and the payment of a monetary assessment shall be temporary measures. None of these measures is preferred to full implementation through elimination of the non-conformity or the nullification or impairment. Compensation, suspension of benefits and the payment of a monetary assessment shall only be applied until the responding Party has eliminated the non-conformity or the nullification or impairment, or until a mutually satisfactory solution is reached.</article>
      <article number="ARTICLE 28.21" name="Compliance Review" article_identifier="40468">1. Without prejudice to the procedures in Article 28.20 (Non-Implementation -Compensation and Suspension of Benefits), if a responding Party considers that it has eliminated the non-conformity or the nullification or impairment found by the panel, it may refer the matter to the panel by providing a written notice to the complaining Party or Parties. The panel shall issue its report on the matter no later than 90 days after the responding Party provides written notice. 


2. If the panel determines that the responding Party has eliminated the nonconformity or the nullification or impairment, the complaining Party or Parties shall promptly reinstate any benefits suspended under Article 28.20 (Non-Implementation -Compensation and Suspension of Benefits).

(b) 	Article 9.4 (National Treatment), Article 9.5 (Most-Favoured-Nation Treatment), Article 10.3 (National Treatment), Article 10.4 (Most-Favoured-Nation Treatment), Article 11.3 (National Treatment), Article 11.4 (Most-Favoured-Nation Treatment), Article 11.6.1 (Cross-Border Trade) and Article 14.4 (Non-Discriminatory Treatment of Digital Products) shall apply to all taxation measures, other than those on income, on capital gains, on the taxable capital of corporations, on the value of an investment or property 9 (but not on the transfer of that investment or property), or taxes on estates, inheritances, gifts and generation-skipping transfers; and 


(c) 	Article 14.4 (Non-Discriminatory Treatment of Digital Products) shall apply to taxation measures on income, on capital gains, on the taxable income of corporations, or on the value of an investment or property 9 (but not on the transfer of that investment or property), that relate to the purchase or consumption of particular digital products, except that nothing in this subparagraph shall prevent a Party from conditioning the receipt or continued receipt of an advantage relating to the purchase or consumption of particular digital products on requirements to provide the digital product in its territory, 
but nothing in the Articles referred to in subparagraphs (a), (b) and (c) shall apply to: 


(d) 	any most-favoured-nation obligation with respect to an advantage accorded by a Party pursuant to a tax convention; 


(e) 	a non-conforming provision of any existing taxation measure; 


(f) 	the continuation or prompt renewal of a non-conforming provision of any existing taxation measure; 
9 This is without prejudice to the methodology used to determine the value of such investment or 

property under Parties’ respective laws. 


(g) 	an amendment to a non-conforming provision of any existing taxation measure to the extent that the amendment does not decrease its conformity, at the time of the amendment, with any of those Articles; 


(h) 	the adoption or enforcement of any new taxation measure aimed at ensuring the equitable or effective imposition or collection of taxes, including any taxation measure that differentiates between persons based on their place of residence for tax purposes, provided that the taxation measure does not arbitrarily discriminate between persons, goods or services of the Parties;10 


(i) 	a provision that conditions the receipt or continued receipt of an advantage relating to the contributions to, or income of, a pension trust, pension plan, superannuation fund or other arrangement to provide pension, superannuation or similar benefits, on a requirement that the Party maintain continuous jurisdiction, regulation or supervision over that trust, plan, fund or other arrangement; or 


(j) 	any excise duty on insurance premiums to the extent that such tax would, if levied by the other Parties, be covered by subparagraph (e), (f) or (g). 

7. Subject to paragraph 3, and without prejudice to the rights and obligations of the Parties under paragraph 5, Article 9.10.2 (Performance Requirements), Article 9.10.3 and Article 9.10.5 shall apply to taxation measures. 


8. Article 9.8 (Expropriation and Compensation) shall apply to taxation measures. However, no investor may invoke Article 9.8 (Expropriation and Compensation) as the basis for a claim if it has been determined pursuant to this paragraph that the measure is not an expropriation. An investor that seeks to invoke Article 9.8 (Expropriation and Compensation) with respect to a taxation measure must first refer to the designated authorities of the Party of the investor and the respondent Party, at the time that it gives its notice of intent under Article 
9.19 (Submission of a Claim to Arbitration), the issue of whether that taxation measure is not an expropriation. If the designated authorities do not agree to consider the issue or, having agreed to consider it, fail to agree that the measure is not an expropriation within a period of six months of the referral, the investor may submit its claim to arbitration under Article 9.19 (Submission of a Claim to Arbitration). 

10 The Parties understand that this subparagraph must be interpreted by reference to the footnote to Article XIV(d) of GATS as if the Article was not restricted to services or direct taxes. 

9. Nothing in this Agreement shall prevent Singapore from adopting taxation measures no more trade restrictive than necessary to address Singapore’s public policy objectives arising out of its specific constraints of space.

      <article number="ARTICLE 29.5" name="Tobacco Control Measures" article_identifier="40475">A Party may elect to deny the benefits of Section B of Chapter 9 (Investment) with respect to claims challenging a tobacco control measure12 of the Party. Such a claim shall not be submitted to arbitration under Section B of Chapter 9 (Investment) if a Party has made such an election. If a Party has not elected to deny benefits with respect to such claims by the time of the submission of such a claim to arbitration under Section B of Chapter 9 (Investment), a Party may elect to deny benefits during the proceedings. For greater certainty, if a Party elects to deny benefits with respect to such claims, any such claim shall be dismissed.</article>
      <article number="ARTICLE 29.6" name="Treaty Of Waitangi" article_identifier="40476">1. Provided that such measures are not used as a means of arbitrary or unjustified discrimination against persons of the other Parties or as a disguised restriction on trade in goods, trade in services and investment, nothing in this Agreement shall preclude the adoption by New Zealand of measures it deems necessary to accord more favourable treatment to Maori in respect of matters covered by this Agreement, including in fulfilment of its obligations under the Treaty of Waitangi. 


2. The Parties agree that the interpretation of the Treaty of Waitangi, including as to the nature of the rights and obligations arising under it, shall not be subject to the dispute settlement provisions of this Agreement. Chapter 28 (Dispute Settlement) shall otherwise apply to this Article. A panel established under Article 28.7 (Establishment of a Panel) may be requested to determine only whether any measure referred to in paragraph 1 is inconsistent with a Party’s rights under this Agreement. 
11 For greater certainty, this Article does not prejudice: (i) the operation of Article 9.15 (Denial of Benefits); or (ii) a Party’s rights under Chapter 28 (Dispute Settlement) in relation to a tobacco control measure. 

12 A tobacco control measure means a measure of a Party related to the production or consumption of manufactured tobacco products (including products made or derived from tobacco), their distribution, labelling, packaging, advertising, marketing, promotion, sale, purchase, or use, as well as enforcement measures, such as inspection, recordkeeping, and reporting requirements. For greater certainty, a measure with respect to tobacco leaf that is not in the possession of a manufacturer of tobacco products or that is not part of a manufactured tobacco product is not a tobacco control measure.</article>
      <article number="ARTICLE 29.7" name="Disclosure Of Information" article_identifier="40477">Nothing in this Agreement shall be construed to require a Party to furnish or allow access to information, the disclosure of which would be contrary to its law or would impede law enforcement, or otherwise be contrary to the public interest, or which would prejudice the legitimate commercial interests of particular enterprises, public or private.</article>
      <article number="ARTICLE 29.8" name="Traditional Knowledge And Traditional Cultural Expressions" article_identifier="40478">Subject to each Party’s international obligations, each Party may establish appropriate measures to respect, preserve and promote traditional knowledge and traditional cultural expressions.</article>
