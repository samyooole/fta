      <article number="ARTICLE 2" article_identifier="18388">1. The aim of this Agreement of Association is to promote the continuous and balanced strengthening of trade and economic relations between the Parties, while taking full account of the need to ensure an accelerated development of the Greek economy and to improve the level of employment and the living conditions of the Greek people.
2. In order to attain the objectives set out in paragraph 1, the Association shall entail, as provided in this Agreement and in accordance with the timetable set out therein: '
(a) the establishment of a customs union;
(b) the promotion of joint measures by the Parties and harmonization of their policies in the fields men- tioned in this Agreement;
(c) the making available to the Greek economy, within the framework of the Financial Protocol to this Agreement, of resources which will assist it to develop at a higher rate.</article>
      <article number="ARTICLE 3" article_identifier="18389">To ensure the implementation and progressive de- velopment of the Association, the Contracting Parties shall meet in a Council of Association, which shall act within the powers conferred upon it by this Agreement.</article>
      <article number="ARTICLE 4" article_identifier="18390">The Contracting Parties shall take all appropriate mea- sures, whether general or particular, to ensure the ful- filment of the obligations arising out of this Agreement.
hey shall refrain from any measure which could jeopardize the attainment of the objectives of this Agreement.</article>
      <article number="ARTICLE 5" article_identifier="18391">1. Within the field of application of this Agreement and without prejudice to any special provisions contained therein, the Contracting Parties shall not practise or tolerate any discrimination on grounds of nationality to the prejudice of natural persons who are nationals of one of the Contracting Parties and are established in the territory of another Contracting Party. 

2. Companies or firms formed under the law of a Member State of the Community or of Greece and having their registered office, central administration or principal place of business in the territory of one of the Contracting Parties shall, for the purposes of paragraph 1; be treated as natural persons. 

Companies or firms means companies or firms constituted under civil or commercial law, including cooperative societies, and other legal persons governed by public or private law, save for those which are nonprofit-making. 

3. The Council of Association shall, where necessary, take the appropriate decisions to bring to an end the discrimination referred to in this Article.

FREE MOVEMENT OF GOODS</article>
      <article number="ARTICLE 6" article_identifier="18392">The Association shall be based upon a customs union which, save as otherwise provided in this Agreement, shall cover all trade in goods and which shall involve the prohibition between Member States of the Community and Greece of customs duties on imports and exports and of all charges having equivalent effect, and the adoption by Greece of the Common Customs Tariff of the Community in its relations with third countries. 

Save as otherwise provided in this Agreement, the transitional period for attainment of the customs union shall be 12 years.</article>
      <article number="ARTICLE 7" article_identifier="18393">1. Chapter I, Section I, and Chapter II of this Title shall apply: 


(a) 	to goods produced in Member States of the Community or in Greece, including those wholly or partially obtained or produced from products coming from third countries which are in free circulation in Member States or in Greece; 


(b) 	to goods coming from third countries which are in free circulation in Member States or in Greece. 
2. Products coming from third countries shall be considered to be in free circulation in Member States or in Greece if the import formalities have been complied with and any customs duties or charges having equivalent effect which are payable have been levied in the Member States or in Greece, and if they have not benefited from a total or partial drawback of such duties or charges.</article>
      <article number="ARTICLE 8" article_identifier="18394">1. Chapter I, Section I, and Chapter II of this Title shall likewise apply to goods obtained or produced in the Member States of the Community or in Greece, in the manufacture of which were used products coming from third countries and not in free circulation either .. in the Community or in Greece. These .provisions shall, however, apply to those goods only if the exporting State charges a levy, the rate of which is a percentage of the duties laid down in the Common Customs Tariff for third country products used in their manufacture. This percentage, fixed by the Council of Association for each of such periods as it may determine, shall be based on the tariff reduction granted on the goods in the importing State. The Council of Association shall also lay down the rules for the levy, taking into account the relevant rules in force in trade between Member States. 


2. Should the rules in question be amended in the trade between the Member States, the Council of Association would determine the new provisions applicable between the Contracting Parties.</article>
      <article number="ARTICLE 9" article_identifier="18395">The Contracting Parties shall determine the methods of administrative cooperation to be used in implementing Articles 7 and 8, taking into account the methods laid down by the Community with regard to trade between Member States.</article>
      <article number="ARTICLE 10" article_identifier="18396">1. Ifeither Contracting Party considers that differences arising from the application to imports of customs duties, quantitative restrictions or any measures having equivalent effect, or from any other measure of commercial policy, threaten to deflect trade or to cause economic difficulties in its territory, it shall bring the matter before the Council of Association, which may, if necessary, recommend appropriate methods for avoiding any harm liable to result therefrom. 


2. Where deflections occur or economic difficulties arise and the Party concerned considers that they call for immediate action, that Party may itself take the necessary protective measures, and shall notify the Council of Association thereof without delay; the Council of Association may decide whether the Party concerned shall amend or abolish those measures. 


3. In the choice of such measures preference shall be given to those which least disturb the operation of this Agreement and the normal development of trade. 


4. Before the end of the first year after the entry into fon;e of this Agreement, however, each Contracting Party may draw up a list of goods which fall within the category mentioned in Article 7 ( 1) (b) and in relation to which it considers that, by reason of disparities in customs duties, deflection of trade is likely to occur, so that it cannot immediately apply Chapter I, Section I or Chapter II of this Title. These lists shall be forwarded to the Council of Association which shall review them periodically with a view to their progressive abolition.</article>
      <article number="ARTICLE 11" article_identifier="18397">During the transitional period laid down in Article 6, the Contracting Parties shall, in so far as may be necessary for the proper functioning of the Association, take steps to approximate their provisions laid down by law, regulation or administrative action in respect of customs matters, taking into account the approximations already effected by Member States of the Community.</article>
    </chapter>
    <chapter number="CHAPTER I" name="The Customs Union" chapter_identifier="2211">
      <article number="ARTICLE 12" article_identifier="18398">The Contracting Parties shall refrain from introducing between themselves any new customs duties on imports or exports or any charges having equivalent effect, and from increasing those whic!i they already apply in their trade with each other at the date of entry into force of this Agreement.</article>
      <article number="ARTICLE 13" article_identifier="18399">Customs duties on imports and charges having equivalent effect in force between Member State~ of the Community and Greece shall be progressively abolished in accordance with Articles 14 and 15.</article>
      <article number="ARTICLE 14" article_identifier="18400">1. For each product, the basic duty on which Member States of the Community are to apply the successive reductions shall be the duty applied on 1 January 1957, in conformity with Article 14 (1) of the Treaty establishing the Community. 


2. For each product, the basic duty on which Greece is to apply the successive reductions shall be the duty actually applied in respect of Member States at the date of entry into force of this Agreement. 


3. The timetable for the reductions to be effected by the Contracting Parties shall be as follows: the first reductions shall be made on the entry into force of this Agreement. The second. third, fourth, fifth, sixth and seventh reductions shall be made at intervals of 18 months thereafter. The eighth and subsequent reductions shall. be made each year thereafter. 


4. Each reduction shall be made by lowering the basic duty on each product by 10 % . 


5. In no case, however, shall the customs duties or charges having equivalent effect which Member States apply in respect of Greece be lower than those which they apply between themselves.</article>
      <article number="ARTICLE 15" article_identifier="18401">1. Notwithstanding Article 6 and Article 14 (3) and (4), Greece shall, in respect of the tariff headings listed in Annex I to this Agreement for which an extended transitional period appears necessary, reduce as follows, over a transitional period of 22 years, the basic duties in respect of Member States of the Community: 

A reduction of 5 % on each duty shall be applied on the entry into force of this Agreement. Three further reductions, each of 5 %, shall be made at intervals of 30 months thereafter. 

The duties thus reduced shall constitute the basic duties on which the subsequent reductions are to be made from the end of the 10th year, in accordance with the timetable and conditions laid down in Article 14 (3) and 

(4). 

2. Greece may, during the first two years of application of this Agreement, and up to the equivalent of 3 % by value of its imports from the Community in 1958, amend the list in Annex I; however, the total value of that list at 1958 prices shall not be exceed~d. 


The reductions of duty on products initially subject to the tariff reductions in Article 14 and subsequently transferred to the list in Annex I shall be provisionally maintained. 

As regards products initially included in that list and subsequently removed therefrom, Greece shall apply immediately the tariff reductions already made pursuant to Article 14.</article>
      <article number="ARTICLE 16" article_identifier="18402">1. Irrespective·of the provisions of Articles 14 and 15, a Contracting Party may suspend in whole or in part the collection of duties applied by it to products imported from the other Contracting Party; the latter shall be informed of such measures. 


2. Each Contracting Party declares its readiness to reduce its customs duties in trade with the other Contracting Party more rapidly than is provided for in Articles 14 and 15 if its general economic situation and the situation of the economic sector concerned so permit. The Council of Association shall make recommendations to this end.</article>
      <article number="ARTICLE 17" article_identifier="18403">1. Articles 12 to 16 shall also apply to customs duties of a fiscal nature. 


2. On the entry into force of this Agreement the Member States of the Community and Greece shall inform the Council of Association of their customs duties of a fiscal nature. 


3. The Member States and Greece shall retain the right to substitute for these customs duties of a fiscal nature an internal tax which complies with the provisions of Article 53. 


4. If the Council of Association finds that substitution for any customs duty of a fiscal nature meets with serious difficulties in Greece, it shall authorize that country to retain the duty on condition that it shall abolish it not later than six years after the entry into force of this Agreement. 
Such authorization must be requested within two months of the date of entry into force of this Agreement. Greece may provisionally continue to apply such a duty until a decision has been taken by the Council of Association.</article>
      <article number="ARTICLE 18" article_identifier="18404">1. Notwithstanding Articles 6, 12 and 14, and with a view to promoting the creation of new activities contributing to the country's economic development and improving the level of employment and living conditions of the Greek people, Greece may, during the transitional period laid down in Article 6, reintroduce, increase or impose customs duties on imports. 

These measures may be taken on condition that they are necessary for protecting and for promoting the development of a processing industry which did not exist in Greece at the date of entry into force of this Agreement. They shall be applied only in respect of a specific branch of production. 

2. Tariff measures of the kind described in paragraph 1 shall not, for any of the tariff headings which they affect, raise the duty on imports from the Community to more than 25 % . ad valorem. 

Tariff measures taken pursuant to this Article must not affect imports of a value exceeding in aggregate 10 % of Greek imports from the Community in 1958. For each of the products affected by such tariff measures the amount which is to be imputed to the aggregate value of 10 % shall be based on imports of that product from the Community in 1958. 

Unless the Council of Association decides otherwise, such measures shall not apply for more than nine years. 


3. Greece shall notify the Council of Association of the measures which it proposes to take; the Council may make appropriate recommendations in respect thereof if the rules and conditions set out in paragraph 1 are not complied with. 


4. On expiration of the period of validity of each of the measures· taken pursuant to this Article, the duty applied shall be abolished if no such duty previously existed, or reduced to its former level if an existing duty had been increased. In the latter event the duty shall again become subject to the rules for tariff reductions which were applicable to it. It shall be abolished by the end of the transitional period laid down in Article 15 at the latest. 
Greece may suspend the application ofArticle 20 during the period of validity of each of the measures taken pursuant to the preceding paragraphs, and in respect of the products affected by these measures. The Common Customs Tariff duties in respect of the products affected shall, however, be applied in full by the date on which the duties against Member States are abolished in respect of those products. 

5. ' The Council of Association may decide that the measures open to Greece under paragraph 1 may: 


(a) 	be extended beyond the transitional period laid down in Article 6; 


(b) 	include tariff measures which go beyond the limit of 10 % laid down in paragraph 2 of this Article; 


(c) include the option of reintroducing quotas, instead of increasing or imposing duties, provided that the quota is fixed at not less than 60 % of imports of 
\ 

the goods in question from Member States of the Community in the preceding year. The value of imports from Member States, in 1958, of the products affected by these quota measures shall be imputed to the aggregate value mentioned in paragraph 2 of this Article. 

The Council of Association shall lay down the rules for such measures and the conditions for their abolition. 


6. Tariff measures taken by Greece pursuant to the above provisions shall in no case have the effect of raising the duties on Greek imports from Member States above the level of the duties on Greek imports from third countries. 


7. The provisions of this Article shall not apply to the products listed in Annex I to this Agreement.</article>
      <article number="ARTICLE 19" article_identifier="18405">The Member States of the Community and Greece shall, at the latest four years after the date of entry into force of this Agreement, abolish between themselves customs duties on exports and charges having equivalent effect.

Adoption by Greece of the Common Customs Tariff</article>
      <article number="ARTICLE 20" article_identifier="18406">1. The Greek Customs Tariff shall be aligned on the Common Customs Tariff during the transitional period laid down in Article 6 on the basis of the duties actually applied by Greece in respect of third countries at the date of entry into force of this Agreement, and in accordance with the following rules: 


(a) 	in the case of tariff headings on which the duties actually applied by Greece at the date of entry into force of this Agreement do not differ by more than 15 % either way from the duties in the Common Customs Tariff, the latter duties shall be applied from the date of the third reduction of customs duties provided for in Article 14; 


(b) 	in any other case Greece shall,· as from the same date, apply duties reducing by 30 % the difference between the duty actually applied at the date of entry into force of this Agreement and the duty in the Common Customs Tariff; 


(c) 	this difference shall be reduced by a further 30 % on the occasion of the sixth reduction of customs duties provided for in Article 14; 


(d) the Common Customs Tariff shall be applied in its entirety when the 10th reduction of customs duties provided for in Article 14 is applied. 
2. Notwithstanding paragraph 1 Greece shall, for the products listed in Annex I to this Agreement, align its 

' customs tariff during the transitional period laid down in Article 15, in a,ccordance with the following rules: 


(a) 	seven and a half years after the date of the entry into force of this Agreement, reduce by not less than 20 % the difference between the duties actually applied at that date and the duties in the Common Customs Tariff; 


(b) 	in the case of· tariff headings on which the duties resulting from the application of subparagraph (a) of this paragraph do not differ by more than 15 % either way from the duties in the Common Customs Tariff, the latter duties shall be applied from the beginning of the 14th year; 
in any other case Greece shall, as from the same date, apply duties reducing by 30 % the difference between the duties resulting from the application of subparagraph (a) and the duties in the Common Customs Tariff; 

this difference shall be reduced by a further 30 % at the beginning of the 18th year; 

the Common Customs Tariff shall be applied in its entirety at the end of the 22nd year. 

3. In the case of particular products making·up not more than 5 % of the total value of its imports in 1958, Greece may, after consultation in the Council of Association, defer until the end of the transitional period laid down in Article 15 the reductions of duties in respect of third countries laid down in the foregoing paragraphs. 

In the case of particular products making up not more than 3 % of the total value of its imports in 1958, Greece may, after consultation in the Council of Association, retain, after expiry of the transitional period laid down in Article 15, customs duties in respect of third countries which are higher than those in the Common Customs Tariff. 

Retention of a customs duty higher than that in the Common Customs Tariff must not, however, prejudice the free movement of goods within the Association. 

In the event of an accelerated alignment of its customs tariff with the Common Customs Tariff, Greece hereby undertakes to make no substantial change in the scope of the procedures of this Agreement and to take into account Community practice in this field. 

As regards the products listed in Annex I, no such acceleration may take place before the end of the 12th year from the entry into force of this Agreement, unless prior authorization has been given by the Council of Association. 

4. As regards duties which have been authorized pursuant to Article 17 ( 4), Greece need not apply the provisions of paragraphs 1 and 2 of this Article. On expiry of the authorization, Greece shall apply the duties provided for therein.</article>
      <article number="ARTICLE 21" article_identifier="18407">1. To facilitate the importation of particular goods from countries with which Greece has concluded bilateral trade agreements, Greece may, with the prior authorization of the Council of Association, grant tariff quotas at reduced or zero rates of duty, if the functioning of the agreements with those countries is substantially affected by the application of this Agreement. 


2. In no case may the duty under a tariff quota be lower than that applied in practice by Greece on imports from the Community.</article>

(a) in respect of Member States of the Community, to the degree of liberalization which they have consolidated between themselves; 


(b) 	in respect of Greece, to 60 % of its imports on private account from Member States in the reference year 1958. The percentage shall be increased to 75 % and 80 % of the abovementioned imports five and 10 years respectively after the date of entry into force of this Agreement. On the latter date Greece will endeavour to attain a higher degree of liberalization, which shall be consolidated in relation to Member States.

4. Greece may reintroduce quantitative restrictions on imports of products which have been liberalized but not consolidated pursuant to this Article. However, on reintroduction of these restrictions Greece shall open global quotas to Member States equal to at least 7 5 % of imports from the Community during the year preceding that reintroduction. Article 26 ( 4) of this Agreement shall apply to these quotas. 


5. 	In no case may Greece apply to Member States a 
treatment less favourable than that accorded to third countries.</article>

3. Three years after the entry into force of this Agreement Member States shall increase the quotas so established by not less than 10 % of the total amount thereof for the preceding year. The amount shall be increased annually in the same proportion in relation to the preceding year.

6. Where, in respect of a product which has not been liberalized, there have been no imports into Greece in the first year of application of this Agreement, the rules for opening and increasing quotas shall be laid down by mutual agreement. 


7. If the Council of Association finds that during two successive years the imports of any product which has not been liberalized have been below the level of the 
. quota opened, that quota shall 	not be taken into account in calculating the total value of the global quotas. In such case Greece shall abolish quota restrictions on imports of such products from Member States.
