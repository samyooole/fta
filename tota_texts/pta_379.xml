2. To this end, the Committee on Trade in Goods established under Article 2.15 shall, when a Party identifies a specific non-tariff measure, review that measure.

3. The Committee on Trade in Goods shall, for the non-tariff measure referred to in paragraph 2 consider approaches that may better facilitate trade between the Parties and present to the Parties the results of its consideration, including any recommendations, preferably within 12 months.

3. Before applying any new or modified import licensing procedure, a Party shall publish the new procedure or modification on an official government website or in a single official journal.  To the extent possible, the Party shall do so at least 20 days before the new procedure or modification takes effect. 


4. Neither Party shall apply an import licensing procedure to a good of the other Party unless the Party has complied with the requirements of paragraphs 2 and 3 with respect to that procedure.

to accept such a filing, the tribunal shall consider, among other things, the extent to which the amicus curiae has a significant interest in the proceeding. The tribunal shall provide the disputing parties with an opportunity to respond to such written submissions. 

2. Without prejudice to a tribunal’s authority to address other objections as a preliminary question, such as an objection that a dispute is not within the competence of the tribunal, 
including an objection to the tribunal’s jurisdiction, a tribunal shall address and decide as a 

preliminary question any objection by the respondent that, as a matter of law, a claim submitted is not a claim for which an award in favour of the claimant may be made under Article 10.30:  


(a) 	such objection shall be submitted to the tribunal as soon as possible after the tribunal is constituted, and in no event later than the date the tribunal fixes for the respondent to submit its counter-memorial (or, in the case of an amendment to the notice of arbitration, the date the tribunal fixes for the respondent to submit its response to the amendment);

(d) 	the respondent does not waive any objection as to competence, including an objection to jurisdiction, or any argument on the merits merely because the respondent did or did not raise an objection under this paragraph or make use of the expedited procedure set out in paragraph 3. 
3. In the event that the respondent so requests within 45 days of the tribunal being constituted, the tribunal shall decide on an expedited basis an objection under paragraph 2 or 

any objection that the dispute is not within the tribunal’s competence, including an objection that the dispute is not within the tribunal’s jurisdiction.  The tribunal shall suspend any 

proceedings on the merits and issue a decision or award on the objection(s), stating the grounds therefor, no later than 150 days after the date of the request.  However, if a disputing party requests a hearing, the tribunal may take an additional 30 days to issue the decision or award.  Regardless of whether a hearing is requested, a tribunal may, on a showing of extraordinary cause, delay issuing its decision or award by an additional brief period, which may not exceed 30 days. 

4. When it decides a respondent’s objection under paragraph 2 or 3, the tribunal may, if warranted, award to the prevailing disputing party reasonable costs and attorney’s fees 

incurred in submitting or opposing the objection.  In determining whether such an award is 

warranted, the tribunal shall consider whether either the claimant’s claim or the respondent’s 

objection was frivolous, and shall provide the disputing parties a reasonable opportunity to comment. 


5. A respondent shall not assert as a defence, counterclaim, right of set-off, or for any other reason that the claimant has received or will receive indemnification or other compensation for all or part of the alleged damages pursuant to an insurance or guarantee contract.

The tribunal shall consider any such comments and issue its decision or award not later than 45 days after the expiration of the 60 day comment period. 


8. The interim review procedure of disputing parties for the proposed decision or award in paragraph 7 shall not apply in any arbitration conducted pursuant to this Section for which an appeal has been made available pursuant to paragraph 9. 


9. If a separate multilateral agreement enters into force between the Parties that establishes an appellate body for the purposes of reviewing awards rendered by tribunals constituted pursuant to international trade or investment arrangements to hear investment disputes, the Parties shall strive to reach an agreement that would have such appellate body review decisions and awards rendered under this Article and Article 10.30 in arbitrations commenced after the multilateral agreement enters into force between the Parties.

(e) 	On the request of a respondent, the Joint Commission shall consider issuing a decision in writing regarding a determination by the tribunal that information claimed to be protected was not properly designated. If the Joint Commission issues a decision within 60 days of such a request, it shall be binding on the tribunal, and any decision or award issued by the tribunal must be consistent with that decision. If the Joint Commission does not issue a decision within 60 days, and provided that the non-disputing Party submits a written statement to 

the Joint Commission within that period that it agrees with the tribunal’s determination, the tribunal’s determination shall remain in effect.

7. A procuring entity may maintain a multi-use list of suppliers, provided that a notice inviting interested suppliers to apply for inclusion on the list is: 


(a) 	published annually; 


(b) 	where published by electronic means, made available continuously; and 


(c) 	published in the appropriate medium listed in Annex 13-A. 
8. The notice provided for in paragraph 7 shall include:

(ii) 	the protection of patents, copyrights or other exclusive rights; or 
(iii) 	due to an absence of competition for technical reasons;
