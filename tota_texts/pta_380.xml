In the event of any inconsistency between this Agreement and any such convention, that convention shall prevail to the extent of the inconsistency. In the case of a tax convention between the Parties, the competent authorities under that convention shall have sole responsibility for determining whether any inconsistency exists between this Agreement and that convention.

(e) 	apply to the adoption or enforcement of any taxation measure aimed at ensuring the equitable or effective imposition or collection of taxes, as permitted by Article XIV(d) of GATS.

7. 	(a) Articles 9.12 (Expropriation) and 9.16 (Investor-State Dispute Settlement) shall apply to a taxation measure alleged to be an expropriation. However, no investor may invoke Article 9.12 (Expropriation) as the basis of a claim where it has been determined in accordance with this paragraph that the measure is not an expropriation 2 . An investor that seeks to invoke Article 9.12 (Expropriation) with respect to a taxation measure must first refer to the competent authorities, at the time that it gives written notice of intent under Article 9.16 (Investor-State Dispute Settlement), the issue of whether that taxation measure involves an expropriation. If the competent authorities do not agree to consider the issue or, having agreed to consider it, fail to agree that the measure is not an expropriation within a period of six months of such referral, the investor may submit its claim to arbitration under Article 9.16 (Investor-State Dispute Settlement). 

(b) 	For purposes of this paragraph, competent authorities means: 


(i) 	for Korea, the Deputy Minister for Tax and Customs, Ministry of Strategy and Finance, or its successor; and 


(ii) 	for Peru, the Ministry of Economy and Finance (Ministerio de Economía y Finanzas), or its successor. 

8. 	For purposes of this Article, 
(a) 	taxes and taxation measures do not include: 

2 	With reference to Article 9.12 (Expropriation) in assessing whether a taxation measure constitutes expropriation, the following considerations are relevant : 


(a) 	the imposition of taxes does not generally constitutes expropriation. The mere introduction of new taxation measures or the imposition of taxes in more than one jurisdiction in respect of an investment does not in itself constitute expropriation; 


(b) 	taxation measures which are consistent with internationally recognized tax policies, principles, and practices do not constitute expropriation and in particular, taxation measures aimed at preventing the avoidance or evasion of taxes should not, generally, be considered to be expropriatory; and 


(c) 	taxation measures which are applied on a non-discriminatory basis, as opposed to being targeted at investors of a particular nationality or specific individual taxpayers, are less likely to constitute expropriation. A taxation measure should not constitute expropriation if, when the investment is made, it was already in force, and information about the measure was made public or otherwise made publicly available. 


(i) 	a customs duty as defined in Article 1.4 (General Definitions); or 


(ii) 	the measures listed in subparagraphs (b) and (c) of the definition of customs duty set out in Article 1.4 (General Definitions); and 

(b) 	tax convention means a convention for the avoidance of double taxation or other international taxation agreement or arrangement.</article>
