the Community or in Turkey. 


2. Goods given free pratique in the Commnity or in Turkey shall be deemed to be 
products coming from third countries in respect of which the necessary import

equivalent effect have been levied in the Community or in Turkey, and which have 
not benefited by any total or partial drawback on such duties or charges. 



3. Goods imported from thirds countries into the Community or in Turkey under 
special customs treatment by reason of their origin or their provenance may not be

levy charged at a rate equal to a percentage of the Common Customs Tariff duties 
applicable to the products from third countries used in their manufacture. The 
said percentage, which shall be fixed by the associationon Council for each period 
as it may determine, shall be based on the tariff reduction granted to the goods
in the importing State. The Association Council shall likewise determine the 
procedures for collecting the compensatory levy, taking into account the rules in
