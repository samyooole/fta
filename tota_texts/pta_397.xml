claimant means an investor of a Party that is a party to an investment dispute with the other 


Party; 
disputing parties means the claimant and the respondent; 
disputing party means either the claimant or the respondent; 
enterprise means an enterprise as defined in Article 1.3 (Definitions), and a branch of an 


enterprise; 


enterprise of a Party means an enterprise constituted or organized under the law of a Party, and a branch located in the territory of a Party and carrying out business activities there; ICSID means the International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes (ICSID) 

established by the ICSID Convention; 

8-17 


ICSID Additional Facility Rules means the Rules Governing the Additional Facility for the Administration of Proceedings by the Secretariat of the International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes; 

ICSID Convention means the Convention on the Settlement of Investment Disputes between States and Nationals of Other States, done at Washington, March 18, 1965; 

investment means every asset that an investor owns or controls, directly or indirectly, that has the characteristics of an investment, including such characteristics as the commitment of capital or other resources, the expectation of gain or profit, or the assumption of risk. Forms that an investment may take include: 


(a) 	an enterprise; 


(b) 	shares, stock, and other forms of equity participation in an enterprise; 


(c) 	bonds, debentures, other debt instruments, and loans13;

(h) 	other tangible or intangible, movable or immovable property, and related property rights, such as leases, mortgages, liens, and pledges16. 
But investment does not mean: 

(a)	  public debt operations17; 

13 Some forms of debt, such as bonds, debentures, and long-term notes, are more likely to have the 
characteristics of an investment, while other forms of debt are less likely to have such characteristics. 
14 Whether a particular type of license, authorization, permit, or similar instrument (including a concession, to 
the extent that it has the nature of such an instrument) has the characteristics of an investment depends on such 
factors as the nature and extent of the rights that the holder has under the law of the Party. Among the licenses, 
authorizations, permits, and similar instruments that do not have the characteristics of an investment are those 
that do not create any rights protected under domestic law. For greater certainty, the foregoing is without 
prejudice to whether any asset associated with the license, authorization, permit, or similar instrument has the 
characteristics of an investment. 
15 The term “investment” does not include an order or judgment entered in a judicial or administrative action. 
16 For greater certainty, market share, market access, expected gains, and opportunities for profit-making are not, 
by themselves, investments. 
17 Notwithstanding, public debt operations are subject to Articles 8.3 and 8.4. No award may be made in favor 
of a claimant for a claim under Article 8.18 with respect to default or non-payment of public debt operations, 
unless the claimant meets its burden of proving that such default or non-payment constitutes a breach of 
obligation under Article 8.3 or 8.4. 

(b) 	claims to money that arise solely from: 


(i) 	commercial contracts for the sale of goods or services by a national or enterprise in the territory of a Party to an enterprise in the territory of the other Party; 


(ii) 	the extension of credit in connection with a commercial transaction, such as trade financing; or 
(iii) 	an order entered in a judicial or administrative action; 

investor of a non-Party means, with respect to a Party, an investor that attempts to make, is making, or has made an investment in the territory of that Party, that is not an investor of either Party; 

investor of a Party means a Party or state enterprise thereof, or a national or an enterprise of a Party, that attempts to make18, is making, or has made an investment in the territory of the other Party; provided, however, that a natural person who is a dual national shall be deemed to be exclusively a national of the State of his or her dominant and effective nationality; 

New York Convention means the United Nations Convention on the Recognition and Enforcement of Foreign Arbitral Awards, done at New York, June 10, 1958; 

non-disputing Party means the Party that is not a party to an investment dispute; 

respondent means the Party that is a party to an investment dispute; 

Secretary-General means the Secretary-General of ICSID; and 

UNCITRAL Arbitration Rules means the arbitration rules of the United Nations Commission on International Trade Law. 

For greater certainty, a claim under Article 8.18 for breach of obligations under Article 8.3 or 8.4 with respect to default or non-payment of public debt operations shall be solely based in breach of obligations under such articles and shall not be based in breach of obligations under any other article of Section A such as Article 8.7.18 For greater certainty, it is understood that an investor “attempts to make an investment” only when the investor has taken concrete steps necessary to make the said investment, such as when the investor has duly filed an application for a permit or a license required to make an investment or has obtained the financing providing it with the funds to set up the investment.</article>

6. 	(a) Article 8.7 (Expropriation and Compensation) and Article 8.17 (Settlement of Dispute between a Party and an Investor of the Other Party) shall apply to a taxation measure alleged to be an expropriation or a breach of an investment agreement or investment authorization. However, no investor may invoke Article 8.7 (Expropriation and Compensation) as the basis for a claim where it has been determined pursuant to this subparagraph that the measure is not an expropriation.3 An investor that seeks to invoke Article 8.7 (Expropriation and Compensation) with respect to a taxation measure must first refer to the competent authorities, at the time that it gives its notice of intent under Article 

8.17 (Settlement of Dispute between a Party and an Investor of the Other Party), the issue of whether that taxation measure involves an expropriation. If the competent authorities do not agree to consider the issue or, having agreed to consider it, fail to agree that the measure is not an expropriation within a period of 180 days of such referral, the investor may submit its claim to arbitration under Article 8.17 (Settlement of Dispute between a Party and an Investor of the Other Party); and 

(b) 	For purposes of this paragraph, competent authorities means:

3 	The determination of whether a taxation measure, in a specific fact situation, constitutes an expropriation requires a case-by-case, fact-based inquiry that considers all relevant factors relating to the investment, including the factors listed in Annex 8-B (Expropriation) and the following considerations: 


(a) the imposition of taxes does not generally constitute an expropriation. The mere introduction of a new taxation measure or the imposition of a taxation measure in more than one jurisdiction in respect of an investment generally does not in and of itself constitute an expropriation; 


(b) a taxation measure that is consistent with internationally recognized tax policies, principles, and practices should not constitute an expropriation. In particular, a taxation measure aimed at preventing the avoidance or evasion of taxation measures generally does not constitute an expropriation; 


(c) a taxation measure that is applied on a non-discriminatory basis, as opposed to a taxation measure that is targeted at investors of a particular nationality or at specific taxpayers, is less likely to constitute an expropriation; and 


(d) a taxation measure generally does not constitute an expropriation if it was already in force when the investment was made and information about the measure was publicly available. 

(i) 	a customs duty as defined in Article 1.3 (Definitions); or 


(ii) 	the measures listed in exceptions (b), (c), (d), and (e) of that definition; and 
(b) 	tax convention means a convention for the avoidance of double taxation or other international taxation agreement or arrangement.</article>
