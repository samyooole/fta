      <article number="ARTICLE 17" name="Emergency Action On Imports Of Particular Products" article_identifier="6843">1. Where any product originating in a Party, as a result of the reduction or elimination of a customs duty under this Agreement, is being imported into the territory of another Party in such increased quantities and under such conditions as to constitute a substantial cause of serious injury or threat thereof to the domestic industry of like or directly competitive products in the territory of the importing Party, the importing Party may take emergency measures to the minimum extent necessary to remedy or prevent the injury. 2. Such measures shall consist in increasing the rate of customs duty on the product to a level not to exceed the lesser of: a) the most-favoured nation (MFN) rate of duty in effect at the time the action is taken; and b) the MFN applied rate of duty in effect on the day immediately preceding the date of the entry into force of this Agreement. 3.  Emergency measures shall be taken for a period not exceeding one year.  In very exceptional circumstances, after review by the Joint Committee, measures may be taken up to a total maximum period of three years. A Party taking such measures shall present a schedule leading to their progressive elimination. No measures shall be applied to the import of a product which has previously been subject to such a measure for a period of, at least, five years since the expiry of the measure. 4. Emergency measures shall only be taken upon clear evidence that increased imports have caused or are threatening to cause serious injury pursuant to an investigation in accordance with the procedures laid down in the WTO Agreement on Safeguards. 5. The Party intending to take an emergency measure under this Article shall promptly make a notification to the other Parties and the Joint Committee, containing all pertinent information which shall include evidence of serious injury or threat thereof caused by increased imports, precise description of the product involved, the proposed measure, proposed date of introduction and expected duration of the investigation and the proposed measure. Any Party that may be affected by the measure shall simultaneously be offered compensation in the form of substantially equivalent trade liberalisation in relation to the imports from any such Party. 6. The Joint Committee shall, within 30 days from the date of notification, examine the information provided under paragraph 5 in order to facilitate a mutually acceptable resolution to the matter.  In the absence of such resolution, the importing Party may adopt a measure pursuant to paragraph 2 to remedy the problem, and, in the absence of mutually agreed compensation, the Party against whose product the measure is taken may take compensatory action. The emergency measure and the compensatory action shall be immediately notified to the Joint Committee. The compensatory action shall consist of suspension of concessions having substantially equivalent trade effects or concessions substantially equivalent to the value of the additional duties expected to result from the emergency action.  In the selection of the emergency measure and the compensatory action, priority must be given to the action which least disturbs the functioning of this Agreement. 7. In critical circumstances, where delay would cause damage which would be difficult to repair, a Party may take a provisional emergency measure pursuant to a preliminary determination that there is clear evidence that increased imports have caused or are threatening to cause serious injury. The Party intending to take such a measure shall immediately inform the other Parties and the Joint Committee thereof. The duration of any such provisional measure shall be counted as part of the initial period and any extension.   8. Two years after entry into force of this Agreement the Parties shall meet to review this Article with a view to determining whether there is a need to maintain an emergency action mechanism. 9.  If the Parties decide, after the first review, to maintain such a mechanism, they shall thereafter conduct biennial reviews in the Joint Committee.</article>
      <article number="ARTICLE 18" name="Balance-Of-Payments Difficulties" article_identifier="6844">1.

A Party in serious balance-of-payments difficulties, or under imminent threat thereof, may, in accordance with the conditions established under the GATT 1994 and the WTO Understanding on the Balance-of-Payments Provisions, adopt trade restrictive measures, which shall be of limited duration and non-discriminatory, and may not go beyond what is necessary to remedy the balance-of-payments situation. The relevant provisions of the GATT 1994 and the WTO Understanding on the Balance-of-Payments Provisions are hereby incorporated into and made part of this Agreement. 3. The Party introducing a measure under this Article shall promptly notify the other Parties and the Joint Committee thereof.</article>
      <article number="ARTICLE 19" name="General Exceptions" article_identifier="6845">Subject to the requirement that such measures are not applied in a manner which would constitute a means of arbitrary or unjustifiable discrimination between countries where the same conditions prevail, or a disguised restriction on international trade, nothing in this Agreement shall be construed to prevent the adoption or enforcement by any Party of measures: (a) necessary to protect public morals; (b) necessary to protect human, animal or plant life or health; 
(c) relating to the importations or exportations of gold and silver;  
(d) necessary to secure compliance with laws or regulations which are not inconsistent with the provisions of this Agreement, including those relating to customs enforcement, the enforcement of monopolies operated under paragraph 4 of Article II and Article XVII of the GATT 1994, the protection of patents, trade marks and copyrights, and the prevention of deceptive practices; (e) relating to the products of prison labour; (f) imposed for the protection of national treasures of artistic, historic or archaeological value; (g) relating to the conservation of exhaustible natural resources if such measures are made effective in conjunction with restrictions on domestic production or consumption; (h) undertaken in pursuance of obligations under any intergovernmental commodity agreement which conforms to criteria submitted to the Members of the WTO and not disapproved by them or which is itself so submitted and not so disapproved; (i) involving restrictions on exports of domestic materials necessary to ensure essential quantities of such materials to a domestic processing industry during periods when the domestic price of such materials is held below the world price as part of a governmental stabilization plan; provided that such restrictions shall not operate to increase the exports of or the protection afforded to such domestic industry, and shall not depart from the provisions of the GATT 1994 relating to non discrimination; (j) essential to the acquisition or distribution of products in general or local short supply; provided that any such measures shall be consistent with the principle that all Members of the WTO are entitled to an equitable share of the international supply of such products, and that any such measures, which are inconsistent with the other provisions of this Agreement shall be discontinued as soon as the conditions giving rise to them have ceased to exist.</article>
      <article number="ARTICLE 20" name="Security Exceptions" article_identifier="6846">Nothing in this Chapter shall be construed: 



(a) to require any Party to furnish any information the disclosure of which it considers contrary to its essential security interests; or (b) to prevent any Party from taking any action which it considers necessary for the protection of its essential security interests (i) relating to fissionable materials or the materials from which they are derived;

      <article number="ARTICLE 22" name="Definitions" article_identifier="6848">For the purposes of this Chapter: (a) “measure” means any measure by a Party, whether in the form of a law, regulation, rule, procedure, decision, administrative action or any other form; (b)  “supply of a service” includes the production, distribution, marketing, sale and delivery of a service; 1  Article 21 was amended by Joint Committee Decision No. 1 of 2011 (23 November 2011). The Decision will enter into force when the instruments of acceptance have been deposited by all Parties with the Depositary. The Article will then be replaced. 2  The terms “aircraft repair and maintenance services”, “selling and marketing of air transport services” and “computer reservation system (CRS) services” are as defined in paragraph 6 of the Annex on Air Transport Services to the GATS. 3  Where the service is not supplied directly by a juridical person but through other forms of commercial presence such as a branch or a representative office, the service supplier (i.e. the juridical person) shall, nonetheless, through such presence be accorded the treatment provided for service suppliers under this Agreement. Such treatment shall be extended to the presence through which the service is supplied and need not be extended to any other parts of the supplier located outside the territory where the service is supplied. 4  This also includes juridical persons intending to engage in substantive business operations such as  start-up companies. 5  If a Party undertakes a market-access commitment in relation to the supply of a service through the mode of supply referred to in Article 22 (o) (i) and if the cross-border movement of capital is an essential part of the service itself, that Party is thereby committed to allow such movement of capital. If a Party undertakes a market-access commitment in relation to the supply of a service through the mode of supply referred to in Article 22 (o) (iii), it is thereby committed to allow related transfers of capital into its territory. 6  Paragraph 2 (c) does not cover measures of a Party which limit inputs for the supply of services. 7  Specific commitments assumed under this Article shall not be construed to require any Party to compensate for any inherent competitive disadvantages which result from the foreign character of the relevant services or services suppliers. 8  The term “relevant international organisations” refers to international bodies whose membership is open to the relevant bodies of the Parties. 9  The sole fact of requiring a visa for natural persons of a certain nationality and not for those of others shall not be regarded as nullifying or impairing benefits under a specific commitment. 10  The public order exception may be invoked only where a genuine and sufficiently serious threat is posed to one of the fundamental interests of society. 11  Measures that are aimed at ensuring the equitable or effective imposition or collection of direct taxes include measures taken by a Party under its taxation system which: (i) apply to non-resident service suppliers in recognition of the fact that the tax obligation of non-residents is determined with respect to taxable items sourced or located in the Party's territory; or (ii) apply to non-residents in order to ensure the imposition or collection of taxes in the Party's territory; or (iii) apply to non-residents or residents in order to prevent the avoidance or evasion of taxes, including compliance measures; or (iv) apply to consumers of services supplied in or from the territory of another Party in order to ensure the imposition or collection of taxes on such consumers derived from sources in the  Party’s territory; or (v) distinguish service suppliers subject to tax on worldwide taxable items from other service suppliers, in recognition of the difference in the nature of the tax base between them; or (vi) determine, allocate or apportion income, profit, gain, loss, deduction or credit of resident persons or branches, or between related persons or branches of the same person, in order to safeguard the Member's tax base. Tax terms or concepts in Article 33 (d) and in this footnote are determined according to tax definitions and concepts, or equivalent or similar definitions and concepts, under the domestic law of the Party taking the measure. 12  Footnote 10 under Article 33 of Chapter III on Services shall also apply mutatis mutandis to this Chapter. 13  Rules of procedure were adopted by Joint Committee Decision No. 1 of 2004 (26 May 2004). 14  The word “such” refers to “a measure applied by the Party or Parties to which the request is made”. 15  Model rules of procedure were adopted by Joint Committee Decision No. 2 of 2004  (26 May 2004). (c) “measures by Parties affecting trade in services” include measures in respect of: 
(i) the purchase, payment or use of a service; 


(ii) the access to and use of, in connection with the supply of a service, services which are required by those Parties to be offered to the public generally; 


(iii) the presence, including commercial presence, of persons of a Party for the supply of a service in the territory of another Party; 
(d)  “commercial presence” means any type of business or professional establishment, including through: 
(i) the constitution, acquisition or maintenance of a juridical person; or 
(ii) the creation or maintenance of a branch or a representative office;  within the territory of a Party for the purpose of supplying a service; (e) “sector” of a service means: (i) with reference to a specific commitment, one or more, or all, subsectors of that service, as specified in a Party’s Schedule; 
(ii) otherwise, the whole of that service sector, including all of its subsectors;

3
; 

(g) “service consumer” means any person that receives or uses a service; 
(h) “service of another Party” means a service which is supplied: (i) from or in the territory of that other Party, or in the case of maritime transport, by a vessel registered under the laws of that other Party, or by a person of that other Party which supplies the service through the operation of a vessel and/or its use in whole or in part; or (ii) in the case of the supply of a service through commercial presence or through the presence of natural persons, by a service supplier of that other Party; (i) “person” means either a natural person or a juridical person; 
(j) “natural person of a Party” means a natural person who resides in the territory of that Party or elsewhere and who under the law of that Party: (i) is a national of that Party; or 


(ii) has the right of permanent residence in that Party and is accorded substantially the same treatment as nationals in respect of measures affecting trade in services; 

(k) “juridical person” means any legal entity duly constituted or otherwise organised under applicable law, whether for profit or otherwise, and whether privately-owned or governmentally-owned, including any corporation, trust, partnership, joint venture, sole proprietorship or association; 


(l) “juridical person of another Party” means a juridical person which is either: (i) constituted or otherwise organised under the law of that other Party, and is engaged in substantive business operations

(m) a juridical person is:  (i) “owned” by persons of a Party if more than 50 per cent of the equity interest in it is beneficially owned by persons of that Party;  (ii) “controlled” by persons of a Party if such persons have the power to name a majority of its directors or otherwise to legally direct its actions; (iii)  “affiliated” with another person when it controls, or is controlled by, that other person; or when it and the other person are both controlled by the same person;  
(n) “monopoly supplier of a service” means any person, public or private, which in the relevant market of the territory of a Party is authorised or established formally or in effect by that Party as the sole supplier of that service; 
(o) “trade in services” means the supply of a service: (i) from the territory of a Party into the territory of another Party (hereinafter referred to as “cross-border supply”); (ii) in the territory of a Party to the service consumer of another Party (hereinafter referred to as “consumption abroad”);

Subject to exceptions that may derive from harmonisation of regulations based on agreements concluded by a Party with a non-Party providing for mutual recognition in accordance with Article VII of the GATS, and except as provided in Annex VI, a Party shall accord immediately and unconditionally, with respect to any measure covered by this Chapter, to services and service suppliers of another Party treatment no less favourable than that it accords to like services and service suppliers of any non-Party. 2. Treatment granted under other agreements concluded by one of the Parties with a non-Party which have been notified under Article V of the GATS shall not be subject to paragraph 1. 3. If a Party enters into an agreement of the type referred to in paragraph 2, it shall, upon request from another Party, afford adequate opportunity to the other Parties to negotiate the benefits granted therein.</article>
