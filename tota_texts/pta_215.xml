Estonia shall apply these restrictions in a non-discriminatory manner. They shall be applied in such a manner as to cause the least possible disruption to this Agreement. Estonia shall inform the Joint Committee promptly of the introduction of such measures and of any changes therein.</article>
      <article number="ARTICLE 32" article_identifier="18270">1. The following are incompatible with the proper functioning of this Agreement, in so far as they may affect trade between the Community and Estonia: 


(i) 	all agreements between undertakings, decisions by associations of undertakings and concerted practices between undertakings which have as their object or effect the prevention, restriction or distortion of competition; 


(ii) 	abuse by one or more undertakings of a dominant position in the territories of the Community or of Estonia as a whole or in a substantial part thereof; 
(iii) 	any public aid, which distorts or threatens to distort competition by favouring certain undertakings or the production of certain goods. 


2. Any practices contrary to this Article shall be assessed on the basis of criteria arising from the application of the rules of Articles 85, 86 and 92 of the Treaty establishing the European Community or, for products covered by the ECSC Treaty, on the basis of corresponding rules of the ECSC Treaty including secondary legislation. 


3. The Joint Committee shall, within three years of the entry into force of this Agreement, adopt by decision the necessary rules for the implementation of paragraphs 1 and 2. 

Until these rules are adopted, the provisions of this Agreement on interpretation and application of Articles VI, XVI and XXIII of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade shall be applied as the rules for the implementation of paragraphs 1 point (iii) and related parts of paragraph 2. 

4. 	(a) For the purposes of applying the provisions of paragraph 1 point (iii), the Parties recognize that during the first five years after the entry into force of this Agreement, any public aid granted by Estonia shall be assessed taking into account the fact that Estonia shall be regarded as an area identical to those areas of the Community described in Article 92 (3) (a) of the Treaty establishing the European Community. The Joint Committee shall, taking into account the economic situation of Estonia, decide whether that period should be extended by further periods of three years. 

(b) 	Each Party shall ensure transparency in the area of public aid, inter alia by reporting annually to the other Party on the total amount and the distribution of the aid given and by providing, upon request, information on aid schemes. Upon request by one Party, the other Party shall provide information on particular individual cases of public aid. 

5. 	With regard to products referred to in Chapters II and III of Title II: 
-	the provision of paragraph 1 point (iii) does not apply, 

-any practices contrary to Paragraph 1 point (i) should be assessed according to the criteria established by the Community on the basis of Articles 42 and 43 of the Treaty establishing the European Community and in particular of those established in Council Regulation No. 26. 

6. If the Community or Estonia considers that a particular practice is incompatible with the terms of the first paragraph of this Article, and 

-is not adequately dealt with under the implementing rules referred to in paragraph 3, or 

-in the absence of such rules, and if such practice causes or threatens to cause serious prejudice to the interests of the other Party or material injury to its domestic industry, including its services industry, 

it may take appropriate measures after consultation within the Joint Committee or after 30 days following referral for such consultation. 

In the case of practices incompatible with paragraph 1 point (iii) of this Article, such appropriate measures may, where the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade applies thereto, only be adopted in conformity with the procedures and under the conditions laid down by the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade and any other relevant instrument negotiated under its auspices which are applicable between the Parties. 

7. Notwithstanding any provisions to the contrary adopted in conformity with paragraph 3, the Parties shall exchange information taking into account the limitations imposed by the requirements of professional and business secrecy.</article>
      <article number="ARTICLE 33" article_identifier="18271">1. The Parties shall endeavour to avoid the imposition of restrictive measures including measures relating to imports for balance of payments purposes. In the event of their introduction, the Party having introduced the same shall present to the other Party as soon as possible, a time schedule for their removal. 


2. Where one or more Member States or Estonia is in serious balance of payments difficulties, or under imminent threat thereof, the Community or Estonia, as the case may be, may, in accordance with the conditions established under the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, adopt restrictive measures, including measures relating to imports, which shall be of limited duration and may not go beyond what is necessary to remedy the balance of payments situation. The Community or Estonia, as the case may be, shall inform the other Party forthwith.</article>
      <article number="ARTICLE 34" article_identifier="18272">With regard to public undertakings, and undertakings to which special or exclusive rights have been granted, the Joint Committee shall ensure that as from the fourth year following the date of entry into force of this Agreement, the principles of the Treaty establishing the European Community, notably Article 90, and the principles of the concluding document of the April 1990 Bonn meeting of the Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe, notably entrepreneurs' freedom of decision, are upheld.</article>

      <article number="ARTICLE 36" article_identifier="18274">1.

2. The approximation of laws shall extend to the following areas in particular: dumping, rules on competition, customs legislation, technical rules and standards. 


3. The Community shall provide Estonia with technical assistance for the implementation of these measures, which may include inter alia: -the exchange of experts, -the provision of early information especially on relevant legislation, -organization of seminars,
