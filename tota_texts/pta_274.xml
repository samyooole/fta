(i) 	because the duties and charges levied in the exporting territory 
on imports of raw materials or intermediate products used in 
the production of the product in question are significantly lower 
than the corresponding duties or charges levied in the importing 
territory and, additionally or alternatively, 



(ii) 	because of drawback granted in the exporting territory

and their causes. They shall take such decisions as are necessary in order to 
deal with the causes of deflection of trade by amending the rules of origin or 
by such other means as they may consider appropriate.

affected may take such interim measures to safeguard its position as appear to 
be necessary; such measures shall not continue for longer than is necessary 
to enable the parties to review the position and in anycase shall not continue 
for longer than three months unless the parties otherwise agree.

a different kind which are substitutable for the imported goods, 
which enter into direct competition with them, and which do not bear, 
directly or indirectly, in the importing territory fiscal charges of 
equivalent incidence;
