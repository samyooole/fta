  the other Party in accordance with Article 18 before taking
  any action affecting the trade of the other Party.

  2. Neither Party shall take an action which provides solely
  for a suspension of the reduction or elimination of any duty
  provided for by this Agreement unless the serious injury or
  threat thereof which is substantially caused by imports to
  the domestic producers of like or directly competitive
  products results from the reduction or elimination of a duty
  provided for by this Agreement.

  3. When, in the view of the importing Party, the importation
  of a product from the other Party is not a substantial cause
  of the serious injury or threat thereof referred to in
  paragraph1, the importing Party may except the product of
  the other Party from any import relief that may be imposed
  with respect to imports of that product from third
  countries, taking into account the objective of achieving

  these rules do not have the effect of unduly obstructing
  trade.

  2. With reference to the matters in paragraph 1,the Parties
  shall consult on any difficulties that may arise in their
  trade in agricultural products and shall seek to provide
  solutions which will allow trade in agricultural products
  insofar as they do not endanger animal and plant health.

  3. To insure harmonious development of trade in agricultural
  products, the Joint Committee shall establish a working
  group, in accordance with subparagraph 3 (b) of Article 17,
  which shall convene at the request of either Party to
  consider matters relating to paragraphs 1 and 2 of this
  Article.</article>
      <article number="ARTICLE 10" name="Infant Industry" article_identifier="10978">1. Insofar as its industrialization and development make

  after that date, upon agreement within the Joint Committee,
  introduce, increase or re-introduce ad valorem customs
  duties not exceeding20 percentage points above the level
  that would otherwise be in effect. The total value of the
  products for which these measures can be applied may not
  exceed 10% of the total value of Israel's imports from the
  United States in 1984.

  protect and favor the development of a new processing
  industry not already existing in Israel on the date of the

  products in question originating in the United States. The

  January 1, 1995.</article>
      <article number="ARTICLE 11" name="Balance Of Payments" article_identifier="10979">1. a. A Party may apply temporary trade measures when it is
  threatened by, or suffers from, a serious balance of
  payments situation. A Party may impose temporary trade
  measures only to provide time for macroeconomic adjustment
  measures to correct its balance of payments problems to take
  effect. Temporary trade measures permitted by this paragraph
  may not be used to protect individual industries or sectors.

  b. A serious balance of payments situation would be
  indicated by one or more of the following: a substantial
  deterioration in the trade and current account positions,
  significant pressure on the exchange rate, or a substantial
  fall in net reserves, as projected either in a decrease of
  reserves or in an increase of short term debt.

  2. Temporary trade measures which may be applied under
  paragraph 1 are:

  a. an import surcharge in the form of import duties;

  b. an import deposit; or

  c. quantitative restrictions.

  3. a. Whenever practicable the Parties will prefer the use
  of the temporary measures specified in subparagraphs 2 (a)
  and 2 (b). Quantitative restrictions will be imposed when
  measures2(a) and 2(b) would be inadequate in terms of their
  balance of payments effects.

  b. Whenever practicable, the Parties will avoid applying
  more than one of the measures specified in paragraph 2 to
  any single product at the same time.

  4. A temporary trade measure applied under paragraph1 may
  remain in force for a period not exceeding 150 days unless
  extended by the appropriate legislative body of the Party
  concerned for a subsequent period of 150 days. Quantitative
  restrictions may be extended only for one additional period
  of 150 days.

  5. Temporary trade measures applied under paragraph1 will be
  consistent in duration and effect with the severity of the
  balance of payments problem experienced by the Party
  imposing the measures and will be progressively relaxed
  consistent with improvements in that Party's balance of
  payments situation.

  6. In the event that temporary trade measures are applied
  under paragraph 1, consultations will be held between the
  Parties on the balance of payments situation, to consider,
  inter alia, other economic measures which might be taken to
  deal with the balance of payments problems to permit early
  elimination of the temporary trade measures. Significant
  intensification of trade measures may be a cause for
  consultations between the Parties.

  7. In applying temporary trade measures, the Parties will
  accord treatment no less favorable to imports originating in
  the other Party than to imports originating in third
  countries, and will not impair the relative benefits
  accorded to the other Party under this Agreement.

  8. Temporary trade measures specified under subparagraphs2
  (a) and 2 (b) shall apply to all imports, except that
  certain imports may be excluded if their exclusion improves
  the effectiveness of the measures consistent with the
  purposes stated in paragraph1.

  Article 11 shall be subject to the procedures of Articles 18
  and 19. It is understood that notification for balance of
  payments reasons will generally be provided under paragraph3
  of Article 18.</article>
      <article number="ARTICLE 12" name="Licensing" article_identifier="10980">1. Neither Party shall impose import licensing requirements
  on items exported by the other Party, unless licenses issued
  under such requirements are:

  a. automatically approved;

  b. necessary to administer a quantitative ceiling on imports
  justified under this Agreement or under the GATT insofar as
  it is not inconsistent with this Agreement; or

  c. necessary to administer restrictions in conformity with
  this Agreement or under the GATT insofar as it is not
  inconsistent with this Agreement.

  2. Each Party shall answer within thirty days all reasonable
  inquiries from the other Party with regard to criteria
  employed by its respective licensing authorities in granting
  or denying import licenses. In addition, the Parties
  recognize the desirability of publication of such criteria.

  3. The Parties shall provide each other with a list of items
  subject to licensing requirements which shall specify
  whether each item is entitled to automatic or non-automatic
  import licensing. Notification of changes in this list shall
  be made on a timely basis and shall include a justification
  for each addition.

  4. If an import license is denied for an item specified in
  the list prepared pursuant to paragraph 3 as being entitled
  to automatic licensing, then such item shall be considered
  to be subject to non-automatic licensing. Notification and
  justification for the action shall be provided within sixty
  days by the Party which has made such denial.

  5. In the administration of automatic and non-automatic
  licensing requirements, the Parties shall adhere to the
  provisions of the Agreement on Import Licensing Procedures.
  For the purposes of this Agreement the reporting
  requirements provided in the Agreement on Import Licensing
  Procedures between the Contracting Parties of said agreement
  shall only apply to the United States and Israel.</article>
      <article number="ARTICLE 13" name="Trade-Related Performance Requirements" article_identifier="10981">Neither Party shall impose, as a condition of establishment,
  expansion or maintenance of investments by nationals or
  companies of the other Party, requirements to export any
  amount of production resulting from such investments or to

  for receiving any type of governmental incentives.</article>

  multilateral agreements relating to intellectual property
  rights, including industrial property rights, in effect
  between the Parties. Accordingly, nationals and companies of
  each Party shall continue to be accorded national and most
  favored nation treatment with respect to obtaining,
  maintaining and enforcing patents of invention, with respect
  to obtaining and enforcing copyrights, and with respect to
  rights in trademarks, service marks, trade names, trade
  labels, and industrial property of all kinds.</article>

  restrictions relating to government procurement.

  2. The United States shall waive all Buy National
  restrictions with respect to government agency purchases of

  government agencies other than the Ministry of Defense.

  6. The provisions of this Article with respect to offset
  requirements and to purchases by government agencies other

  Department of Defense shall be effective one year from the
  date of entry into force of this Agreement. The provisions
  of this Article with respect to purchases by Israel's
  Ministry of Defense and the United States Department of
  Defense shall be effective one year from the entry into
  force of this Agreement or one year from the completion by
  Israel of a list of the exceptions referred to in
  paragraph3, whichever is later.

  7. The Parties agree to consider promptly further trade
  liberalizing measures in regard to both government
  procurement and offset requirements in the context of the
  Joint Committee established by this Agreement. In particular
  it is agreed that should the entity coverage of the
  Agreement on Government Procurement be expanded, priority
  consideration will be given to expanding this Agreement to
  apply to those purchases.</article>
      <article number="ARTICLE 16" name="Trade In Services" article_identifier="10984">The Parties recognize the importance of trade in services
  and the need to maintain an open system of services exports
  which would minimize restrictions on the flow of services

  to the provisions of a Declaration to be made by the
  Parties.</article>

  settlement of the dispute. The report of the panel shall be
