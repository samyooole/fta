3. Before applying the measure as defined under paragraph 2, the Party concerned shall refer the matter to the Commission for a thorough examination of the situation, with a view to seeking 

a mutually acceptable solution. If the other Party so requests, the Parties shall hold consultations within the Commission. If no solution is found within 30 days of the request for such consultations, safeguard measures may be applied. 

4. Where exceptional circumstances require immediate action, the importing Party may take the measures provided for in paragraph 2 on a transitional basis without complying with the requirements of paragraph 3 for a maximum period of 120 days. Such measures shall not exceed what is strictly necessary to limit or redress the injury or disturbance. The importing Party shall inform the other Party immediately. 


5. The measures taken under this Article shall not exceed what is necessary to remedy the difficulties that have arisen.

To achieve this objective, the Parties may agree on compensation for the adverse effects of the measure on their trade, including the period during which a transitional measure applied in accordance with paragraph 4 is in place. To this effect, the Parties shall hold consultations to reach a mutually agreed solution. If no agreement is reached within 30 days, the affected exporting Party may, after notification to the Commission, suspend the application of substantially equivalent concessions under this Chapter. 


6. 	For purposes of this Article:

(a) 	in the absence of tenders that conform to the essential requirements in the tender documentation provided in a prior tendering procedure, including any conditions for participation, provided that the requirements of the initial procurement are not substantially modified in the contract as awarded; 


(b) 	where, for works of art, or for reasons connected with the protection of exclusive rights, such as patents, copyrights or proprietary information or  in the absence of competition for technical reasons, the goods or services can be supplied only by a particular supplier and no reasonable alternative or substitute exists; 


(c) 	for additional deliveries by the original supplier that are intended either as replacement parts, extensions, or continuing services for existing equipment, software, services or installations, where a change of supplier would compel the entity to procure goods or services not meeting requirements of interchangeability with existing equipment, software, services, or installations;

(g) 	insofar as it is strictly necessary where, for reasons of extreme urgency brought about by events unforeseeable by the entity, the goods or services could not be obtained in time under an open tendering procedure and the use of such procedure would result in serious injury to the entity, the entity’s program responsibilities or the responsible Party. This exception may not be used as a result of a lack of advance planning or concerns relating to the amount of funds available to an entity within a particular period of time.

      <article number="ARTICLE 19.15" name="Non-Implementation - Suspension Of Benefits" article_identifier="5867">1. The complaining Party may suspend the application of benefits of equivalent effect to the Party complained against if the panel resolves:

(b) 	if the complaining Party considers that it is not practicable or effective to suspend benefits in the same sector(s), it may suspend benefits in other sectors. The communication in which it announces such a decision shall indicate the reasons on which it is based.

the panel cannot be established with its original members, the proceeding set out in Article 19.9 shall be applied. 

5. The panel shall present its determination within 60 days from the request made pursuant to paragraph 4, or if a panel cannot be established with its original members, from the date on which the last panelist is selected.
