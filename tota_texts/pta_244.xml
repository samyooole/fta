BETWEEN 
THE EFTA STATES 
AND 
THE REPUBLIC OF BULGARIA 


Note: 	Austria, Finland and Sweden withdrew from the Convention establishing the European Free Trade Association (the Stockholm Convention) on 31 December 1994. In accordance with paragraph 3 of Article 37 of the Free Trade Agreement between the EFTA States and Bulgaria these three countries ceased to be Parties to the Agreement on the same day.  Consequently, in the present text, the provisions referring to Austria, Finland and Sweden have been deleted. 

PREAMBLE 


The Republic of Iceland, the Principality of Liechtenstein, the Kingdom of Norway, and the Swiss Confederation (hereinafter called the EFTA States)  

and 

the Republic of Bulgaria (hereinafter called Bulgaria), 

Recalling their intention to participate actively in the process of economic integration in Europe and expressing their preparedness to co-operate in seeking ways and means to strengthen this process, 

Considering the importance of the traditional links existing between the EFTA States and Bulgaria and the common values they share, and recognizing that the EFTA States and Bulgaria wish to strengthen these links and to establish close and lasting relations,  

Having regard to the Declaration signed by the EFTA States and Bulgaria in Geneva in December 1991, 

Recalling their firm commitment to the Final Act of the Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe, the Charter of Paris for a new Europe, and in particular the principles contained in the final document of the CSCE Bonn Conference on Economic Co-operation in Europe, 

Reaffirming their commitment to pluralistic democracy based on the rule of law, human rights, including rights of persons belonging to minorities, and fundamental freedoms, and recalling their membership in the Council of Europe, 

Considering the commitment of the EFTA States and Bulgaria to free trade, and in particular to the principles of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, 

Firmly convinced that this Agreement will foster the creation of an enlarged and harmonious free trade area within Europe, thus constituting an important contribution to European integration, 

Bearing in mind the economic and social disparities between the EFTA States and Bulgaria and thus recognizing that the objectives of this Agreement should be reached through its appropriate provisions, 

Resolved to this end to gradually establish a free trade area by eliminating progressively the obstacles to substantially all their trade, in accordance with the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, 

Declaring their readiness to examine, in the light of any relevant factor, the possibility of developing and deepening their relations in order to extend them to fields not covered by this Agreement,

Where an EFTA State or Bulgaria is in serious balance of payments difficulties, or under imminent threat thereof, the EFTA State or Bulgaria, as the case may be, may, in accordance with the conditions established under the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, adopt trade restrictive measures, which shall be of limited duration and may not go beyond what is necessary to remedy the balance of payments situation. The measures shall be progressively relaxed as balance of payments conditions improve and they shall be eliminated when conditions no longer justify this maintenance. The EFTA State or Bulgaria, as the case may be, shall inform the other States Parties to this Agreement and the Joint Committee forthwith of their introduction and, whenever practicable, of a time schedule for their removal.  


2. The States Parties to this Agreement shall, nevertheless, endeavour to avoid the imposition of restrictive measures for balance of payments purposes.</article>

2. Without prejudice to paragraph 6 of the present Article, a State Party to this Agreement, which considers resorting to safeguard measures shall promptly notify the other States Parties and the Joint Committee thereof and supply all relevant information. Consultations between the States Parties to this Agreement shall take place without delay in the Joint Committee with a view to finding a commonly acceptable solution. 


3. 	(a) As regards Articles 18 and 19, the States Parties concerned shall give to the Joint Committee all the assistance required in order to examine the case and, where appropriate, eliminate the practice objected to.  If the State Party in question fails to put an end to the practice objected to within the period fixed by the Joint Committee or if the Joint Committee fails to reach an agreement after consultations, or after three months following referral for such consultations, the State Party concerned may adopt the appropriate measures to deal with the difficulties resulting from the practice in question. 


(b) 	As regards Articles 20, 21 and 23, the Joint Committee shall examine the case or the situation and may take any decision needed to put an end to the difficulties notified by the State Party concerned.

If the Joint Committee fails to reach such a solution or if a period of three months has elapsed from the date of notification, the State Party concerned may take appropriate measures. 

4. The safeguard measures taken shall be notified immediately to the States Parties to this Agreement and to the Joint Committee.

Priority shall be given to such measures as will least disturb the functioning of the Agreement.  The measures taken by Bulgaria against an action or an omission of an EFTA State may only affect the trade with that State.

6. Where exceptional circumstances requiring immediate action make prior examination impossible, the State Party concerned may, in the cases of Articles 20, 21 and 23 and in cases of state aid having a direct and immediate incidence on trade between the States Parties, apply forthwith the precautionary and provisional measures strictly necessary to remedy the situation.  The measures shall be notified without delay and consultations between the States Parties to this Agreement shall take place as soon as possible within the Joint Committee.</article>
