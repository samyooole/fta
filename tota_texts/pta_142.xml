A requirement by a Party that a service supplier of the other Party post a bond or other form of financial security as a condition of providing a service into its territory does not of itself make this Chapter applicable to measures adopted or maintained by a Party relating to the provision of that cross-border service.  This Chapter applies to that Party’s treatment of the posted bond or financial security to the extent that such bond or financial security is a covered investment. 


4. 	This Chapter does not apply to: 


(a) 	measures adopted or maintained by a Party to the extent that they are covered by Chapter 12 (Financial Services); and

2. For greater certainty, paragraph 1 prescribes the customary international law minimum standard of treatment of aliens as the minimum standard of treatment to be afforded to covered investments.  The concepts of “fair and equitable treatment” and “full protection and security” do not require treatment in addition to or beyond that which is required by that standard, and do not create additional substantive rights.  The obligation in paragraph 1 to provide: 


(a) 	“fair and equitable treatment” includes the obligation not to deny justice in criminal, civil, or administrative adjudicatory proceedings in accordance with the principle of due process embodied in the principal legal systems of the world; and 


(b) 	“full protection and security” requires each Party to provide the level of police protection required under customary international law.

2. The tribunal shall have the authority to accept and consider amicus curiae written submissions that may assist the tribunal in evaluating the submissions and arguments of the disputing parties from a person or entity that is not a disputing party (the “submitter”).  The submissions shall be provided in both Spanish and English, and shall identify the submitter and any Party, other government, person, or organisation, other than the submitter, that has provided, or will provide, any financial or other assistance in preparing the submission. Where such submissions are admitted by the tribunal, the tribunal shall provide to the parties an opportunity to respond to such written submissions. 


3. Without prejudice to a tribunal’s authority to address other objections as a preliminary question, such as an objection that a dispute is not within the jurisdiction or the competence of the tribunal, a tribunal shall address and decide as a preliminary question any objection by the respondent that the claim is manifestly without legal merit. 


(a) 	Such objection shall be submitted to the tribunal as soon as possible after the tribunal is constituted, and in no event later than the date the tribunal fixes for the respondent to submit its counter-memorial (or, in the case of an amendment to the notice of arbitration referred to in Article 10.16.4, the date the tribunal fixes for the respondent to submit its response to the amendment). 


(b) 	On receipt of an objection under this paragraph, the tribunal shall suspend any proceedings on the merits, establish a schedule for considering the objection consistent with any schedule it has established for considering any other preliminary question, and issue a decision or award on the objection, stating the grounds therefor. 


(c) 	The respondent does not waive any objection as to the jurisdiction or competence of the tribunal or any argument on the merits merely because the respondent did or did not raise an objection under this 
paragraph or make use of the expedited procedure set out in the following paragraph. 


4. In the event that the respondent so requests within 45 days after the tribunal is constituted, the tribunal shall decide on an expedited basis an objection under paragraph 3 or any objection that the dispute is not within the tribunal’s jurisdiction or competence. The tribunal shall suspend any proceedings on the merits and issue a decision or award on the objection(s), stating the grounds therefor, no later than 150 days after the date of the request.  However, if a disputing party requests a hearing, the tribunal may take an additional 30 days to issue the decision or award.  Regardless of whether a hearing is requested, a tribunal may, on a showing of extraordinary cause, delay issuing its decision or award by an additional brief period of time, which may not exceed 30 days. 


5. When it decides a respondent’s objection under paragraph 3 or 4, the tribunal may, if warranted, award to the prevailing disputing party reasonable costs and attorneys’ fees incurred in submitting or opposing the objection.  In determining whether such an award is warranted, the tribunal shall consider whether either the claimant’s claim or the respondent’s objection was frivolous, and shall provide the disputing parties a reasonable opportunity to comment. 


6. A respondent may not assert as a defence, counterclaim, right of set-off, or otherwise that the claimant has received or will receive indemnification or other compensation for all or part of the alleged loss or damages pursuant to an insurance or guarantee contract. 


7. A tribunal may order an interim measure of protection to preserve the rights of a disputing party, or to ensure that the tribunal’s jurisdiction is made fully effective, including an order to preserve evidence in the possession or control of a disputing party or to protect the tribunal’s jurisdiction.  A tribunal may not order attachment or enjoin the application of a measure alleged to constitute a breach referred to in Article

      <article number="ARTICLE 21.12" name="Non-Implementation – Compensation And Suspension Of Concessions Or Other Obligations" article_identifier="12265">1. If the Party complained against notifies the complaining Party that it is impracticable, or the arbitral panel to which the matter is referred pursuant to Article 

21.11.4 confirms that the Party complained against has failed to eliminate the nonconformity or the nullification or impairment in the sense of Article 21.1(c) as determined in the report of the arbitral panel within the reasonable period of time as determined pursuant to Article 21.11.3, the Party complained against shall, if so requested, enter into negotiations with the complaining Party with a view to reaching mutually satisfactory compensation. 


2. If there is no agreement on satisfactory compensation within 20 days after the date of receipt of the request mentioned in paragraph 1, the complaining Party may suspend the application to the Party complained against of concessions or other obligations under this Agreement, after giving notification of such suspension 30 days in advance.  Such notification may only be given 20 days after the date of receipt of the request mentioned in paragraph 1. 


3. The compensation referred to in paragraph 1 and the suspension referred to in paragraph 2 shall be temporary measures.  Neither compensation nor suspension is preferred to full elimination of the non-conformity or the nullification or impairment in the sense of Article 21.1(c) as determined in the report of the arbitral panel.  The suspension shall only be applied until such time as the non-conformity or the nullification or impairment in the sense of Article 21.1(c) is fully eliminated, or a mutually satisfactory solution is reached. 


4. In considering what concessions or other obligations to suspend pursuant to paragraph 2: 


(a) 	the complaining Party should first seek to suspend concessions or other obligations with respect to the same sector(s) as that in which the report of the arbitral panel referred to in Article 21.10 has found a failure to comply with the obligations under this Agreement, or nullification or impairment of benefits in the sense of Article 21.1(c); and 


(b) 	if the complaining Party considers that it is not practicable or effective to suspend concessions or other obligations with respect to the same sector(s), it may suspend concessions or other obligations with respect to other sectors.  The notification of such suspension pursuant to paragraph 2 shall indicate the reasons on which it is based. 

5. The level of suspension referred to in paragraph 2 shall be equivalent to the level of the nullification or impairment. 


6. If the Party complained against considers that the requirements for the suspension of concessions or other obligations by the complaining Party set out in paragraph 2, 3, 4 or 5 have not been met, it may refer the matter to an arbitral panel. 


7. The arbitral panel that is established for the purposes of this Article or Article 
21.11 shall have, wherever possible, as its panelists, the panelists of the original arbitral panel.  If this is not possible, then the panelists to the arbitral panel that is established for the purposes of this Article or Article 21.11 shall be appointed pursuant to Article 21.7.  The arbitral panel established under this Article or Article 

21.11 shall issue its report within 60 days after the date when the matter is referred to it.  When the arbitral panel considers that it cannot issue its report within the aforementioned 60 day period, it may extend that period for a maximum of 30 days with the consent of the Parties.  The report shall be available to the public within 15 days after the date of issuance, subject to the requirement to protect confidential information.  The report shall be final and binding on the Parties.</article>

(b) 	Article 9.3 (National Treatment – Cross-Border Trade in Services Chapter), Article 9.4 (Most-Favoured-Nation Treatment – Cross-Border Trade in Services Chapter), Article 10.3 (National Treatment – Investment Chapter), Article 10.4 (Most-Favoured-Nation Treatment –
