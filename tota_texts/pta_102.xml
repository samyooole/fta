  apply mutatis mutandis to the agricultural component.

  2. For the products listed in Annex 2 originating in the Community,
  the Palestinian Authority may retain for the duration of the Agreement
  customs duties on import and charges having equivalent effect not
  higher than those in force on 1 July 1996.

  originating in the Community listed in Annex 3 imported into the West
  Bank and the Gaza Strip, the Palestinian Authority may levy fiscal
  charges not exceeding 25 % by value. These charges shall be gradually
  abolished in accordance with the following schedule:

  one year after the date of entry into force of this Agreement, each
  charge shall be reduced to 90 % of the basic charge;

  remaining charge shall be abolished.

  3. In the event of serious difficulties for a given product, the
  schedule referred to in paragraph 2 may be reviewed by the Joint
  Committee by common accord, on the understanding that it may not be
  suspended beyond the maximum transitional period of five years. If the
  Joint Committee has not taken a decision within 30 days of its
  application to review the schedule, the Palestinian Authority may
  suspend the schedule provisionally for a period which may not exceed
  one year.

  4. If the charge is reduced erga omnes, the reduced charge shall
  replace the basic charge described in paragraph 2 from the date on
  which the reduction is applied.

  particularly where those difficulties entail severe social problems.

  3. Customs duties on imports into the West Bank and the Gaza Strip of
  products originating in the Community that are introduced by such
  exceptional measures may not exceed 25 % by value, and must retain a
  preferential margin for products originating in the Community. The
  total value of imports of the products subjected to such measures may
  not exceed 15 % of total imports of industrial products originating in
  the Community during the last year for which statistics are available.

  4. Such measures shall be applied for no longer than five years,
  except where a longer duration is authorized by the Joint Committee.

  exceptional measures it intends to adopt and, at the Community's
  request, consultations shall be held on the measures and sectors
  concerned before they are implemented. When adopting such measures,
  the Palestinian Authority shall provide the Committee with a schedule
  for the abolition of the customs duties introduced pursuant to this
  Article. Such schedules shall provide for the phasing out of the
  duties concerned by equal annual instalments, starting no later than
  the end of the second year following their introduction. The Joint
  Committee may decide on a different schedule.</article>

  2. In the cases specified in Articles 20, 21 and 22, before taking the
  measures provided for therein, or, as soon as possible in cases to
  which paragraph 3 (d) of this Article applies, the Party in question
  shall supply the Joint Committee with all relevant information
  required for a thorough examination of the situation with a view to
  seeking a solution acceptable to the Parties.

  In the selection of appropriate measures, priority must be given to
  those which least disturb the functioning of the Agreement.

  The safeguard measures shall be notified immediately to the Joint
  Committee and shall be the subject of periodic consultations within
  that Committee, particularly with a view to their abolition as soon as
  circumstances permit.

  3. For the implementation of paragraph 2, the following provisions
  shall apply:

  (a) As regards Article 20, the exporting Party shall be informed of
  the dumping case as soon as the authorities of the importing Party
  have initiated an investigation. When no end has been put to the
  dumping within the meaning of Article VI of GATT or no other
  satisfactory solution has been reached within 30 days of the
  notification being made, the importing Party may adopt the appropriate
  measures.

  (b) As regards Article 21, the difficulties arising from the situation
  referred to in that Article shall be referred for examination to the
  Joint Committee, which may take any decision needed to put an end to
  such difficulties.

  If the Joint Committee or the exporting Party has not taken a decision
  putting an end to the difficulties or no other satisfactory solution
  has been reached within 30 days of the matter being referred, the
  importing Party may adopt the appropriate measures to remedy the
  problem. These measures shall not exceed the scope of what is
  necessary to remedy the difficulties which have arisen.

  (c) As regards Article 22, the difficulties arising from the
  situations referred to in that Article shall be referred for
  examination to the Joint Committee.

  The Committee may take any decision needed to put an end to the
  difficulties. If it has not taken such a decision within 30 days of
  the matter being referred to it, the exporting Party may apply
  appropriate measures on the exportation of the product concerned.

  (d) Where exceptional circumstances requiring immediate action make
  prior information or examination, as the case may be, impossible, the
  Party concerned may, in the situations specified in Articles 20, 21
  and 22 apply forthwith such precautionary measures as are strictly
  necessary to remedy the situation, and shall inform the other Party
  immediately.</article>
      <article number="ARTICLE 24" article_identifier="9628">Nothing in this Agreement shall preclude prohibitions or restrictions
  on imports, exports or goods in transit justified on grounds of public
  morality, public policy or public security, of the protection of
  health and life of humans, animals or plants, of the protection of
  national treasures possessing artistic, historic or archaeological
  value, of the protection of intellectual, industrial and commercial
  property or of regulations concerning gold and silver. Such
  prohibitions or restrictions shall not, however, constitute a means of
  arbitrary discrimination or a disguised restriction on trade between
  the Parties.</article>
      <article number="ARTICLE 25" article_identifier="9629">The concept of 'originating products` for the application of the
  provisions of the present Title and the methods of administrative
  cooperation relating to them are set out in Protocol 3. The Joint
  Committee may decide to make the necessary adaptations to this
  Protocol with a view to the implementation of cumulation of origin as
  agreed in the Declaration adopted at the Barcelona Conference.</article>

  the GATT and Articles VIII and XIV of the Articles of Agreement of the
  International Monetary Fund, adopt restrictions on current
  transactions which shall be of limited duration and may not go beyond

  Community or the Palestinian Authority, as the case may be, shall
  inform the other Party forthwith and shall submit to it as soon as
  possible a timetable for the elimination of the measures concerned.</article>

      <article number="ARTICLE 30" article_identifier="9634">1. The following are incompatible with the proper functioning of the
  Agreement, insofar as they may affect trade between the Community and
  the Palestinian Authority:

  (i) all agreements between undertakings, decisions by associations of
  undertakings and concerted practices between undertakings which have
  as their object or effect the prevention, restriction or distortion of
  competition;

  (ii) abuse by one or more undertakings of a dominant position in the
  territories of the Community or the West Bank and the Gaza Strip as a
  whole or in a substantial part thereof;

  (iii) any public aid which distorts or threatens to distort
  competition by favouring certain undertakings or the production of
  certain goods.

  2. The Parties shall, as appropriate, assess any practice contrary to
  this Article on the basis of the criteria resulting from the
  application of Community competition rules.

  3. The Joint Committee shall, before 31 December 2001, adopt by
  decision the necessary rules for the implementation of paragraphs 1
  and 2.

  Until these rules are adopted, the provisions of the Agreement on
  Subsidies and Countervailing Measures shall be applied as the rules
  for the implementation of paragraph 1 (iii) and the relevant parts of
  paragraph 2.

  4. As regards the implementation of paragraph 1 (iii), the Parties
  recognize that the Palestinian Authority may wish to use, during the
  period until 31 December 2001, public aid to undertakings as an
  instrument to tackle its specific development problems.

  5. Each Party shall ensure transparency in the area of public aid,
  inter alia by reporting annually to the other Party on the total
  amount and the distribution of the aid given and by providing, upon
  request, information on aid schemes. Upon request by one Party, the
  other Party shall provide information on particular individual cases
  of public aid.

  6. With regard to products referred to in Title I, Chapter 2:

  - paragraph 1 (iii) does not apply,

  - any practices contrary to paragraph 1 (i) shall be assessed
  according to the criteria established by the Community on the basis of
  Articles 42 and 43 of the Treaty establishing the European Community
  and in particular those established in Council Regulation No 26/62.

  7. If the Community or the Palestinian Authority considers that a
  particular practice is incompatible with the terms of paragraph 1 of
  this Article, and:

  - is not adequately dealt with under the implementing rules referred
  to in paragraph 3, or

  - in the absence of such rules, and if such practice causes or
  threatens to cause serious prejudice to the interest of the other
  Party or material injury to its domestic industry, including its
  services industry,

  it may take appropriate measures after consultation within the Joint
  Committee or after 30 working days following referral for such
  consultation.

  With reference to practices incompatible with paragraph 1 (iii) of
  this Article, such appropriate measures, when the GATT is applicable
  to them, may only be adopted in accordance with the procedures and
  under the conditions laid down by GATT or by any other relevant
  instrument negotiated under its auspices and applicable between the
  Parties.

  8. Notwithstanding any provisions to the contrary adopted in
  accordance with paragraph 3, the Parties shall exchange information
  taking into account the limitations imposed by the requirements of
  professional and business secrecy.</article>
      <article number="ARTICLE 31" article_identifier="9635">The Member States and the Palestinian Authority shall progressively
  adjust, without prejudice to their commitments to the GATT where
  appropriate, any State monopolies of a commercial character, so as to
  ensure that, by 31 December 2001, no discrimination regarding the
  conditions under which goods are procured and marketed exists between
  nationals of the Member States and the Palestinian people of the West
