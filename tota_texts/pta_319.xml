In the pursuit of this objective, particular regard will be had to the need to secure effective additional benefits for the trade of the ACP States with the Community, in order to accelerate the growth of their trade and in particular of the flow of their exports to the Community and in order to improve the conditions of access for their products to the market of the Community, so as to ensure a better balance in the trade of the Contracting Parties. 

To this end the Contracting Parties shall apply the provisions of this Title and the other appropriate measures under Titles V, VI and VII.</article>

mon organization of the market within the meaning of Article 40 of the Treaty, or -subject, on import into the Community, to specific rules intro

duced as a result of the implementation of the common agricul
tural policy, 
shall be imported into the Community notwithstanding the gen
eral arrangements applied in respect of third countries, in accord
ance with the following provisions: 



(i) those products shall be imported free of customs duties for 
which Community provisions in force at the time of importation 
do not provide, apart from customs duties, for the application of 
any other measure relating to their import; 



(ii) for products other than those referred to under (i), the Com
munity shall take the necessary measures to ensure more favour
able treatment than that granted to third countries benefiting 
from the most-favoured-nation clause for the same products. 



(b) If, during the application of this Convention, the ACP States 
request that new lines of agricultural production or agricultural 
products which are not the subject of specific arrangements upon 
the entry into force of this Convention should benefit from such 
arrangements, the Community shall examine these requests in 
consultation with the ACP States. 



(c) The arrangements referred to in subparagraph (a) shall enter 
into force at the same time as this Convention and shall remain 
applicable for its duration.

In such cases, the provisions of subparagraph (a) shall be applicable;
