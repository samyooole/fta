22. If, in two or more verifications of origin, two or more written decisions were made denying preferential tariff treatment to goods same as the good subject to verification, it shall be considered that an exporter or a producer has certified or provided information more than once in a false or unfounded manner stating that a good imported to the territory of a Party qualifies as originating 


23. When the competent authority of the importing Party determines that a good imported into its territory does not qualify as originating, according to the tariff classification or the value applied by the Party to one or more materials used in the 

production of the good, and it differs from the tariff classification or from the value applied to the materials by the Party from where the good was exported,that Partyshall provide that its decision shall not take effects until it is notified in writing to the importer of the goods and to the person who has filled in and signed the Certificate of Origin, as well as to the producer of the good. 

24. A Party shall not apply a decision issued under paragraph 23 to an importation made before the effective date of the decision where: 


(a) 	the customs authority of the Party from whose territory the good was exported has issued a decision on the tariff classification or on the value of such materials, on which a person is entitled to rely; and 


(b) 	the mentioned decisions were given prior to the initiation of origin verification.</article>

(a) 	the dumping margin is de minimis when it is less than 6%, expressed as a percentage of the export price; 


(b) 	the amount of the subsidy is de minimis when it is less than 6% ad valorem; and 


(c) 	the volume of the dumped or subsidized imports is insignificant if it represents less than 6% of the total imports of the like products of the importing Party. 

3. An applicant may, at any time, withdraw its investigation request. Once a request for withdrawal is filed after the investigation has been initiated, the competent authority shall notify the rest of the applicants for the purpose of exerting their right of concurrence. If the applicants who disagree with the withdrawal do not represent a percentage of the national production necessary to initiate an investigation, then the investigation shall be terminated and the interested parties will be notified. The investigation may not be continued on the competent authority’s own motion under any circumstance.
