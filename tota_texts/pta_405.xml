2. Bilateral safeguard measures shall only be taken upon clear evidence that increased imports have caused or are threatening to cause serious injury pursuant to an investigation in accordance with the procedures laid down in the WTO Agreement on Safeguards mutatis mutandis.

4. If the conditions set out in paragraph 1 are met, the importing Party may take measures consisting in: 




(a) suspending the further reduction of any rate of customs duty provided for under this Agreement for the product; or

(i) the MFN rate of duty applied at the time the action is taken; or 



(ii) the MFN rate of duty applied on the day immediately preceding the date of the entry into force of this Agreement. 



5. Bilateral safeguard measures shall be taken for a period not exceeding two years. In very exceptional circumstances, after review by the Joint Committee, measures may be taken up to a total maximum period of three years.

6. The Joint Committee shall, within 30 days from the date of notification referred to in paragraph 3, examine the information provided in order to facilitate a mutually acceptable resolution of the matter. In the absence of such resolution, the importing Party may adopt a measure pursuant to paragraph 4 to remedy the problem. In the selection of the bilateral safeguard measure, priority must be given to the measure which least disturbs the functioning of this Agreement. The bilateral safeguard measure shall be immediately notified to the other Parties and the Joint Committee and shall be subject to periodic consultations in the Joint Committee, particularly with a view to establishing a timetable for their abolition as soon as circumstances permit. 



7. Upon the termination of the bilateral safeguard measure, the rate of customs duty shall be the rate which would have been in effect but for the measure. 



8. In critical circumstances, where delay would cause damage which would be difficult to repair, a Party may take a provisional bilateral safeguard measure pursuant to a preliminary determination that there is clear evidence that increased imports constitute a substantial cause of serious injury, or threat thereof, to the domestic industry. The Party intending to take such a measure shall immediately notify in writing the other Parties and the Joint Committee thereof. Within 30 days of the date of the notification, the procedures set out in paragraphs 2 to 6, shall be initiated. 



9. Any provisional bilateral safeguard measures shall be terminated within 200 days at the latest. The period of application of any such provisional bilateral safeguard measure shall be counted as part of the duration of the bilateral safeguard measure set out in paragraph 5 and any extension thereof. Any tariff increases shall be promptly refunded if the investigation described in paragraph 2 does not result in a finding that the conditions of paragraph 1 are met. 



10. Five years after the date of entry into force of this Agreement, the Parties shall review in the Joint Committee whether there is need to maintain the possibility to take bilateral safeguard measures between them. If the Parties decide, after the first review, to maintain such possibility, they shall thereafter conduct biennial reviews of this matter in the Joint Committee.</article>
      <article number="ARTICLE 23" name="Shortage Clause" article_identifier="34378">1. Where compliance with the provisions of this Chapter leads to: 



(a) a critical shortage, or threat thereof, of foodstuffs or other products essential to the exporting Party; or 



(b) re-export to a third country of a product against which the exporting Party maintains quantitative export restrictions, export duties or measures or charges having equivalent effect, and where this gives rise, or is likely to give rise to major difficulties for the exporting Party, 



that Party may take appropriate measures under the conditions and in accordance with the procedures laid down in the following paragraphs of this Article. 



2. Before taking the measures provided for in paragraph 1 the Party considering taking such measures shall supply the Joint Committee with all relevant information, with a view to seeking a solution acceptable to the Parties. The Parties within the Joint Committee may agree on any means needed to put an end to the difficulties. If no agreement is reached within 30 days of the matter being referred to the Joint Committee, the exporting Party may apply measures under this Article on the exportation of the product concerned. 



3. In the selection of measures, priority shall be given to those which least disturb the functioning of the arrangements in this Agreement. Such measures shall not be applied in a manner which would constitute a means of arbitrary or unjustifiable discrimination where the same conditions prevail, or a disguised restriction on trade and shall be eliminated when the conditions no longer justify their maintenance. 



4. Any measure applied pursuant to this Article shall be immediately notified to the Joint Committee and shall be subject to periodic consultations within it, in particular with a view to their elimination as soon as circumstances permit.</article>

Disputes between the Parties relating to the interpretation of rights and obligations under this Agreement, which have not been settled through direct consultations or in the Joint Committee within 60 days from the date of the receipt of the request for consultations, may be referred to arbitration by the complaining Party by means of a written request to the Party complained against. A copy of this request shall be communicated to all other Parties so that they may determine whether to participate in the arbitration. 



2. Where more than one Party requests the establishment of an arbitration panel relating to the same matter, or where the request involves more than one Party complained against, a single arbitration panel should, whenever feasible, be established to consider such disputes.3 

3 For the purpose of this Chapter, the terms “Party” and “Party to the dispute” are used regardless of whether two or more Parties are involved in a dispute. 
3. A Party that is not a party to the dispute shall be entitled, on delivery of a written request to the parties to the dispute, to make written submissions to the arbitration panel, 

receive written submissions, including annexes, from the parties to the dispute, attend hearings and make oral statements. 



4. The arbitration panel shall comprise three members, who shall be nominated in accordance with the Optional Rules for Arbitrating Disputes between Two States of the Permanent Court of Arbitration, effective 20 October 1992 (hereinafter referred to as the “Optional Rules”). If a member of the arbitration panel fails to participate in the arbitration, the other members shall, unless a party to the dispute requests otherwise, have the discretion to continue the arbitration and to render any ruling notwithstanding the failure of one member to participate. 



5. The arbitration panel shall examine the matter referred to it in the request for the establishment of an arbitration panel in light of the provisions of this Agreement applied and interpreted in accordance with the rules of interpretation of public international law. The ruling of the arbitration panel shall be final and binding upon the parties to the dispute. Any ruling of the arbitration panel shall be made public, unless the parties to the dispute agree otherwise. 



6. The language of any proceedings shall be English. The hearings of the arbitration panel shall be open to the public unless the parties to the dispute agree otherwise. Each Party shall treat as confidential the information submitted by any other Party to the arbitration panel which that Party has designated as confidential. 



7. There shall be no ex parte communications with the arbitration panel concerning matters under its consideration. 



8. The ruling of the arbitration panel shall be rendered within 180 days of the date on which the presiding arbitrator of the arbitration panel was appointed. This period may be extended by a maximum of 90 days, if the parties to the dispute so agree. 



9. The costs of arbitration, including the remuneration of the members of the arbitration panel, shall be borne by the parties to the dispute in equal shares.

10. Unless otherwise specified in this Agreement or agreed between the parties to the dispute, the Optional Rules shall apply. 



11. Disputes regarding the same matter arising under both this Agreement and the WTO Agreement may be settled in either forum at the discretion of the complaining party. The forum thus selected shall be used to the exclusion of the other. For the purpose of this paragraph, dispute settlement proceedings under the WTO Agreement or this Agreement are deemed to be initiated upon a request for the establishment of a panel by a Party. Before a Party initiates dispute settlement proceedings under the WTO Understanding on Rules and Procedures Governing the Settlement of Disputes against another Party regarding a matter arising under both this Agreement and the WTO Agreement, that Party shall notify all other Parties of its intention to do so.</article>
      <article number="ARTICLE 46" name="Implementation Of The Ruling" article_identifier="34401">1. The Party complained against shall promptly comply with the ruling of the arbitration panel. If it is impracticable to comply immediately, the parties to the dispute shall endeavour to agree on a reasonable period of time to do so. In the absence of such agreement within 30 days from the date of the ruling, either party to the dispute may, within 10 days from the expiration of such period, request the original arbitration panel to determine the length of the reasonable period of time. 



2. The Party concerned shall notify in writing the other party to the dispute of the measure adopted in order to implement the ruling. 



3. If the Party concerned fails to comply with the ruling within a reasonable period of time and the parties to the dispute have not agreed on any compensation, the other party to the dispute may, until the ruling has been properly implemented or the dispute has been otherwise resolved, and subject to a prior notification of 30 days, suspend the application of benefits granted under this Agreement, but only equivalent to those affected by the measure that the arbitration panel has found to violate this Agreement. 



4. Any dispute regarding the implementation of the ruling or the notified suspension shall be decided by the original arbitration panel upon request of either party to the dispute before suspension of benefits can be applied. The arbitration panel may also rule on the conformity with the ruling of any implementing measures adopted after the suspension of benefits and whether the suspension of benefits should be terminated or modified. The ruling of the arbitration panel under this paragraph shall normally be given within 45 days from the date of receipt of the request.</article>
