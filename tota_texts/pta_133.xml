If agreement cannot be reached between the participating countries concerned within six months from the end of the three-year period referred to· in paragraph 7 or from tile" date on whfoh the authorization pursuant to paragraph 8 has been granted, as may be the case, the participating country seeking renegotiation shall nevertheless be free within ninety days therefrom, upon notification to the Committee, to modify or withdraw the subject concession.

Where, however, restrictions are instituted or intensified with respect to products covered by concessions, immediate notice of such action must be given to the . Committee and such action may be the subject of consultations as provided for in paragraph 12.</article>
      <article number="12" name="Consultations" article_identifier="11420">Each participating country shall accord sympathetic consideration to, and shall afford adequate opportunity for, consultation regarding such representations as may be made by another participating country with respect to any matter affecting the operation of this Protocol. The CommittP.e may, at the request of a participating country, consult with any participating country or countries in respect of any matter for which it has not been possible to find a satisfactory solution through such consultation. 

In addition, if any participating country should consider that another participating country has altered the value of a concession embodied in its schedule or that any benefit accruing to it directly or indirectly under this Protocol is being nullified or impaired as the result of the failure of another participating country to carry out any of its obligations under this Protocol or as the result of any other circumstance relevant to the operation of this Protocol, the former may, with a view to the satisfactory adjustment of the matter, make written representations or proposals to the other participating country or countries which it considers to be concerned, which thus approached shall give sympathetic consideration to the representations or proposals made to it.

Before taking action pursuant to the foregoing it shall give notice in writing to the Committee as far in advance as may be practicable and shall afford the Committee and the participating countries having a substantial interest as exporters of the product concerned an opportunity to consult with it in respect of the proposed action. In critical circumstances, where delay would cause damage which would be difficult to repair, action may be taken provisionally without prior consultation, on the condition that consultation shall be effected immediately after taking such action. Ifagreement among the participating countries concerned with respect to the action is not reached, the importing country which proposes to take or continue the action shall, upon notification to the Committee, nevertheless, be free to do so; and if such action is taken or continued the affected countries shall then be free to suspend, not later than ninety days after notice ofsuch action is received by the Committee, and upon the expiration of thirty days from the date of receipt of such notice, the application to the trade of the country taking such action, of such substantially equivalent concessions, the suspension of which the Committee does not disapprove. Nonetheless, where action is taken without prior consultation and causes or threatens serious injury in the territory of a country to the domestic producers of products affected by the action, that country shall, where delay would cause damage difficult to repair, be free to suspend, upon the taking of the action and throughout the period of consultation, such concessions or other obligations as may be necessary to prevent or remedy the injury.</article>

DECLARATION 

Taking into account the objectives set out in the Preamble, the parties to this Protocol are agreed that the implementation of commitments under customs unions or free-trade areas among developing countries shall not be affected by the provisions of paragraph 12 of this Protocol. Where, however, in implementing these commitments a party to this Protocol increases a rate of duty bound in the schedules annexed to this Protocol, the provisions of paragraphs 8 and 9 shall apply. 

It is the intention of parties to this Protocol which participate in such customs unions or free-trade areas to use their best endeavours to ensure that such agreements shall not, by virtue of their provisions governing treatment applicable in respect of third countries, prevent the implementation of the provisions of this Protocol and the attainment of its objectives.
