(c) 	base its determination of whether a supplier has satisfied the conditions for participation solely on the conditions that it has specified in advance in notices or tender documentation; and

(d) 	for goods purchased on a commodity market; 


(e) 	where a procuring entity procures a prototype or a first good or service that is developed at its request in the course of, and for, a particular contract for research, experiment, study, or original development.

4. In order to ensure that no hierarchy is established between rights of authors, on the one hand, and rights of performers and producers of phonograms, on the other hand, each Party shall provide that in cases where authorization is needed from both the author of a work embodied in a phonogram and a performer or producer owning rights in the phonogram, the need for the authorization of the author does not cease to exist because the authorization of the performer or producer is also required.  Likewise, each Party shall establish that in cases where authorization is needed from both the author of a work embodied in a phonogram and a performer or producer owning rights in the phonogram, the need for the authorization of the performer or producer does not cease to exist because the authorization of the author is also required. 


5. Each Party shall provide that, where the term of protection of a work (including a photographic work), performance, or phonogram is to be calculated: 


(a) 	on the basis of the life of a natural person, the term shall be not less than the life of the author and 70 years after the author’s death; and

(a) 

In order to provide adequate legal protection and effective legal 




remedies against the circumvention of effective technological 




measures that authors, performers, and producers of phonograms use 




in connection with the exercise of their rights and that restrict 




unauthorized acts in respect of their works, performances, and 




phonograms, each Party shall provide that any person who:

In civil judicial proceedings concerning the enforcement of intellectual property rights, each Party shall provide that its judicial authorities shall have the authority to order a party to desist from an infringement, in order, inter alia, to prevent, immediately after they clear customs, the entry into the channels of commerce in the jurisdiction of those authorities of imported goods that involve the infringement of an intellectual property right, or to prevent their exportation. 


16. In the event that a Party’s judicial or other authorities appoint technical or other experts in civil proceedings concerning the enforcement of intellectual property rights and require that the parties to the litigation bear the costs of such experts, the Party should seek to ensure that such costs are closely related, inter alia, to the quantity and nature of work to be performed and do not unreasonably deter recourse to such proceedings.

Special Requirements Related to Border Measures 


20. Each Party shall provide that any right holder initiating procedures for its competent authorities to suspend release of suspected counterfeit or confusingly similar trademark goods, or pirated copyright goods19 into free circulation is required to provide adequate evidence to satisfy the competent authorities that, under the laws of the country of importation, there is prima facie an infringement of the right holder’s intellectual property right and to supply sufficient information that may reasonably be expected to be within the right holder’s knowledge to make the suspected goods reasonably recognizable by its competent authorities.  The requirement to provide sufficient information shall not unreasonably deter recourse to these procedures. Each Party shall provide that the application to suspend the release of goods shall remain in force for a period of not less than one year from the date of application, or the period that the good is protected by copyright or the relevant trademark registration, whichever is shorter. 


21. Each Party shall provide that its competent authorities shall have the authority to require a right holder initiating procedures to suspend the release of suspected counterfeit or confusingly similar trademark goods, or pirated copyright goods, to provide a reasonable security or equivalent assurance sufficient to protect the defendant and the competent authorities and to prevent abuse.  Each Party shall provide that such security or equivalent assurance shall not unreasonably deter recourse to these procedures.  Each Party may provide that such security may be in the form of a bond conditioned to hold the importer or owner of the imported merchandise harmless from any loss or damage resulting from any suspension of 
19 For purposes of paragraphs 20 through 25: 


(a) 	counterfeit trademark goods means any goods, including packaging, bearing without authorization a trademark that is identical to the trademark validly registered in respect of such goods, or that cannot be distinguished in its essential aspects from such a trademark, and that thereby infringes the rights of the owner of the trademark in question under the law of the country of importation; and 


(b) 	pirated copyright goods means any goods that are copies made without the consent of the right holder or person duly authorized by the right holder in the country of production and which are made directly or indirectly from an article where the making of that copy would have constituted an infringement of a copyright or a related right under the law of the country of importation. 
15-29 


the release of goods in the event the competent authorities determine that the article is not an infringing good. 


22. Where its competent authorities have made a determination that goods are counterfeit or pirated, a Party shall grant its competent authorities the authority to inform the right holder of the names and addresses of the consignor, the importer, and the consignee, and of the quantity of the goods in question. 


23. Each Party shall provide that its competent authorities may initiate border measures ex officio, with respect to imported, exported, or in-transit merchandise suspected of infringing an intellectual property right, without the need for a formal complaint from a private party or right holder.   


24. Each Party shall provide that goods that have been determined to be pirated or counterfeit by its competent authorities shall be destroyed, except in exceptional circumstances.  In regard to counterfeit trademark goods, the simple removal of the trademark unlawfully affixed shall not be sufficient to permit the release of the goods into the channels of commerce.  In no event shall the competent authorities be authorized, except in exceptional circumstances, to permit the exportation of counterfeit or pirated goods or to permit such goods to be subject to other customs procedures. 


25. Where an application fee or merchandise storage fee is assessed in connection with border measures to enforce an intellectual property right, each Party shall provide that such fee shall not be set at an amount that unreasonably deters recourse to these measures. 
Criminal Procedures and Remedies 

26. 	(a) Each Party shall provide for criminal procedures and penalties to be applied at least in cases of willful trademark counterfeiting or copyright or related rights piracy on a commercial scale.  Willful copyright or related rights piracy on a commercial scale includes 


(i) 	significant willful copyright or related rights infringements that have no direct or indirect motivation of financial gain, and 


(ii) 	willful infringements for purposes of commercial advantage or private financial gain. 
15-30 


Each Party shall treat willful importation or exportation of counterfeit or pirated goods as unlawful activities subject to criminal penalties to the same extent as the trafficking or distribution of such goods in domestic commerce. 

(b) 	Specifically, each Party shall provide: 


(i) 	remedies that include sentences of imprisonment as well as monetary fines sufficient to provide a deterrent to future infringements, consistent with a policy of removing the infringer’s monetary incentive, and shall further establish policies or guidelines that encourage judicial authorities to impose those remedies at levels sufficient to provide a deterrent to future infringements;  


(ii) 	that its judicial authorities shall have the authority to order the seizure of suspected counterfeit or pirated goods, any related materials and implements used in the commission of the offense, any assets traceable to the infringing activity, and any documentary evidence relevant to the offense.  Each Party shall provide that items that are subject to seizure pursuant to any such judicial order need not be individually identified, so long as they fall within general categories specified in the order; 
(iii) 	that its judicial authorities shall have the authority, among other measures, to order the forfeiture of any assets traceable to the infringing activity and shall, except in exceptional cases, order the forfeiture and destruction of all counterfeit or pirated goods, and, at least with respect to willful copyright or related rights piracy, order the forfeiture and destruction of materials and implements that have been used in the creation of infringing goods. Each Party shall further 

15-31 


provide that such forfeiture and destruction shall occur without compensation of any kind to the defendant; and 

(iv) 	that its authorities may initiate legal action ex officio with respect to the offenses described in this Chapter, without the need for a formal complaint by a private party or right holder. 

27. Each Party shall also provide for criminal procedures and penalties to be applied in the following cases, even absent willful trademark counterfeiting or copyright piracy: 


(a) 	knowing trafficking in counterfeit labels affixed or designed to be affixed to: a phonogram, a copy of a computer program, documentation or packaging for a computer program, or a copy of a motion picture or other audiovisual work; and  


(b) 	knowing trafficking in counterfeit documentation or packaging for a computer program.  
Limitations on Liability for Service Providers 

28. For the purpose of providing enforcement procedures that permit effective action against any act of copyright infringement covered by this Chapter, including expeditious remedies to prevent infringements and criminal and civil remedies, each Party shall provide, consistent with the framework set out in this Article: 


(a) 	legal incentives for service providers to cooperate with copyright20 owners in deterring the unauthorized storage and transmission of copyrighted materials; and 


(b) 	limitations in its law regarding the scope of remedies available against service providers for copyright infringements that they do not control, initiate, or direct, and that take place through systems or 
20 For purposes of this paragraph, “copyright” includes related rights. 

15-32 


networks controlled or operated by them or on their behalf, as set forth in this subparagraph.21 


(i) 	These limitations shall preclude monetary relief, and provide reasonable restrictions on court-ordered relief to compel or restrain certain actions, for the following functions, and shall be confined to those functions:22 


(A) 	transmitting, routing, or providing connections for material without modification of its content, or the intermediate and transient storage of such material in the course thereof; 


(B) 	caching carried out through an automatic process; 


(C) 	storage at the direction of a user of material residing on a system or network controlled or operated by or for the service provider; and 


(D) 	referring or linking users to an online location by using information location tools, including hyperlinks and directories. 

(ii) 	These limitations shall apply only where the service provider does not initiate the chain of transmission of the material and does not select the material or its recipients (except to the extent that a function described in clause (i)(D) in itself entails some form of selection). 
(iii) 	Qualification by a service provider for the limitations as to each function in clause (i)(A) through (D) shall be 

21 This subparagraph is without prejudice to the availability of defenses to copyright infringement that are of general applicability.  

22 Either Party may request consultations with the other Party to consider how to address under this paragraph functions of a similar nature that a Party identifies after the date of entry into force of this Agreement. 

15-33 


considered separately from qualification for the limitations as to each other function, in accordance with the conditions for qualification set forth in clauses (iv) through (vii).  


(iv) 	With respect to functions referred to in clause (i)(B), the limitations shall be conditioned on the service provider:  


(A) 	permitting access to cached material in significant part only to users of its system or network who have met conditions on user access to that material; 


(B) 	complying with rules concerning the refreshing, reloading, or other updating of the cached material when specified by the person making the material available online in accordance with a generally accepted industry standard data communications protocol for the system or network through which that person makes the material available; 


(C) 	not interfering with technology consistent with industry standards accepted in the Party’s territory used at the originating site to obtain information about the use of the material, and not modifying its content in transmission to subsequent users; and 


(D) 	expeditiously removing or disabling access, on receipt of an effective notification of claimed infringement, to cached material that has been removed or access to which has been disabled at the originating site. 

(v) 	With respect to functions referred to in clause (i)(C) and (D), the limitations shall be conditioned on the service provider: 


(A) 	not receiving a financial benefit directly attributable to the infringing activity, in circumstances where it has the right and ability to control such activity; 


(B) 	expeditiously removing or disabling access to the material residing on its system or network on obtaining actual knowledge of the infringement or becoming aware of facts or circumstances from which the infringement was apparent, such as through effective notifications of claimed infringement in accordance with clause (ix);and 


(C) 	publicly designating a representative to receive such notifications. 

(vi) 	Eligibility for the limitations in this subparagraph shall be conditioned on the service provider: 


(A) 	adopting and reasonably implementing a policy that provides for termination in appropriate circumstances of the accounts of repeat infringers; and   


(B) 	accommodating and not interfering with standard technical measures accepted in the Party’s territory that protect and identify copyrighted material, that are developed through an open, voluntary process by a broad consensus of copyright owners and service providers, that are available on reasonable and nondiscriminatory terms, and that do not impose substantial costs on service providers or substantial burdens on their systems or networks. 
15-34 

(vii) 	Eligibility for the limitations in this subparagraph may not be conditioned on the service provider monitoring its service, or affirmatively seeking facts indicating infringing activity, except to the extent consistent with such technical measures. 

(viii) 	If the service provider qualifies for the limitations with respect to the function referred to in clause (i)(A), court-ordered relief to compel or restrain certain actions shall be 

15-35 limited to terminating specified accounts, or to taking reasonable steps to block access to a specific, non-domestic online location. If the service provider qualifies for the limitations with respect to any other function in clause (i), court-ordered relief to compel or restrain certain actions shall be limited to removing or disabling access to the infringing material, terminating specified accounts, and other remedies that a court may find necessary, provided that such other remedies are the least burdensome to the service provider among comparably effective forms of relief.  Each Party shall provide that any such relief shall be issued with due regard for the relative burden to the service provider and harm to the copyright owner, the technical feasibility and effectiveness of the remedy and whether less burdensome, comparably effective enforcement methods are available.  Except for orders ensuring the preservation of evidence, or other orders having no material adverse effect on the operation of the service provider’s communications network, each Party shall provide that such relief shall be available only where the service provider has received notice of the court order proceedings referred to in this subparagraph and an opportunity to appear before the judicial authority. 


(ix) 	For purposes of the notice and take down process for the functions referred to in  clauses (i)(C) and (D), each Party shall establish appropriate procedures for effective notifications of claimed infringement, and effective counter-notifications by those whose material is removed or disabled through mistake or misidentification.  Each Party shall also provide for monetary remedies against any person who makes a knowing material misrepresentation in a notification or counter-notification that causes injury to any interested party as a result of a service provider relying on the misrepresentation.  


(x) 	If the service provider removes or disables access to material in good faith based on claimed or apparent infringement, 
15-36 each Party shall provide that the service provider shall be exempted from liability for any resulting claims, provided that, in the case of material residing on its system or network, it takes reasonable steps promptly to notify the person making the material available on its system or network that it has done so and, if such person makes an effective counter-notification and is subject to jurisdiction in an infringement suit, to restore the material online unless the person giving the original effective notification seeks judicial relief within a reasonable time.   

(xi) 	Each Party shall establish an administrative or judicial procedure enabling copyright owners who have given effective notification of claimed infringement to obtain expeditiously from a service provider information in its possession identifying the alleged infringer. 

(xii) 	For purposes of the function referred to in clause (i)(A), service provider means a provider of transmission, routing, or connections for digital online communications without modification of their content between or among points specified by the user of material of the user’s choosing, and for purposes of the functions referred to in clause (i)(B) through (D), service provider means a provider or operator of facilities for online services or network access.</article>

5. If the Party complained against fails to pay a monetary assessment, and if the Party has created and funded an escrow account to ensure payment of any assessments against it, the other Party shall, before having recourse to any other measure, seek to obtain the funds from the account. 


6. If the complaining Party cannot obtain the funds from the other Party’s escrow account within 30 days of the date on which payment is due, or if the other Party has not created an escrow account, the complaining Party may take other appropriate steps to collect the assessment or otherwise secure compliance.  These steps may include suspending tariff benefits under the Agreement as necessary to collect the assessment, while bearing in mind the Agreement’s objective of eliminating barriers to bilateral trade and while seeking to avoid unduly affecting parties or interests not party to the dispute.</article>
