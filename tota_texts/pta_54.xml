10 Australia's interconnection regime provides access on terms and conditions which are fair and reasonable to all parties and which do not unfairly discriminate between users. Access rights are guaranteed by legislation and the terms and conditions of access are established primarily through processes of commercial negotiation or by reference to access undertakings given by suppliers of public telecommunications networks or services which may draw upon an industry code of practice. Any code of practice and each supplier's undertaking will be subject to approval by the regulator. 11 In Australia, the rate at which interconnection is provided is determined by negotiation. Both negotiating parties have recourse to the regulator which will make a decision based on transparent criteria to ensure that rates are fair and reasonable in the circumstances. 12 The regulator may resolve any dispute on what costs are relevant in determining rates.

(b) Where the regulator is unable to resolve the disputes referred to in Article 9.8(a) within 180 days, each Party shall ensure that the regulator endeavours to provide interim determinations on the disputes where necessary to ensure that facilities-based suppliers of the other Party are able to interconnect with a major supplier.</article>
