  the Community of an agricultural component on imports of the goods
  originating in Tunisia listed in Annex 1.

  The agricultural component shall reflect differences between the price
  on the Community market of the agricultural products considered as
  being used in the production of such goods and the price of imports
  from third countries where the total cost of the said basic products
  is higher in the Community. The agricultural component may take the
  form of a fixed amount or an ad valorem duty. Such differences shall
  be replaced, where appropriate, by specific duties based on
  tariffication of the agricultural component or by ad valorem duties.

  The provisions of Chapter 2 applicable to agricultural products shall
  apply mutatis mutandis to the agricultural component.

  2. The provisions of this Chapter shall not preclude the separate
  specification by Tunisia of an agricultural component in the import
  duties in force on the products listed in Annex 2 originating in the
  Community. The agricultural component may take the form of a fixed
  amount or an ad valorem duty.

  The provisions of Chapter 2 applicable to agricultural products shall
  apply mutatis mutandis to the agricultural component.

  3. In the case of the products shown in Annex 2, list 1, originating
  in the Community, Tunisia shall apply upon the entry into force of
  this Agreement import duties and charges having equivalent effect no
  greater than those in force on 1 January 1995, within the limits of
  the tariff quotas shown in that list.

  During elimination of the industrial component of the duties pursuant
  to paragraph 4, the level of the duties to be applied in respect of
  the products for which the tariff quotas are to be abolished may not
  be higher than the level of the duties in force on 1 January 1995.

  4. In the case of the products in Annex 2, list 2, originating in the
  Community, Tunisia shall eliminate the industrial component of the
  duties in accordance with the provisions laid down in Article 11 (3)
  of the Agreement in respect of products in Annex 4.

  In the case of the products in Annex 2, lists 1 and 3, originating in
  the Community, Tunisia shall eliminate the industrial component of the
  duties in accordance with the provisions laid down in Article 11 (3)
  of the Agreement in respect of products in Annex 5.

  5. The agricultural components applied pursuant to paragraphs 1 and 2
  may be reduced where, in trade between the Community and Tunisia, the
  charge applicable to a basic agricultural product is reduced or where
  such reductions are the result of mutual concessions relating to
  processed agricultural products.

  6. The reduction referred to in paragraph 5, the list of products
  concerned and, where appropriate, the tariff quotas within which the
  reduction applies shall be established by the Association Council.</article>

      <article number="ARTICLE 12" article_identifier="9276">The provisions of Articles 10, 11 and 19(b) shall not apply to
  products in the list appearing in Annex 6. The arrangements to be
  applied to such products shall be re-examined by the Association
  Council four years after the Agreement's entry into force.</article>
      <article number="ARTICLE 13" article_identifier="9277">The provisions concerning the abolition of customs duties on imports
  shall also apply to customs duties of a fiscal nature.</article>
      <article number="ARTICLE 14" article_identifier="9278">1. Exceptional measures of limited duration which derogate from the
  provisions of Article 11 may be taken by Tunisia in the form of an
  increase or reintroduction of customs duties.

  These measures may only concern infant industries, or certain sectors
  undergoing restructuring or facing serious difficulties, particularly
  where these difficulties produce major social problems.

  Customs duties on imports applicable in Tunisia to products
  originating in the Community introduced by these measures may not
  exceed 25 % ad valorem and shall maintain an element of preference for
  products originating in the Community. The total value of imports of
  the products which are subject to these measures may not exceed 15 %
  of total imports of industrial products from the Community during the
  last year for which statistics are available.

  These measures shall be applied for a period not exceeding five years
  unless a longer duration is authorised by the Association Committee.
  They shall cease to apply at the latest on the expiry of the maximum
  transitional period of twelve years.

  No such measures can be introduced in respect of a product if more
  than three years have elapsed since the elimination of all duties and
  quantitative restrictions or charges or measures having equivalent
  effect concerning that product.

  Tunisia shall inform the Association Committee of any exceptional
  measures it intends to take and, at the request of the Community,
  consultations shall be held on such measures and the sectors to which
  they apply before they are implemented. When taking such measures
  Tunisia shall provide the Committee with a timetable for the
  elimination of the customs duties introduced under this Article. This
  timetable shall provide for a phasing-out of these duties in equal
  annual instalments starting at the latest two years after their
  introduction. The Association Committee may decide on a different
  timetable.

  2. By way of derogation from the fourth subparagraph of paragraph 1,
  the Association Committee may exceptionally, in order to take account
  of the difficulties involved in setting up a new industry, authorise
  Tunisia to maintain the measures already taken pursuant to paragraph 1
  for a maximum period of three years beyond the twelve-year
  transitional period.</article>

  and where the situations referred to above give rise, or are likely to
  give rise, to major difficulties for the exporting Party, that Party

  3. For the implementation of paragraph 2, the following provisions
  shall apply:

  being referred, the importing Party may adopt the appropriate
  measures;

  (b) as regards Article 25, the difficulties arising from the situation

  4. (a) For the purposes of applying the provisions of paragraph 1(c),
  the Parties recognize that during the first five years after the entry

  be assessed taking into account the fact that Tunisia shall be
  regarded as an area identical to those areas of the Community
  described in Article 92(3)(a) of the Treaty establishing the European
  Community.

  During the same period of time, Tunisia may exceptionally, as regards
  ECSC steel products, grant State aid for restructuring purposes
  provided that:

  - it leads to the viability of the recipient firms under normal market
  conditions at the end of the restructuring period,

  rationalising capacity in Tunisia.

  The Association Council shall, taking into account the economic
  situation of Tunisia, decide whether the period should be extended
  every five years.

  6. If the Community or Tunisia considers that a particular practice is
  incompatible with the terms of paragraph 1, and:

  - is not adequately dealt with under the implementing rules referred
  to in paragraph 3, or

  - in the absence of such rules, and if such practice causes or
  threatens to cause serious prejudice to the interest of the other
  Party or material injury to its domestic industry, including its
  services industry,

  it may take appropriate measures after consultation within the
  Association Committee or after 30 working days following referral to
  that Committee.

  In the case of practices incompatible with paragraph 1(c) of this
  Article, such appropriate measures may, where the General Agreement on
  Tariffs and Trade applies thereto, only be adopted in accordance with
  the procedures and under the conditions laid down by the General
  Agreement on Tariffs and Trade and any other relevant instrument
