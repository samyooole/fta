      <article number="ARTICLE D-02" name="Regional Value Content" article_identifier="9452">1. Except as provided in paragraph 5, each Party shall provide that the regional value content of a good shall be calculated, at the choice of the exporter or producer of the good, on the basis of either the transaction value method set out in paragraph 2 or the net cost method set out in paragraph 3. 


2. Each Party shall provide that an exporter or producer may calculate the regional value content of a good on the basis of the following transaction value method: 
TV - VNM 
RVC = -------------- x 100 
TV 


where 

RVC is the regional value content, expressed as a percentage; 

TV is the transaction value of the good adjusted to a F.O.B. basis; and 

VNM is the value of non-originating materials used by the producer in the production of the good.

NC is the net cost of the good; and VNM is the value of non-originating materials used by the producer in the production of the good. 

4. The value of non-originating materials used by the producer in the production of a good shall not, for purposes of calculating the regional value content of the good under paragraph 2  or 3, include the value of non-originating materials used to produce originating materials that are subsequently used in the production of the good2. 


5. Each Party shall provide that an exporter or producer shall calculate the regional value content of a good solely on the basis of the net cost method set out in paragraph 3 where: 


(a) 	there is no transaction value for the good; 


(b) 	the transaction value of the good is unacceptable under Article 1 of the Customs Valuation Code; 


(c) 	the good is sold by the producer to a related person and the volume, by units of quantity, of sales of identical or similar goods to related persons during the six-month period immediately preceding the month in which the good is sold exceeds 85 per cent of the producer's total sales of such goods during that period; 


(d) 	the good is 


(i) 	a motor vehicle, 


(ii) 	identified in Annex D-03.1 and is for use in a motor vehicle, or

(f) 	the good is designated as an intermediate material under paragraph 10 and is subject to a regional value-content requirement. 

6. If an exporter or producer of a good calculates the regional value content of the good on the basis of the transaction value method set out in paragraph 2 and a Party subsequently notifies the exporter or producer, during the course of a verification pursuant to Chapter E (Customs 

Procedures), that the transaction value of the good, or the value of any material used in the production of the good, is required to be adjusted or is unacceptable under Article 1 of the Customs Valuation Code, the exporter or producer may then also calculate the regional value content of the good on the basis of the net cost method set out in paragraph 3. 

7. Nothing in paragraph 6 shall be construed to prevent any review or appeal available under Article E-10 (Review and Appeal) of an adjustment to or a rejection of: 


(a) 	the transaction value of a good; or 


(b) 	the value of any material used in the production of a good. 

8. For purposes of calculating the net cost of a good under paragraph 3, the producer of the good may: 


(a) 	calculate the total cost incurred with respect to all goods produced by that producer, subtract any sales promotion, marketing and after-sales service costs, royalties, shipping and packing costs, and non-allowable interest costs that are included in the total cost of all such goods, and then reasonably allocate the resulting net cost of those goods to the good; 


(b) 	calculate the total cost incurred with respect to all goods produced by that producer, reasonably allocate the total cost to the good, and then subtract any sales promotion, marketing and after-sales service costs, royalties,shipping and packing costs and non-allowable interest costs that are included in the portion of the total cost allocated to the good; or  


(c) 	reasonably allocate each cost that forms part of the total cost incurred with respect to the good so that the aggregate of these costs does not include any sales promotion, marketing and after-sales service costs, royalties, shipping and packing costs, and non-allowable interest costs, provided that the allocation of all such costs is consistent with the provisions regarding the reasonable allocation of costs set out in the Uniform Regulations, established under Article E-11 (Customs Procedures - Uniform Regulations)3.

11. 	The value of an intermediate material shall be: 


(a) 	the total cost incurred with respect to all goods produced by the producer of the good that can be reasonably allocated to that intermediate material; or 


(b) 	the aggregate of each cost that forms part of the total cost incurred with respect to that intermediate material that can be reasonably allocated to that intermediate material. 

12. The value of an indirect material shall be based on the Generally Accepted Accounting Principles applicable in the territory o f the Party in which the good is produced.

NOTES Chapter B 

1. 	A good of a Party may include materials of other countries.  
Chapter C 


1. 	"Goods of the Party" includes goods produced in a province of that Party.  


2. 	For the purpose of Article C-02, a good may refer to an originating good or a good which benefits from tariff elimination under a TPL.  


3. 	This paragraph is not intended to prevent either Party from modifying its tariffs outside this Agreement on goods for which no tariff preference is claimed under this Agreement. This paragraph does not prevent either Party from raising a tariff back to an agreed level in accordance with the phase-out schedule in this Agreement following a unilateral reduction. 


4. 	Paragraphs 1 and 2 of this Article are not intended to prevent either Party from maintaining or increasing a customs duty as may be authorized by any dispute settlement provision of the WTO Agreement or any agreement under the WTO Agreement.  


5. 	Where another form of monetary security is used, it shall not be more burdensome than the bonding requirement referred to in this subparagraph. Where a Party uses a non-monetary form of security, it shall not be more burdensome than existing forms of security used by that Party. 


6. 	This paragraph does not cover goods imported in bond, into foreign-trade zones, or in similar status, that are exported for repair and are not re-imported in bond, into foreign trade zones, or in similar status.  


7. 	For purposes of reference only, descriptions are provided next to the corresponding tariff provision.  


8. 	An operation or process that is part of the production or assembly of an unfinished good into a finished good is not a repair or alteration of the unfinished good; a component of a good is a good that may be subject to repair or alteration.  


9. 	The elimination of the MFN tariff is as follows:  
"a" denotes elimination by November 18, 1996; 

"b" denotes elimination on the date of entry into force of this Agreement; 

"c" denotes elimination not later than January 1, 1999; 

"n.a." denotes that the Item does not exist in the Party's tariff schedule. 


10. Oil Seed Seeds. The following products are mentioned in this Law, but the Price Band System is not applied to them nor have they been subject to this System: 1201.0000; 1202.1000; 1202.2000; 1203.0000; 1204.0000; 1205.0000; 1206.0000; 1207.1000; 1207.2000; 1207.3000; 1207.4000; 1207.5000; 1207.6000; 1207.9100; 1207.9200; 1207.9900.

Annex C-00-B 


1. 	The general provisions of Chapter B (Definitions), Chapter C (Market Access), Chapter D (Rules of Origin) and Chapter F (Emergency Action) are subject to the specific rules for textiles and apparel goods set out in this Annex.  


2. 	For purposes of Sections 3 and 4:  


(a) "increased quantities" is intended to be interpreted more broadly than the standard provided in Article F-01.1, which considers imports "in absolute terms" only. For purposes of these Sections, "increased quantities" is intended to be interpreted in the same manner as this standard is interpreted in the WTO Agreement on Textiles and Clothing; and  


(b) "serious damage" is intended as a less stringent standard than "serious injury" under Article F-01.1. The "serious damage" standard is drawn from the WTO Agreement on Textiles and Clothing. The factors to be considered in determining whether the standard has been met are set out in Section 3.2 and are also drawn from that Agreement. "Serious damage" is to be interpreted in the light of its meaning in that Agreement.  

3. 	In paragraph 5(c), the term "equitable treatment" is intended to have the same meaning as it has in customary practice under the WTO Agreement on Textiles and Clothing. 


4. 	For purposes of this Appendix only, references to U.S. Harmonized System Statistical Provisions are based on the 1992 Harmonized System.  
Chapter D 


1. 	The phrase "specifically describes" is intended solely to prevent Article D-01(d) from being used to qualify a part of another part, where the heading or subheading covers the final good, the part made from the other part and the other part.  


2. 	Article D-02(4) applies to intermediate materials, and VNM in paragraphs 2 and 3 does not include: 


(i) the value of any non-originating materials used by another producer to produce an originating material that is subsequently acquired and used in the production of the good by the producer of the good, and  


(ii) the value of non-originating materials used by the producer to produce an originating self-produced material that is designated by the producer as an intermediate material pursuant to Article D-02(10).</article>
