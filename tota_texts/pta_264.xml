and Co-operation in Europe, the Paris Charter, and in particular the 
principles contained in the final document of the Bonn Conference on 
Economic Co-operation in Europe, 


Recalling the traditional trade and economic links between Finland and 
Lithuania, and taking into account their respective levels of economic 
development,
