  is evidence that the industry is adjusting, provided that the total
  period of application of a safeguard measure, including the period of
  initial application and any extension thereof, shall not exceed four
  years; or

  (c) beyond the expiration of the transition period, except with the
  consent of the other Party.

  elimination of a customs duty under this Agreement, and such imports
  cause serious injury, or threat thereof, to the domestic industry. The
  duration of any provisional measure shall not exceed 200 days, during
  which time the Party shall comply with the requirements of Articles
  3.2.2 and 3.2.3. The Party shall promptly refund any tariff increases

  agreement on trade liberalising compensation within 30 days after the
  consultations begin, the Party whose goods are subject to the
  safeguard measure may suspend the application of substantially
  equivalent concessions to the Party applying the safeguard measure.

  regulations including conformity assessment procedures, except when
  such international standards would be an ineffective or inappropriate
  means for the fulfilment of the legitimate objectives pursued, and
  where international standards have not been used as a basis, to
  explain on request to the other Party the reasons why such standards

  reasonable requests for extending the comment period.

  2. Each Party shall ensure that economic operators and other

  Party of an issue of trade that appears to arise from variations in
  the legislation of the Member States of the European Union that Korea

  legitimate objective.

  2. In particular, the Parties agree that where a Party requires
  mandatory marking or labelling of products:

  (a) the Party shall endeavour to minimise its requirements for marking
  or labelling other than marking or labelling relevant to consumers or

  for fiscal purposes is required, such a requirement shall be
  formulated in a manner that is not more trade restrictive than
  necessary to fulfil a legitimate objective;

  (b) the Party may specify the form of labels or markings, but shall
  not require any prior approval, registration or certification in this
  regard. This provision is without prejudice to the right of the Party
  to require prior approval of the specific information to be provided

  international system of nomenclature accepted by the Parties, this may
  also be used. The simultaneous use of other languages shall not be
  prohibited, provided that, either the information provided in the
  other languages shall be identical to that provided in the specified
  language, or that the information provided in the additional language
  shall not constitute a deceptive statement regarding the product; and

  (e) the Party shall, in cases where it considers that legitimate
  objectives under the TBT Agreement are not compromised thereby,
  endeavour to accept non-permanent or detachable labels, or marking or
  labelling in the accompanying documentation rather than physically
  attached to the product.</article>

  out in the following paragraphs.

  2. CPC [30] 84, the United Nations code used for describing computer
  and related services, covers the basic functions used to provide all
  computer and related services including computer programs defined as
  the sets of instructions required to make computers work and
  communicate (including their development and implementation), data
  processing and storage, and related services, such as consultancy and
  training services for staff of clients. Technological developments
  have led to the increased offering of these services as a bundle or
  package of related services that can include some or all of these
  basic functions. For example, services such as web or domain hosting,
  data mining services and grid computing consist of a combination of
  basic computer services functions respectively.

  3. Computer and related services, regardless of whether they are
  delivered via a network, including the Internet, include all services
  that provide:

  (a) consulting, strategy, analysis, planning, specification, design,
  development, installation, implementation, integration, testing,
  debugging, updating, support, technical assistance or management of or
  for computers or computer systems;

  (b) computer programs plus consulting, strategy, analysis, planning,
  specification, design, development, installation, implementation,
  integration, testing, debugging, updating, adaptation, maintenance,
  support, technical assistance, management or use of or for computer
  programs;

  (c) data processing, data storage, data hosting or database services;

  (d) maintenance and repair services for office machinery and
  equipment, including computers; or

  (e) training services for staff of clients, related to computer
  programs, computers or computer systems, and not elsewhere classified.

  4. Computer and related services enable the provision of other
  services such as banking by both electronic and other means. The
  Parties recognise that there is an important distinction between the
  enabling service such as web-hosting or application hosting and the
  content or core service that is being delivered electronically such as
  banking, and that in such cases the content or core service is not
  covered by CPC 84.

  anti-competitive practices, universal service, individual licences and
  nature of the regulatory authority [31].

  independently of the stevedoring or terminal operator companies. The
  activities covered include the organisation and supervision of:

  (i) the loading/discharging of cargo to/from a ship;

  (ii) the lashing/unlashing of cargo; and

  (iii) the reception/delivery and safekeeping of cargoes before
  shipment or after discharge;

  or through transport of cargoes, whether this service is the main
  activity of the service provider or a usual complement of its main
  activity;

  (d) container station and depot services means activities consisting
  in storing containers in port areas with a view to their
  stuffing/stripping, repairing and making them available for shipments;

  interests of one or more shipping lines or shipping companies, for the
  following purposes:

  (i) marketing and sales of maritime transport and related services,
  from quotation to invoicing, and issuance of bills of lading on behalf
  of the companies, acquisition and resale of the necessary related
  services, preparation of documentation, and provision of business
  information; and

  (ii) acting on behalf of the companies organising the call of the ship
  or taking over cargoes when required.

  3. In view of the existing levels of liberalisation between the
  Parties in international maritime transport:

  (a) the Parties shall apply effectively the principle of unrestricted
  access to the international maritime markets and trades on a
  commercial and non-discriminatory basis; and

  (b) each Party shall grant to ships flying the flag of the other Party
  or operated by service suppliers of the other Party treatment no less
  favourable than that accorded to its own ships with regard to, inter
  alia, access to ports, use of infrastructure and auxiliary maritime
  services of the ports, as well as related fees and charges, customs
  facilities and the assignment of berths and facilities for loading and
  unloading.

  4. In applying these principles, the Parties shall:

  (a) not introduce cargo-sharing arrangements in future bilateral
  agreements with third parties concerning maritime transport services,
  including dry and liquid bulk and liner trade, and not activate such
  cargo-sharing arrangements in case they exist in previous bilateral
  agreements; and

  (b) upon the entry into force of this Agreement, abolish and abstain
  from introducing any unilateral measures and administrative, technical
  and other obstacles which could restrict free and fair competition or
  constitute a disguised restriction or have discriminatory effects on
  the free supply of services in international maritime transport.

  5. Each Party shall permit international maritime service suppliers of
  the other Party to have an establishment in its territory under
  conditions of establishment and operation no less favourable than
  those accorded to its own service suppliers or those of any third
  party, whichever are the better, in accordance with the conditions
  inscribed in its list of commitments.

  6. Each Party shall make available to international maritime transport
  suppliers of the other Party on reasonable and non-discriminatory
  terms and conditions the following services at the port:

  respective territories;

  (b) an administrative process verifying that geographical indications
  identify a good as originating in a territory, region or locality of
  either Party, where a given quality, reputation or other
  characteristic of the good is essentially attributable to its
  geographical origin;

  (c) a requirement that a registered name shall correspond to a
  specific product or products for which a product specification is laid

  (a) the use of any means in the designation or presentation of a good

  good [56] not originating in the place indicated by the geographical
  indication in question, even where the true origin of the good is
  indicated or the geographical indication is used in translation or
  transcription or accompanied by expressions such as "kind",

  producers concerned and that consumers are not misled.

  to protect a geographical indication which is not or ceases to be
  protected in its country of origin or which has fallen into disuse in
  that country.

  appropriate, to a recurring penalty payment where provided for by its
  legislation, the continuation of the alleged infringements of that
  right, or to make such continuation subject to the lodging of
  guarantees intended to ensure the compensation of the right holder. An
  interlocutory injunction may also be issued against an intermediary

  (a) subsidies granted under any legal arrangement whereby a government

  certain enterprises within the meaning of Article 2.1 of the SCM
  Agreement without any limitation, in law or in fact, as to the amount

  contributing itself to the costs of restructuring. This does not
  prevent the Parties from providing subsidies by way of temporary
  liquidity support in the form of loan guarantees or loans limited to
  the amount needed to merely keep an ailing enterprise in business for
  the time necessary to work out a restructuring or liquidation plan.

  [1] For the purposes of this Agreement, goods means products as
  understood in GATT 1994 unless otherwise provided in this Agreement.

  [2] The Parties understand that this definition is without prejudice
  to the treatment that the Parties, in line with the WTO Agreement, may
  accord to trade conducted on a most-favoured-nation basis.

  [3] A Party may require an importer to provide sufficient guarantee in
  the form of a surety, a deposit or some other appropriate instruments,
  covering the ultimate payment of the customs duties, taxes and fees in
  connection with the importation of the goods.

  [4] The sole fact of requiring a visa for natural persons of certain
  countries and not for those of others shall not be regarded as
  nullifying or impairing benefits under the terms of a specific
  commitment in this Chapter and its Annexes.

  [5] Central administration means the head office where ultimate
  decision-making takes place.

  [6] In line with its notification of the Treaty establishing the
  European Community to the WTO (WT/REG39/1), the EU Party understands
  the concept of "effective and continuous link" with the
  economy of a Member State of the European Union enshrined in Article
  48 of the Treaty as equivalent to the concept of "substantive
  business operations" provided for in paragraph 6 of Article V of
  the GATS. Accordingly, for a juridical person set up in accordance
  with the laws of Korea and having only its registered office or
  central administration in the territory of Korea, the EU Party shall
  only extend the benefits of this Agreement if that juridical person
  possesses an effective and continuous link with the economy of Korea.

  [7] This subparagraph shall not apply to establishment.

  [8] The exclusion of audiovisual services from the scope of this
  Section is without prejudice to the rights and obligations derived
  from the Protocol on Cultural Cooperation.

  [9] This subparagraph includes measures which require a service
  supplier of the other Party to have an establishment within the
  meaning of Article 7.9(a) or to be resident in a Party’s territory as
  a condition for the cross-border supply of services.

  [10] This subparagraph does not cover measures of a Party which limit
  inputs for the cross-border supply of services.

  [11] Nothing in this Article shall be interpreted as extending the
  scope of this Section.

  [12] The terms "constitution" and "acquisition" of
  a juridical person shall be understood as including capital
  participation in a juridical person with a view to establishing or
  maintaining lasting economic links.

  [13] Where the economic activity is not performed directly by a
  juridical person but through other forms of establishment such as a
  branch or a representative office, the investor including the
  juridical person shall, nonetheless, through such establishment be
  accorded the treatment provided for investors under this Agreement.
  Such treatment shall be extended to the establishment through which
  the economic activity is performed and need not be extended to any
  other parts of the investor located outside the territory where the
  economic activity is performed.

  [14] Investment protection, other than the treatment deriving from
  Article 7.12, including investor-state dispute settlement procedures,
  is not covered by this Chapter.

  [15] For greater certainty, processing of nuclear materials covers all
  the activities included in the International Standard Industrial
  Classification of all Economic Activities as set out in Statistical
  Office of the United Nations, Statistical Papers, Series M, N 4, ISIC
  REV 3.1, 2002 code 2330.

  [16] War material is limited to any product which is solely intended
  and made for military use in connection with the conduct of war or
  defence activities.

  [17] The exclusion of audiovisual services from the scope of this
  Section is without prejudice to the rights and obligations derived
  from the Protocol on Cultural Cooperation.

  [18] Subparagraphs (a) through (c) do not cover measures taken in
  order to limit the production of an agricultural product.

  [19] This Article applies to measures governing the composition of
  boards of directors of an establishment, such as nationality and
  residency requirements.

  [20] Nothing in this Article shall be interpreted as extending the
  scope of this Section.

  [21] The obligation contained in this paragraph does not extend to the
  investment protection provisions not covered by this Chapter,
  including provisions relating to investor-state dispute settlement
  procedures.

  [22] This includes this Chapter and Annexes 7-A and 7-C.

  [23] The recipient establishment may be required to submit a training
  programme covering the duration of stay for prior approval,
  demonstrating that the purpose of the stay is for training
  corresponding to the level of a university degree.

  [24] The service contract referred to under this subparagraph shall
  comply with the laws, regulations and requirements of the Party where
  the contract is executed.

  [25] The service contract referred to under this subparagraph shall
  comply with the laws, regulations and requirements of the Party where
  the contract is executed.

  [26] A Party may authorise an extension for the period allowed in
  conformity with the laws and regulations in force in its territory.

  [27] This paragraph is without prejudice to the rights and obligations
  deriving from bilateral visa waiver agreements between Korea and one
  of the Member States of the European Union.

  [28] Unless otherwise provided in Annex 7-A, neither Party may require
  that an establishment appoints to senior management positions natural
  persons of any particular nationality or having residency in its
  territory.

  [29] This Article is without prejudice to the rights and obligations
  deriving from bilateral visa waiver agreements between Korea and one
  of the Member States of the European Union.

  [30] CPC means the Central Products Classification as set out in
  Statistical Office of the United Nations, Statistical Papers, Series
  M, No 77, CPC Prov, 1991.

  [31] For greater certainty, nothing in this Article shall be
  interpreted as intending to change the regulatory framework of the
  existing regulatory body in Korea which regulates private delivery
  service suppliers upon the entry into force of this Agreement.

  [32] These include services listed in items from a through g under C.
  Telecommunication Services of 2. Communication Services in the
  MTN/GNS/W/120.

  [33] The scope and implementation of universal services shall be
  decided by each Party.

  [34] Licence fees do not include payments for auction, tendering or
  other non-discriminatory means of awarding concessions, or mandated
  contributions to universal service provision.

  [35] This subparagraph shall take effect no later than five years
  after the entry into force of this Agreement. Each Party shall ensure
  that licence fees are imposed and applied in a non-discriminatory
  manner upon the entry into force of this Agreement.

  [36] Or margin squeeze for the EU Party.

  [37] Each Party will implement this obligation in accordance with its
  relevant legislation.

  [38] For disputes between service suppliers or between service
  suppliers and users, the appeal body shall be independent of the
  parties involved in the dispute.

  [39] Any measure which is applied to financial service suppliers
  established in a Party’s territory that are not regulated and
  supervised by the financial supervisory authority of that Party would
  be deemed to be a prudential measure for the purposes of this
  Agreement. For greater certainty, any such measure shall be taken in
  line with this Article.

  [40] It is understood that the term "prudential reasons" may
  include the maintenance of the safety, soundness, integrity or
  financial responsibility of individual financial service suppliers.

  [41] For greater certainty, this commitment indicates the rights and
  freedoms set out in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, the
  Guidelines for the Regulation of Computerised Personal Data Files
  (adopted by the United General Assembly Resolution 45/95 of 14
  December 1990), and the OECD Guidelines on the Protection of Privacy
  and Transborder Flows of Personal Data (adopted by the OECD Council on
  23 September 1980).

  [42] The inclusion of the provisions on electronic commerce in this
  Chapter is made without prejudice to Korea’s position on whether
  deliveries by electronic means should be categorised as trade in
  services or goods.

  [43] The public order exception may be invoked only where a genuine
  and sufficiently serious threat is posed to one of the fundamental
  interests of society.

  [44] Measures that are aimed at ensuring the equitable or effective
  imposition or collection of direct taxes include measures taken by a
  Party under its taxation system which:(a)apply to non-resident
  investors and service suppliers in recognition of the fact that the
  tax obligation of non-residents is determined with respect to taxable
  items sourced or located in the Party’s territory;(b)apply to
  non-residents in order to ensure the imposition or collection of taxes
  in the Party’s territory;(c)apply to non-residents or residents in
  order to prevent the avoidance or evasion of taxes, including
  compliance measures;(d)apply to consumers of services supplied in or
  from the territory of the other Party in order to ensure the
  imposition or collection of taxes on such consumers derived from
  sources in the Party’s territory;(e)distinguish investors and service
  suppliers subject to tax on worldwide taxable items from other
  investors and service suppliers, in recognition of the difference in
  the nature of the tax base between them; or(f)determine, allocate or
  apportion income, profit, gain, loss, deduction or credit of resident
  persons or branches, or between related persons or branches of the
  same person, in order to safeguard the Party’s tax base.Tax terms or
  concepts in this paragraph and this footnote are determined according
  to tax definitions and concepts, or equivalent or similar definitions
  and concepts, under the domestic law of the Party taking the measure.

  [45] "serious difficulties for the operation of monetary policy
  or exchange rate policy" shall include, but not be limited to,
  serious balance of payments or external financial difficulties, and
  the safeguard measures under this Article shall not apply with respect
  to foreign direct investments.

  [46] In particular, safeguard measures provided for in this Article
  should be applied in such a way that they:(a)are not
  confiscatory;(b)do not constitute a dual or multiple exchange rate
  practice;(c)do not otherwise interfere with investors’ ability to earn
  a market rate of return in the territory of the Party who took
  safeguard measures on any restricted assets;(d)avoid unnecessary
  damage to the commercial, economic or financial interests of the other
  Party;(e)are temporary and phased out progressively as the situation
  calling for imposition of such measures improves; and(f)are promptly
  published by the competent authorities responsible for foreign
  exchange policy.

  [47] The European Union or Member States of the European Union or
  Korea.

  [48] As long as the circumstances present at the time of initial
  adoption of safeguard measures or any equivalent thereto still exist,
  the application of safeguard measures can be extended once for another
  six months by the Party concerned. However, if extremely exceptional
  circumstances arise such that a Party seeks further extension of the
  safeguard measures, it will coordinate in advance with the other Party
  concerning the implementation of any proposed extension.

  [49] Contained in WTO Document negs 268 (Job No[1].8274) dated 19
  November 2007.

  [50] For the purposes of this paragraph, retransmission within a
  Party’s territory over a closed and defined subscriber network that is
  not accessible from outside the Party’s territory does not constitute
  retransmission on the Internet.

  [51] "Geographical indication" in this Sub-section refers
  to:(a)geographical indications, designations of origin, quality wines
  produced in a specified region and table wines with geographical
  indication as referred to in Council Regulation (EC) No 510/2006 of 20

  [55] Spirits within the meaning of this Sub-section are products

  [57] If a proposal is made by:(a)Korea for an originating product
  falling into the scope of the legislation of the European Union set
  out under Article 10.18.2 and footnotes of Article 10.19; or(b)the

  indication originates.

  [60] Korea considers designs not to be new if an identical or similar
  design has been publicly known or publicly worked before the
  application for design registration is filed. Korea considers designs
  not to be original if they could have been easily created from the
  combinations of designs that have been publicly known or publicly
  worked before the application for design registration is filed. The
  European Union considers designs not to be new if an identical design
  has been made available to the public before the filing date of a
  registered design or before the date of disclosure of an unregistered
  design. The European Union considers design not to have individual
  character if the overall impression it produces on the informed users
  does not differ from the overall impression produced on such a user by
  any design which has been made available to the public.

  [61] For the purposes of this Article, the European Union and Korea
  consider that "unregistered design" and "unregistered
  appearance" have a similar meaning. The conditions for protection
  of "unregistered design" or "unregistered
  appearance" are provided for:(a)by Korea in the Unfair
  Competition Prevention and Trade Secret Protection Act (Act No. 8767,
  Dec. 21, 2007); and(b)by the European Union in Council Regulation (EC)
  No 6/2002 of 12 December 2001 on Community designs, as last amended by
  Council Regulation (EC) No 1891/2006 of 18 December 2006.

  [62] For the purposes of this Article, the European Union considers
  "presenting" as "offering" or "putting on the
  market" and Korea considers "presenting" as
  "assigning, leasing or exhibition for assigning or leasing".

  [63] The protection of a design under the law of copyright is not
  granted automatically, but granted only if a design qualifies for
  protection in accordance with the law of copyright.

  [64] As defined in Annex 2-D (Pharmaceutical Products and Medical
  Devices).

  [65] Plant protection products, in the form in which they are supplied
  to the user, consist of or contain active substances, safeners or
  synergists, and are intended for one of the following
  uses:(a)protecting plants or plant products against all harmful
  organisms or preventing the action of such organisms, unless the main
  purpose of these products is considered to be for reasons of hygiene
  rather than for the protection of plants or plant
  products;(b)influencing the life processes of plants, such as
  substances influencing their growth, other than as a
  nutrient;(c)preserving plant products, in so far as such substances or
  products are not subject to the European Union’s special provisions on
  preservatives;(d)destroying undesired plants or parts of plants,
  except algae unless the products are applied on soil or water to
  protect plants; or(e)checking or preventing undesired growth of
  plants, except algae unless the products are applied on soil or water
  to protect plants.

  [66] This is without prejudice to a possible extension for paediatric
  use, if provided for by the Parties.

  [67] As defined in Annex 2-D (Pharmaceutical Products and Medical
  Devices).

  [68] As defined in Article 10.2.2(a) through (h).

  [69] For the purposes of this paragraph, the scope of
  "intermediary" is determined in each Party’s legislation,
  but shall include those who deliver or distribute infringing goods,
  and also where appropriate, include online service providers.

  [70] For the purposes of this paragraph, the scope of
  "intermediary" is determined in each Party’s legislation,
  but shall include those who deliver or distribute infringing goods,
  and also where appropriate, include online service providers.

  [71] The term "related rights" is defined by each Party in
  accordance with its international obligations.

  [72] For the purposes of the function referred to in Article 10.63,
  service provider means a provider of transmission, routing, or
  connections for digital online communications without modification of
  their content between or among points specified by the user of
  material of the user’s choosing, and for the purpose of the functions
  referred to in Articles 10.64 and 10.65 service provider means a
