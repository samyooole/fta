    <chapter number="CHAPTER THREE" name="Textiles And Apparel" chapter_identifier="1791">
      <article number="ARTICLE 3.1" name="Bilateral Emergency Actions" article_identifier="15020">1. If, as a result of the reduction or elimination of a duty under this Agreement, a textile or apparel good benefiting from preferential tariff treatment under this Agreement is being imported into the territory of a Party in such increased quantities, in absolute terms or relative to the domestic market for that good, and under such conditions as to cause serious damage, or actual threat thereof, to a domestic industry producing a like or directly competitive good, the importing Party may, to the extent and for such time as may be necessary to prevent or remedy such damage and to facilitate adjustment, take emergency action, consisting of an increase in the rate of duty on the good to a level not to exceed the lesser of: 


(a) 	the most-favored-nation (MFN) applied rate of duty in effect at the time the action is taken; and 


(b) 	the MFN applied rate of duty in effect on the date of entry into force of this Agreement.  
2. 	In determining serious damage, or actual threat thereof, the importing Party:  


(a) 	shall examine the effect of increased imports of the good from the exporting Party on the particular industry, as reflected in changes in such relevant economic variables as output, productivity, utilization of capacity, inventories, market share, exports, wages, employment, domestic prices, profits, and investment, none of which is necessarily decisive; and 


(b) 	shall not consider changes in technology or consumer preference as factors supporting a determination of serious damage or actual threat thereof. 

3. The importing Party may take an emergency action under this Article only following an investigation by its competent authorities. 


4. The importing Party shall deliver to the exporting Party, without delay, written notice of its intent to take emergency action, and, on the request of the exporting Party, shall enter into consultations with that Party regarding the matter. 


5. The following conditions and limitations apply to any emergency action taken under this Article: 


(a) no emergency action may be maintained for a period exceeding three years; 


(b) 	no emergency action against a good may be taken or maintained beyond the period ending ten years after duties on that good have been eliminated pursuant to this Agreement;  


(c) 	no emergency action may be taken by an importing Party against the same good of the exporting Party more than once; and 


(d) 	on termination of the emergency action, the importing Party shall accord to the good that was subject to the emergency action the tariff treatment that would have been in effect but for the action. 

6. The Party taking an emergency action under this Article shall provide to the exporting Party mutually agreed trade liberalizing compensation in the form of concessions having substantially equivalent trade effects or equivalent to the value of the additional duties expected to result from the emergency action.  Such concessions shall be limited to textile and apparel goods, unless the Parties otherwise agree.  If the Parties are unable to agree on compensation, the Party against whose good the emergency action is taken may take tariff action having trade effects substantially equivalent to the trade effects of the emergency action taken under this Article.  Such tariff action may be taken against any goods of the Party taking the emergency action.  The Party taking the tariff action shall apply the tariff action only for the minimum period necessary to achieve the substantially equivalent trade effects. The importing Party’s obligation to provide trade compensation and the exporting Party’s right to take tariff action terminate when the emergency action terminates. 


7. Nothing in this Agreement shall be construed to limit a Party’s right to restrain imports of textile and apparel goods in a manner consistent with the Safeguards Agreement.  However, a Party may not take or maintain an emergency action under this Article against a textile or apparel good that is subject, or becomes subject, to a safeguard measure that a Party takes pursuant to the Safeguards Agreement.</article>
      <article number="ARTICLE 3.2" name="Rules Of Origin And Related Matters" article_identifier="15021">Application of Chapter Four 


1. Except as provided in this Chapter, including its Annex, Chapter Four (Rules of Origin) applies to textile and apparel goods. 


2. The rules of origin set forth in this Agreement shall not apply in determining the country of origin of a textile or apparel good for non-preferential purposes. 
Consultations 


3. On the request of either Party, the Parties shall consult to consider whether the rules of origin applicable to particular textile and apparel goods should be revised to address issues of availability of supply of fibers, yarns, or fabrics in the territories of the Parties. 


4. In the consultations referred to in paragraph 3, each Party shall consider all data presented by the other Party that demonstrate substantial production in its territory of a particular fiber, yarn, or fabric. The Parties shall consider that there is substantial production if a Party demonstrates that its domestic producers are capable of supplying commercial quantities of the fiber, yarn, or fabric in a timely manner. 


5. The Parties shall endeavor to conclude consultations within 60 days of a request. If the Parties agree in the consultations to revise a rule of origin, the agreed revision shall supersede any prior rule of origin for such good when approved by the Parties in accordance with Article 22.2 (Amendments). 
De Minimis 

6. A textile or apparel good that is not an originating good because certain fibers or yarns used in the production of the component of the good that determines the tariff classification of the good do not undergo an applicable change in tariff classification set out in Annex 3-A shall nonetheless be considered to be an originating good if the total weight of all such fibers or yarns in that component is not more than seven percent of the total weight of that component.  Notwithstanding the preceding sentence, a good containing elastomeric yarns in the component of the good that determines the tariff classification of the good shall be considered to be an originating good only if such yarns are wholly formed in the territory of a Party. 

Treatment of Sets 

7. Notwithstanding the specific rules of origin set out in Annex 3-A, textile and apparel goods classifiable under General Rule of Interpretation 3 of the Harmonized System as goods put up in sets for retail sale shall not be regarded as originating goods unless each of the goods in the set is an originating good or the total value of the non-originating goods in the set does not exceed 10 percent of the customs value of the set. 

Preferential Tariff Treatment for Certain Non-Originating Apparel Goods 


8. Subject to paragraph 9, each Party shall accord preferential tariff treatment to cotton or man-made fiber apparel goods provided for in Chapters 61 or 62 of the Harmonized System that are cut or knit to shape, or both, and sewn or otherwise assembled in the territory of a Party from fabric or yarn produced or obtained outside the territory of a Party, if they meet the applicable conditions for preferential tariff treatment under this Agreement other than the condition that they be originating goods. 


9. The treatment described in paragraph 8 shall be limited to goods imported into the territory of a Party up to an annual total quantity of 50,000,000 square meters equivalent in each of the first ten twelve-month periods after entry into force of this Agreement.  To determine the quantity in square meters equivalent that is charged against the annual quantity, the importing Party shall apply the conversion factors listed in the Correlation: 
U.S. Textile and Apparel Category System with the Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States of America (“The Textile Correlation”), 2004, U.S. Department of Commerce, Office of Textiles and Apparel, or successor publication. 


10. At the written request of an exporting Party, an importing Party shall require an importer claiming preferential tariff treatment under paragraph 8 to submit to the importing Party a certificate of eligibility.  An importing Party shall not accept such a claim unless the certificate of eligibility is properly completed and signed by an authorized official of the exporting Party and is presented at the time the preferential tariff treatment is claimed. 


11. Where an importing Party has reason to question the accuracy of a claim under paragraph 8, or where an importing Party seeks such information in the course of a verification under Article 3.3, it may require an importer claiming preferential tariff treatment for an apparel good under paragraph 8 to prepare, sign, and submit to its competent authority a declaration supporting such a claim for preferential tariff treatment and to provide all pertinent information concerning the production of the good, including: 


(a) 	a description of the good, quantity, invoice numbers, and bills of lading; 


(b) 	a description of the operations performed in the production of the good in the territory of one or both of the Parties; and 


(c) 	a statement as to any yarn or fabric of a non-Party and the origin of such materials used in the production of the good. 
The importing Party may require the importer to retain all documents relied upon to prepare the declaration for a period of five years. 

12. Paragraphs 8 through 11 shall cease to apply beginning on the first day of the 11th twelve-month period following the date of entry into force of this Agreement.</article>
      <article number="ARTICLE 3.3" name="Customs Cooperation For Textile And Apparel Goods" article_identifier="15022">1. 	The Parties shall cooperate for purposes of: 


(a) 	enforcing or assisting in the enforcement of their measures affecting trade in textile or apparel goods; 


(b) 	ensuring the accuracy of claims of origin; 


(c) 	enforcing or assisting in the enforcement of measures implementing international agreements affecting trade in textile or apparel goods; and 


(d) 	preventing circumvention of international agreements affecting trade in textile or apparel goods. 
2. Oman shall establish and maintain a program to ensure that textile and apparel goods that are imported into or exported from Oman, or that are processed or manipulated in Oman or in a free trade zone or export processing zone in Oman en route to the United States, are marked with the correct country of origin and that the documents accompanying the goods accurately describe the goods.  In this program, Oman shall provide for: 


(a) 	immediate referral by Omani officials of suspected violations of either Party’s measures relating to circumvention to the appropriate enforcement authorities; 


(b) 	with respect to enforcement action by Omani officials involving textile or apparel goods destined for the United States, not later than 30 days after the resolution of the matter, issuance by Omani officials to the United States of a written report describing: 


(i) 	each violation of law relating to circumvention, including a failure to maintain or produce records; 


(ii) 	any other act of circumvention; 
(iii) 	the resolution of the matter, including any enforcement action taken and any penalty imposed; and 

(iv) 	the identity of the enterprise found to have engaged in such circumvention. 


3. Oman shall establish and maintain a program to verify that textile and apparel goods that an enterprise claims as originating goods or marks as products of Oman and that are exported to the United States are produced in Oman.  In this program, Oman shall include on-site government inspections of such enterprises.  These visits should occur without providing prior notification to the enterprise to verify compliance with measures of either Party affecting trade in textile or apparel goods and to verify that production of and capability to produce such goods are consistent with claims regarding the origin of such goods. 


4. On the request of the importing Party, the exporting Party shall conduct a verification for purposes of enabling the importing Party to determine that a claim of origin for a textile or apparel good is accurate. The exporting Party shall conduct such a verification, regardless of whether an importer claims preferential tariff treatment for the good. The exporting Party also may conduct such a verification on its own initiative. 


5. Where the importing Party has a reasonable suspicion that an enterprise of the exporting Party is engaging in unlawful activity relating to trade in textile or apparel goods, the exporting Party shall conduct, on the request of the importing Party, a 
verification for purposes of enabling the importing Party to determine that the enterprise is complying with applicable customs measures affecting trade in textile or apparel goods, including measures that the exporting Party adopts and maintains pursuant to this Agreement and measures of either Party implementing other international agreements affecting trade in textile or apparel goods, or to determine that a claim of origin regarding textile or apparel goods exported or produced by that enterprise is accurate. For purposes of this paragraph, a reasonable suspicion of unlawful activity means a suspicion based on relevant factual information of the type set forth in Article 5.5 (Cooperation) or factors that indicate: 


(a) 	circumvention by an enterprise of applicable customs measures affecting trade in textile or apparel goods, including measures adopted to implement this Agreement; or 


(b) 	the existence of conduct that would facilitate the violation of measures relating to other international agreements affecting trade in textile or apparel goods or the nullification or impairment of rights or benefits accruing to a Party under such agreements. 

6. The exporting Party, through its competent authorities, shall permit the importing Party, through its competent authorities, to assist in a verification conducted pursuant to paragraph 4 or 5, including by conducting, along with the competent authorities of the exporting Party, visits in the territory of the exporting Party to the premises of an exporter, producer, or any other enterprise involved in the movement of a textile or apparel good from the territory of the exporting Party to the territory of the importing Party. If an exporter, producer, or other enterprise refuses to consent to a visit by the competent authorities of the importing Party, the importing Party may consider that the verification cannot be completed and the determination described in paragraph 4 or 5 cannot be made and  may take appropriate action as described in paragraph 11. 


7. Oman shall require each enterprise that exports, produces, or is otherwise involved in the movement of textile or apparel goods within the territory of Oman to maintain in Oman records relating to textile and apparel good production or exportation for a period of five years from the date on which such records are created.  Oman also shall require each enterprise that produces textile or apparel goods in the territory of Oman to maintain in Oman records relating to its production capabilities in general, the number of persons it employs, and any other records and information sufficient to allow officials of each Party to verify the enterprise’s production and exportation of textile or apparel goods. 


8. Each Party shall provide to the other Party, consistent with its law, production, trade, and transit documents and other information necessary to conduct a verification under paragraph 4 or 5. Each Party shall consider any documents or information exchanged between the Parties in the course of such a verification to be confidential within the meaning of Article 5.6 (Confidentiality).  Notwithstanding the previous sentence and Article 5.6 (Confidentiality), a governmental entity of a Party may share information gathered under this Article with other government entities of that Party for a purpose set forth in paragraph 1. Sharing information as described in this paragraph for a purpose set forth in paragraph 1 is deemed not to prejudice the competitive position of persons providing such information for purposes of Article 5.6.3 (Confidentiality). 


9. While a verification is being conducted, the importing Party may, consistent with its law, take appropriate action, which may include suspending the application of preferential tariff treatment to: 


(a) 	the textile or apparel good for which a claim of origin has been made, in the case of a verification under paragraph 4; or 


(b) 	any textile and apparel goods exported or produced by the enterprise 
subject to a verification under paragraph 5, where the reasonable suspicion of unlawful activity relates to those goods. 


10. The Party conducting a verification under paragraph 4 or 5 shall provide the other Party with a written report on the results of the verification, which shall include all documents and facts supporting any conclusion that the Party reaches. 


11. 	(a) If the importing Party is unable to make the determination described in paragraph 4 within 12 months after its request for a verification, or makes a negative determination, it may, consistent with its laws, regulations, and procedures, take appropriate action, including denying preferential tariff treatment to the textile or apparel good subject to the verification, and to similar goods exported or produced by the enterprise that exported or produced the good. 

(b) 	If the importing Party is unable to make one of the determinations described in paragraph 5 within 12 months after its request for a verification, or makes a negative determination, it may, consistent with its laws, regulations, and procedures, take appropriate action, including denying preferential tariff treatment to any textile or apparel goods exported or produced by the enterprise subject to the verification. 

12. Prior to commencing any action under paragraph 11, the importing Party shall notify the other Party. The importing Party may continue to take appropriate action under paragraph 11 until it receives information sufficient to enable it to make the determination described in paragraph 4 or 5, as the case may be.  A Party may make public the identity of an enterprise that it has determined to have made an inaccurate claim of origin for a textile or apparel good as described in paragraph 4 or to have engaged in unlawful activity relating to trade in textile and apparel goods as described in paragraph 5. 


13. On the request of either Party, the Parties shall enter into consultations to resolve any technical or interpretive difficulties that may arise under this Article or to discuss ways to improve the effectiveness of their cooperative efforts.  In addition, either Party may request technical or other assistance from the other Party in implementing this Article. The Party receiving such a request shall make every effort to respond favorably and promptly to it.  Each Party shall, at the request of either Party, establish and maintain working level contact points in order to facilitate the effective implementation of this Article.</article>

4. In prescribing the technical specifications for the good or service being procured, a procuring entity shall:

6. A procuring entity may not seek or accept, in a manner that would have the effect of precluding competition, advice that may be used in the preparation or adoption of any technical specification for a specific covered procurement from a person that may have a commercial interest in the procurement. 


7. For greater certainty, this Article is not intended to preclude a procuring entity from preparing, adopting, or applying technical specifications to promote the conservation of natural resources or to protect the environment.

(b) 	evaluate the financial, commercial, and technical abilities of a supplier on the basis of its global business activities, including both its activities in the territory of the other Party, as well as its activities, if any, in the territory of the Party conducting the procurement, and may not impose the condition that, in order for a supplier to participate in a covered procurement, the supplier has previously been awarded one or more contracts by a procuring entity of that Party or that the supplier has prior work experience in the territory of that Party;           


(c) 	base its determination of whether a supplier has satisfied the conditions for participation solely on the conditions that the procuring entity has specified in advance in notices or tender documentation; and

(c) 	significant deficiencies in performance of any substantive requirement or obligation under a prior contract.  
3. Where a procuring entity requires suppliers to satisfy conditions for participation, the entity shall publish a notice inviting suppliers to apply for participation. The entity shall publish the notice sufficiently in advance to provide interested suppliers adequate time to prepare and submit responsive applications and for the entity to evaluate and make its determination based on such applications. 

Multi-Use Lists 

4. A procuring entity may establish a multi-use list provided that the entity annually publishes in a paper or electronic medium, or otherwise makes available continuously in electronic form, a notice inviting interested suppliers to apply for inclusion on the list.  The notice shall include:

Information on Procuring Entity Decisions 


6. Where a supplier applies for participation in a covered procurement, or for inclusion on a multi-use list, a procuring entity shall promptly advise such supplier of its decision with respect to its application. 


7. Where a procuring entity rejects an application for participation in a covered procurement or for inclusion on a multi-use list or ceases to recognize a supplier as having satisfied the conditions for participation, the entity shall promptly inform the supplier and, on request of such supplier, promptly provide the supplier a written explanation of the reasons for its decision.</article>
      <article number="ARTICLE 9.8" name="Tendering Procedures" article_identifier="15075">1. A procuring entity shall conduct procurement covered by this Agreement in a manner that is consistent with this Chapter, and, except where specifically provided otherwise in this Chapter, in a transparent and impartial manner and shall permit any interested supplier to submit a tender. 


2. Provided that the tendering procedure is not used to avoid competition, to protect domestic suppliers, or in a manner that discriminates against suppliers of the other Party, a procuring entity may contact a supplier or suppliers of its choice and may choose not to apply Articles 9.4 through 9.7, paragraph 1 and paragraphs 3 through 7 of Article 9.9 in the following circumstances: 
(a) 	where, in response to a prior notice of intended procurement or invitation to tender, 


(i) 	no tenders were submitted; 


(ii) 	no tenders were submitted that conform to the essential requirements in the tender documentation; or 
(iii) 	no suppliers satisfied the conditions for participation; 

and the entity does not substantially modify the essential requirements of the procurement or the conditions for participation; 


(b) 	where the goods or services can be supplied only by a particular supplier and no reasonable alternative or substitute goods or services exist because: 


(i) 	the requirement is for a work of art; 


(ii) 	the procuring entity is obligated to protect patents, copyrights, or other exclusive rights, or proprietary information; or 
(iii) 	there is an absence of competition for technical reasons;  

(c) 	for additional deliveries of goods or services by the original supplier that are intended either as replacement parts, extensions, or continuing services for existing equipment, software, services, or installations, where a change of supplier would compel the procuring entity to procure goods or services that do not meet requirements of interchangeability with existing equipment, software, services, or installations;  


(d) 	for goods purchased on a commodity market;  


(e) 	where a procuring entity procures a prototype or a first good or service that is developed at its request in the course of, and for, a particular contract for research, experiment, study, or original development.  When such a contract has been fulfilled, subsequent procurements of goods or services shall be subject to this Chapter; or 


(f) 	in so far as is strictly necessary where, for reasons of extreme urgency brought about by events unforeseeable by the procuring entity, the goods or services could not be obtained in time under procedures consistent with Articles 9.4 through 9.7, paragraph 1 and paragraphs 3 through 7 of Article 9.9, and the use of such procedures would result in serious injury to the procuring entity or the relevant Party. 
3. For each contract awarded under paragraph 2, a procuring entity shall prepare a written report that includes the name of the procuring entity, the value and kind of goods or services procured, and a statement indicating the circumstances and conditions described in paragraph 2 that justify the use of a limited tendering procedure.</article>

1. A procuring entity or relevant authority shall receive and open all tenders under procedures that guarantee the fairness and impartiality of the procurement process.  


2. A procuring entity or relevant authority shall treat tenders in confidence.  In particular, it shall not provide information to particular suppliers that might prejudice fair competition between suppliers. 


3. In the event of a delay in the opening of a tender, a procuring entity or relevant authority shall not penalize any supplier whose tender is submitted by the time specified for receiving tenders, if the delay is due solely to mishandling on the part of the procuring entity. 


4. Where a procuring entity or relevant authority provides suppliers with opportunities to correct unintentional errors of form between the opening of tenders and the awarding of the contract, the procuring entity or relevant authority shall provide the same opportunities to all participating suppliers.

(a) 	be submitted in writing by a supplier that satisfies the conditions, if any, for participation; and 


(b) 	at the time of opening, conform to the essential requirements and evaluation criteria specified in the notices and tender documentation.

7. A procuring entity or relevant authority may not cancel a procurement, nor terminate or modify a contract it has awarded, in a manner that circumvents the obligations of this Chapter. 
Information Provided to Suppliers

4. Each Party shall authorize the authority that it establishes or designates under paragraph 2 to take prompt interim measures, pending the resolution of a challenge, to preserve the opportunity to correct potential breaches of this Chapter, including the suspension of the award of a contract or the performance of a contract already awarded.

A Party that makes such a rectification or minor amendment need not provide compensatory adjustments to the other Party. 


3. A Party need not provide compensatory adjustments where the Parties agree that the proposed modification covers a procuring entity over which a Party has effectively eliminated its control or influence.  Where the Parties do not agree that government control or influence has been effectively eliminated, the objecting Party may request further information or consultations with a view to clarifying the nature of any government control or influence and reaching agreement on the procuring entity’s continued coverage under this Chapter.

11. Each Party shall provide that initial registration and each renewal of registration of a trademark shall be for a term of no less than ten years.

In order to ensure that no hierarchy is established between rights of authors, on the one hand, and rights of performers and producers of phonograms, on the other hand, each Party shall provide that in cases where authorization is needed from both the author of a work embodied in a phonogram and a performer or producer owning rights in the phonogram, the need for the authorization of the author does not cease to exist because the authorization of the performer or producer is also required.  Likewise, each Party shall establish that in cases where authorization is needed from both the author of a work embodied in a phonogram and a performer or producer owning rights in the phonogram, the need for the authorization of the performer or producer does not cease to exist because the authorization of the author is also required. 


4. Each Party shall provide that, where the term of protection of a work (including a photographic work), performance, or phonogram is to be calculated: 


(a) 	on the basis of the life of a natural person, the term shall be not less than the life of the author and 70 years after the author’s death; and 


(b) 	on a basis other than the life of a natural person, the term shall be 


(i) 	not less than 95 years from the end of the calendar year of the first authorized publication of the work, performance, or phonogram, or

(b) 	its judicial authorities shall have the authority to order that materials and implements that have been used in the manufacture or creation of the pirated or counterfeit goods be, without compensation of any sort, promptly destroyed or, in exceptional circumstances, without compensation of any sort, disposed of outside the channels of commerce in such a manner as to minimize the risks of further infringements; and 


(c) 	in regard to counterfeit trademarked goods, the simple removal of the trademark unlawfully affixed shall not be sufficient to permit the release of goods into the channels of commerce.   

11. Each Party shall provide that, in civil judicial proceedings concerning the enforcement of intellectual property rights, its judicial authorities shall have the authority to order the infringer to provide any information that the infringer possesses regarding any person or persons involved in any aspect of the infringement and regarding the means of production or distribution channel of such goods or services, including the identification of third persons involved in the production and distribution of the infringing goods or services or in their channels of distribution, and to provide this information to the right holder.   


12. 	Each Party shall provide that its judicial authorities shall have the authority to: 


(a) 	fine or imprison, in appropriate cases, a party to a litigation who fails to abide by valid orders issued by such authorities; and 


(b) 	impose sanctions on parties to a litigation, their counsel, experts, or other persons subject to the court’s jurisdiction, for violation of judicial orders regarding the protection of confidential information produced or exchanged in a proceeding. 

13. To the extent that any civil remedy can be ordered as a result of administrative procedures on the merits of a case, each Party shall provide that such procedures conform to principles equivalent in substance to those set out in this Chapter. 


14. In civil judicial proceedings concerning the acts described in paragraphs 7 and 8 of Article 15.4, each Party shall provide that its judicial authorities shall have the authority to order or award at least:  


(a) 	provisional measures, including seizure of devices and products suspected of being involved in the prohibited activity;

15. In civil judicial proceedings concerning the enforcement of intellectual property rights, each Party shall provide that its judicial authorities shall have the authority to order a party to desist from an infringement, in order, inter alia, to prevent, immediately after they clear customs, the entry into the channels of commerce in the jurisdiction of those authorities of imported goods that involve the infringement of an intellectual property right, or to prevent their exportation. 


16. In the event that a Party’s judicial or other authorities appoint technical or other experts in civil proceedings concerning the enforcement of intellectual property rights and require that the parties to the litigation bear the costs of such experts, the Party should seek to ensure that such costs are closely related, inter alia, to the quantity and nature of work to be performed and do not unreasonably deter recourse to such proceedings. 
Provisional Measures 


17. Parties shall act on requests for relief inaudita altera parte expeditiously and shall, except in exceptional cases, generally execute such requests within ten days. 


18. Each Party shall provide that its judicial authorities have the authority to require the plaintiff to provide any reasonably available evidence in order to satisfy themselves with a sufficient degree of certainty that the plaintiff’s right is being infringed or that such infringement is imminent, and to order the plaintiff to provide a reasonable security or equivalent assurance set at a level sufficient to protect the defendant and to prevent abuse, and so as not to unreasonably deter recourse to such procedures. 


19. In proceedings concerning the grant of provisional measures in relation to enforcement of a patent, each Party shall provide for a rebuttable presumption that the patent is valid. 
Special Requirements Related to Border Measures 

20. Each Party shall provide that any right holder initiating procedures for its competent authorities to suspend release of suspected counterfeit or confusingly similar trademark goods, or pirated copyright goods,
15
 into free circulation is required to provide adequate evidence to satisfy the competent authorities that, under the laws of the country of importation, there is prima facie an infringement of the right holder's intellectual property right and to supply sufficient information that may reasonably be expected to be 

15  For purposes of paragraphs 20 through 25: 


(a) 	counterfeit trademark goods means any goods, including packaging, bearing without authorization a trademark that is identical to the trademark validly registered in respect of such goods, or that cannot be distinguished in its essential aspects from such a trademark, and that thereby infringes the rights of the owner of the trademark in question under the law of the country of importation; and 


(b)  	pirated copyright goods means any goods that are copies made without the consent of the right holder or person duly authorized by the right holder in the country of production and that are made directly or indirectly from an article where the making of that copy would have constituted an infringement of a copyright or a related right under the law of the country of importation. 
within the right holder’s knowledge to make the suspected goods reasonably recognizable by its competent authorities.  The requirement to provide sufficient information shall not unreasonably deter recourse to these procedures.  Each Party shall provide that the application to suspend the release of goods shall remain in force for a period of not less than one year from the date of application, or the period that the good is protected by copyright or the relevant trademark registration, whichever is shorter. 


21. Each Party shall provide that its competent authorities shall have the authority to require a right holder initiating procedures to suspend the release of suspected counterfeit or confusingly similar trademark goods, or pirated copyright goods, to provide a reasonable security or equivalent assurance sufficient to protect the defendant and the competent authorities and to prevent abuse.  Each Party shall provide that such security or equivalent assurance shall not unreasonably deter recourse to these procedures.  Each Party may provide that such security may be in the form of a bond conditioned to hold the importer or owner of the imported merchandise harmless from any loss or damage resulting from any suspension of the release of goods in the event the competent authorities determine that the article is not an infringing good. 


22. Where its competent authorities have made a determination that goods are counterfeit or pirated, a Party shall grant its competent authorities the authority to inform the right holder of the names and addresses of the consignor, the importer, and the consignee, and of the quantity of the goods in question. 


23. Each Party shall provide that its competent authorities may initiate border measures ex officio, with respect to imported, exported, or in-transit merchandise,
16
 or merchandise in free trade zones, suspected of being counterfeit or confusingly similar trademark goods, or pirated copyright goods, without the need for a formal complaint from a private party or right holder.    


24. Each Party shall provide that goods that have been determined to be pirated or counterfeit by its competent authorities shall be destroyed, except in exceptional circumstances.  In regard to counterfeit trademark goods, the simple removal of the trademark unlawfully affixed shall not be sufficient to permit the release of the goods into the channels of commerce.  In no event shall the competent authorities be authorized, except in exceptional circumstances, to permit the exportation of counterfeit or pirated goods or to permit such goods to be subject to other customs procedures. 


25. Where an application fee or merchandise storage fee is assessed in connection with border measures to enforce an intellectual property right, each Party shall provide that such fee shall not be set at an amount that unreasonably deters recourse to these measures. 
Criminal Procedures and Remedies 

26. Each Party shall provide for criminal procedures and penalties to be applied at least in cases of willful trademark counterfeiting or copyright or related rights piracy on a commercial scale. Willful copyright or related rights piracy on a commercial scale includes: 

(a) 	significant willful copyright or related rights infringements that have no direct or indirect motivation of financial gain; and 

16  For purposes of paragraph 23, in-transit merchandise means goods under “Customs transit” and goods “transshipped”, as defined in the International Convention on the Simplification and Harmonization of Customs Procedures (Kyoto Convention). 

(b) 	willful infringements for purposes of commercial advantage or private financial gain.
17 


Each Party shall treat willful importation or exportation of counterfeit or pirated goods as unlawful activities subject to criminal penalties at least to the same extent as the trafficking or distribution of such goods in domestic commerce.
18 


27. 	Specifically, each Party shall provide: 


(a) 	remedies that include sentences of imprisonment as well as monetary fines sufficient to provide a deterrent to future infringements, consistent with a policy of removing the infringer’s monetary incentive.  Each Party shall further establish policies or guidelines that encourage judicial authorities to impose those remedies at levels sufficient to provide a deterrent to future infringements;  


(b) 	that its judicial authorities shall have the authority to order the seizure of suspected counterfeit or pirated goods, any related materials and implements used in the commission of the offense, any assets traceable to the infringing activity, and any documentary evidence relevant to the offense. Each Party shall provide that such orders need not individually identify the items that are subject to seizure, so long as they fall within general categories specified in the order;    


(c) 	that its judicial authorities shall have the authority, among other measures, to order the forfeiture of any assets traceable to the infringing activity and shall, except in exceptional cases, order the forfeiture and destruction of all counterfeit or pirated goods, and, at least with respect to willful copyright or related rights piracy, order the forfeiture and destruction of materials and implements that have been used in the creation of infringing goods. Each Party shall further provide that such forfeiture and destruction shall occur without compensation of any kind to the defendant; 


(d) 	that, in criminal cases, its judicial or other competent authorities shall keep an inventory of goods and other material proposed to be destroyed, and shall have the authority temporarily to exempt such materials from the destruction order to facilitate the preservation of evidence upon notice by the right holder that it wishes to bring a civil or administrative case for damages; and 


(e) 	that its authorities may initiate legal action ex officio with respect to the offenses described in this Chapter, without the need for a formal complaint by a private party or right holder. 
28. Each Party shall also provide for criminal procedures and penalties to be applied in the following cases, even absent willful trademark counterfeiting or copyright piracy: 

(a) 	knowing trafficking in counterfeit labels affixed or designed to be affixed to: a phonogram, a copy of a computer program, documentation or packaging for a computer program, or a copy of a motion picture or other audiovisual work; and 

17  For greater certainty, “financial gain” for purposes of this paragraph includes the receipt or expectation of anything of value. 

18  A Party may comply with this obligation in relation to exportation through its measures concerning distribution or trafficking. 

(b) 	knowing trafficking in counterfeit documentation or packaging for a computer program.  

Liability for Service Providers and Limitations 

29. For the purpose of providing enforcement procedures that permit effective action against any act of copyright
19
 infringement covered by this Chapter, including expeditious remedies to prevent infringements and criminal and civil remedies that constitute a deterrent to further infringements, each Party shall provide, consistent with the framework set out in this Article:  


(a) 	legal incentives for service providers to cooperate with copyright owners in deterring the unauthorized storage and transmission of copyrighted materials; and 


(b) 	limitations in its law regarding the scope of remedies available against service providers for copyright infringements that they do not control, initiate, or direct, and that take place through systems or networks controlled or operated by them or on their behalf, as set forth in this subparagraph (b).
20 



(i) 	These limitations shall preclude monetary relief and provide reasonable restrictions on court-ordered relief to compel or restrain certain actions for the following functions, and shall be confined to those functions:
21 



(A) 	transmitting, routing, or providing connections for material without modification of its content, or the intermediate and transient storage of such material in the course thereof; 


(B) 	caching carried out through an automatic process; 


(C) 	storage at the direction of a user of material residing on a system or network controlled or operated by or for the service provider; and 


(D) 	referring or linking users to an online location by using information location tools, including hyperlinks and directories. 

(ii) 	These limitations shall apply only where the service provider does not initiate the chain of transmission of the material, and does not select the material or its recipients (except to the extent that a function described in clause (i)(D) in itself entails some form of selection). 
(iii) 	Qualification by a service provider for the limitations as to each function in clauses (i)(A) through (D) shall be considered separately from qualification for the limitations as to each other 

19  For purposes of this paragraph, “copyright” includes related rights. 

20  This subparagraph is without prejudice to the availability of defenses to copyright infringement that are of general applicability. 

21  Either Party may request consultations with the other Party to consider how to address under this paragraph functions of a similar nature that a Party identifies after the date of entry into force of this Agreement. 

function, in accordance with the conditions for qualification set forth in clauses (iv) through (vii).  


(iv) 	With respect to functions referred to in clause (i)(B), the limitations shall be conditioned on the service provider:  


(A) 	permitting access to cached material in significant part only to users of its system or network who have met conditions on user access to that material; 


(B) 	complying with rules concerning the refreshing, reloading, or other updating of the cached material when specified by the person making the material available online in accordance with a generally accepted industry standard data communications protocol for the system or network through which that person makes the material available; 


(C) 	not interfering with technology consistent with industry standards accepted in the Party’s territory used at the originating site to obtain information about the use of the material, and not modifying its content in transmission to subsequent users; and 


(D) 	expeditiously removing or disabling access, on receipt of an effective notification of claimed infringement, to cached material that has been removed or access to which has been disabled at the originating site. 

(v) 	With respect to functions referred to in clauses (i)(C) and (D), the limitations shall be conditioned on the service provider:  


(A) 	not receiving a financial benefit directly attributable to the infringing activity, in circumstances where it has the right and ability to control such activity; 


(B) 	expeditiously removing or disabling access to the material residing on its system or network on obtaining actual knowledge of the infringement or becoming aware of facts or circumstances from which the infringement was apparent, such as through effective notifications of claimed infringement in accordance with clause (ix); and 


(C) 	publicly designating a representative to receive such notifications. 

(vi) 	Eligibility for the limitations in this subparagraph shall be conditioned on the service provider: 


(A) 	adopting and reasonably implementing a policy that provides for termination in appropriate circumstances of the accounts of repeat infringers; and   


(B) 	accommodating and not interfering with standard technical measures accepted in the Party’s territory that protect and identify copyrighted material, that are developed through an open, voluntary process by a broad consensus of copyright owners and service providers, that are available on reasonable and nondiscriminatory terms, and that do not 
impose substantial costs on service providers or substantial burdens on their systems or networks.  

(vii) 	Eligibility for the limitations in this subparagraph may not be conditioned on the service provider monitoring its service, or affirmatively seeking facts indicating infringing activity, except to the extent consistent with such technical measures. 

(viii) 	If the service provider qualifies for the limitations with respect to the function referred to in clause (i)(A), court-ordered relief to compel or restrain certain actions shall be limited to terminating specified accounts, or to taking reasonable steps to block access to a specific, non-domestic online location.  If the service provider qualifies for the limitations with respect to any other function in clause (i), court-ordered relief to compel or restrain certain actions shall be limited to removing or disabling access to the infringing material, terminating specified accounts, and other remedies that a court may find necessary, provided that such other remedies are the least burdensome to the service provider among comparably effective forms of relief.  Each Party shall provide that any such relief shall be issued with due regard for the relative burden to the service provider and harm to the copyright owner, the technical feasibility and effectiveness of the remedy, and whether less burdensome, comparably effective enforcement methods are available. Except for orders ensuring the preservation of evidence, or other orders having no material adverse effect on the operation of the service provider’s communications network, each Party shall provide that such relief shall be available only where the service provider has received notice of the court order proceedings referred to in this subparagraph and an opportunity to appear before the judicial authority. 


(ix) 	For purposes of the notice and take down process for the functions referred to in clauses (i)(C) and (D), each Party shall establish appropriate procedures in its law or in regulations for effective notifications of claimed infringement, and effective counter-notifications by those whose material is removed or disabled through mistake or misidentification. Each Party shall also provide for monetary remedies against any person who makes a knowing material misrepresentation in a notification or counter-notification that causes injury to any interested party as a result of a service provider relying on the misrepresentation.  


(x) 	If the service provider removes or disables access to material in good faith based on claimed or apparent infringement, each Party shall provide that the service provider shall be exempted from liability for any resulting claims, provided that, in the case of material residing on its system or network, it takes reasonable steps promptly to notify the person making the material available on its system or network that it has done so and, if such person makes an effective counter-notification and is subject to jurisdiction in an infringement suit, to restore the material online unless the person giving the original effective notification seeks judicial relief within a reasonable time.   


(xi) 	Each Party shall establish an administrative or judicial procedure enabling copyright owners who have given effective notification of claimed infringement to obtain expeditiously from a service 
provider information in its possession identifying the alleged infringer. 

(xii) 	For purposes of the function referred to in clause (i)(A), service provider means a provider of transmission, routing, or connections for digital online communications without modification of their content between or among points specified by the user of material of the user’s choosing, and for purposes of the functions referred to in clauses (i)(B) through (D) service provider means a provider or operator of facilities for online services or network access.</article>

The monetary assessment shall be payable in U.S. currency, or in an equivalent amount of Omani currency, in equal, quarterly installments beginning 60 days after the complaining Party provides such notice.  Each of the first four quarterly instalments shall be equal to one quarter of the monetary assessment determined by the panel under Article 20.12.2. The fifth quarterly instalment and subsequent quarterly instalments shall be adjusted for inflation as specified in Annex 20-A. 


4. Assessments shall be paid into a fund established by the Joint Committee and shall be expended at the direction of the Joint Committee for appropriate labor or environmental initiatives, including efforts to improve or enhance labor or environmental law enforcement, as the case may be, in the territory of the Party complained against, consistent with its law. In deciding how to expend monies paid into the fund, the Joint Committee shall consider the views of interested persons in each Party’s territory. 


5. If the Party complained against fails to pay a monetary assessment, and if the Party has created and funded an escrow account to ensure payment of any assessments against it, the other Party shall, before having recourse to any other measure, seek to obtain the funds from the account. 


6. If the complaining Party cannot obtain the funds from the other Party’s escrow account within 30 days of the date on which payment is due, or if the other Party has not created an escrow account, the complaining Party may take other appropriate steps to collect the assessment or otherwise secure compliance.  These steps may include suspending tariff benefits under the Agreement as necessary to collect the assessment, while bearing in mind the Agreement’s objective of eliminating barriers to bilateral trade and while seeking to avoid unduly affecting parties or interests not party to the dispute.</article>

Without prejudice to the procedures set out in Article 20.11.3, if the Party complained against considers that it has eliminated the non-conformity or the nullification or impairment that the panel has found, it may refer the matter to the panel by providing written notice to the other Party. The panel shall issue its report on the matter within 90 days after the Party complained against provides notice. 


2. If the panel decides that the Party complained against has eliminated the nonconformity or the nullification or impairment, the complaining Party shall promptly reinstate any benefits it has suspended under Article 20.11 or 20.12 and the Party complained against shall no longer be required to pay any monetary assessment it has agreed to pay under Article 20.11.5 or that has been imposed on it under Article 20.12.</article>

If the competent authorities do not agree to consider the issue or, having agreed to consider it, fail to agree that the measure is not an expropriation within a period of 180 days of such referral, the investor may submit its claim to arbitration under Article 

10.15 (Investment – Submission of a Claim to Arbitration).
