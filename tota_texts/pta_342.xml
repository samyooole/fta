(b) 	allow all domestic suppliers and suppliers of the other Party that the entity has determined satisfy the conditions for participation to submit a tender, unless the entity has stated in the notice of intended procurement or, where publicly available, the tender documentation a limitation on the number of suppliers that will be permitted to tender and the criteria for such a limitation.  
Information on Procuring Entity’s Decisions

(d) 	for goods purchased on a commodity market;  


(e) 	where a procuring entity procures a prototype or a first good or service that is developed at its request in the course of, and for, a particular contract for research, experiment, study, or original development. For greater certainty, when such a

(ii) 	for breach of an investment agreement under Article 10.16.1(a)(i)(C) or Article 10.16.1(b)(i)(C), 
if the claimant (for claims brought under 10.16.1(a)) or the claimant or the enterprise (for claims brought under 10.16.1(b)) has previously submitted the same alleged breach to an administrative tribunal or court of the respondent, or to any other binding dispute settlement procedure. 

(b) 	For greater certainty, if a claimant elects to submit a claim of the type described in subparagraph (a) to an administrative tribunal or court of the respondent, or to any other binding dispute settlement procedure, that election shall be definitive, and the claimant may not thereafter submit the claim to arbitration under Section B.</article>
      <article number="ARTICLE 10.19" name="Selection Of Arbitrators" article_identifier="26004">1.

2. The Secretary-General shall serve as appointing authority for an arbitration under this Section. 


3. If a tribunal has not been constituted within 75 days from the date that a claim is submitted to arbitration under this Section, the Secretary-General, on the request of a disputing party, shall appoint, in his or her discretion, the arbitrator or arbitrators not yet appointed. 
9  In an action for interim injunctive relief described in paragraph 3 (including an action seeking to preserve evidence or property during the pendency of a dispute submitted to arbitration), a judicial or administrative tribunal of the Party that is the respondent in a dispute submitted to arbitration under Section B may apply the law of that Party, including its rules on the conflict of laws, and such rules of international law as may be applicable.

The disputing parties may agree on the legal place of any arbitration under the arbitral rules applicable under Article 10.16.3.  If the disputing parties fail to reach agreement, the tribunal shall determine the place in accordance with the applicable arbitral rules, provided that the place shall be in the territory of a State that is a party to the New York Convention. 


2. A non-disputing Party may make oral and written submissions to the tribunal regarding the interpretation of this Agreement. 


3. The tribunal shall have the authority to accept and consider amicus curiae submissions from a person or entity that is not a disputing party.  Each submission shall identify the author and any person or entity that has provided, or will provide, any financial or other assistance in preparing the submission. 


4. Without prejudice to a tribunal’s authority to address other objections as a preliminary question, such as an objection that a dispute is not within the tribunal’s competence, a tribunal shall address and decide as a preliminary question any objection by the respondent that, as a matter of law, a claim submitted is not a claim for which an award in favor of the claimant may be made under Article 10.26.
10 

10  For greater certainty, with respect to a claim submitted under Article 10.16.1(a)(i)(C) or 10.16.1(b)(i)(C), an objection that, as a matter of law, a claim submitted is not a claim for which an award in favor of the claimant may be made under Article 10.26 may include, where applicable, an objection provided for under the law of the respondent.  


(a) 	Such objection shall be submitted to the tribunal as soon as possible after the tribunal is constituted, and in no event later than the date the tribunal fixes for the respondent to submit its counter-memorial (or, in the case of an amendment to the notice of arbitration, the date the tribunal fixes for the respondent to submit its response to the amendment).   


(b) 	On receipt of an objection under this paragraph, the tribunal shall suspend any proceedings on the merits, establish a schedule for considering the objection consistent with any schedule it has established for considering any other preliminary question, and issue a decision or award on the objection, stating the grounds therefor. 


(c) 	In deciding an objection under this paragraph, the tribunal shall assume to be true claimant’s factual allegations in support of any claim in the notice of arbitration (or any amendment thereof) and, in disputes brought under the UNCITRAL Arbitration Rules, the statement of claim referred to in Article 18 of the UNCITRAL Arbitration Rules.  The tribunal may also consider any relevant facts not in dispute. 


(d) 	The respondent does not waive any objection as to competence or any argument on the merits merely because the respondent did or did not raise an objection under this paragraph or make use of the expedited procedure set out in paragraph 
5. 


5. In the event that the respondent so requests within 45 days after the tribunal is constituted, the tribunal shall decide on an expedited basis an objection under paragraph 4 and any objection that the dispute is not within the tribunal’s competence.  The tribunal shall suspend any proceedings on the merits and issue a decision or award on the objection(s), stating the grounds therefor, no later than 150 days after the date of the request.  However, if a disputing party requests a hearing, the tribunal may take an additional 30 days to issue the decision or award. Regardless of whether a hearing is requested, a tribunal may, on a showing of extraordinary cause, delay issuing its decision or award by an additional brief period, which may not exceed 30 days. 


6. When it decides a respondent’s objection under paragraph 4 or 5, the tribunal may, if warranted, award to the prevailing disputing party reasonable costs and attorney’s fees incurred in submitting or opposing the objection.  In determining whether such an award is warranted, the tribunal shall consider whether either the claimant’s claim or the respondent’s objection was frivolous, and shall provide the disputing parties a reasonable opportunity to comment. 


7. A respondent may not assert as a defense, counterclaim, right of set-off, or for any other reason that the claimant has received or will receive indemnification or other compensation for all or part of the alleged damages pursuant to an insurance or guarantee contract. 


8. A tribunal may order an interim measure of protection to preserve the rights of a disputing party, or to ensure that the tribunal’s jurisdiction is made fully effective, including an order to preserve evidence in the possession or control of a disputing party or to protect the tribunal’s jurisdiction. A tribunal may not order attachment or enjoin the application of a measure alleged to constitute a breach referred to in Article 10.16.  For purposes of this paragraph, an order includes a recommendation. 


9. 	(a) In any arbitration conducted under this Section, at the request of a disputing party, a tribunal shall, before issuing a decision or award on liability, transmit its proposed decision or award to the disputing parties and to the non-disputing Parties. Within 60 days after the tribunal transmits its proposed decision or award, the disputing parties may submit written comments to the tribunal concerning any aspect of its proposed decision or award.  The tribunal shall consider any such comments and issue its decision or award not later than 45 days after the expiration of the 60-day comment period. 

(b) 	Subparagraph (a) shall not apply in any arbitration conducted pursuant to this Section for which an appeal has been made available pursuant to paragraph 10 or Annex 10-D. 

10. If a separate, multilateral agreement enters into force between the Parties that establishes an appellate body for purposes of reviewing awards rendered by tribunals constituted pursuant to international trade or investment arrangements to hear investment disputes, the Parties shall strive to reach an agreement that would have such appellate body review awards rendered under Article 10.26 in arbitrations commenced after the multilateral agreement enters into force between the Parties.</article>
      <article number="ARTICLE 10.21" name="Transparency Of Arbitral Proceedings" article_identifier="26006">1. Subject to paragraphs 2 and 4, the respondent shall, after receiving the following documents, promptly transmit them to the non-disputing Parties and make them available to the public:

3. Nothing in this Section requires a respondent to disclose protected information or to furnish or allow access to information that it may withhold in accordance with Article 22.2 (Essential Security) or Article 22.4 (Disclosure of Information). 


4. Any protected information that is submitted to the tribunal shall be protected from disclosure in accordance with the following procedures:

      <article number="ARTICLE 16.9" name="Patents" article_identifier="26092">1. Each Party shall make patents available for any invention, whether a product or process, in all fields of technology, provided that the invention is new, involves an inventive step, and is capable of industrial application. For the purposes of this Article, a Party may treat the terms “inventive step” and “capable of industrial application” as being synonymous with the terms “non-obvious” and “useful,” respectively.  


2. Nothing in this Chapter shall be construed to prevent a Party from excluding inventions from patentability as set out in Articles 27.2 and 27.3 of the TRIPS Agreement.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, a Party that does not provide patent protection for plants by the date of entry into force of this Agreement shall undertake all reasonable efforts to make such patent protection available consistent with paragraph 1. Any Party that provides patent protection for plants or animals on or after the date of entry into force of this Agreement shall maintain such protection.   


3. Each Party may provide limited exceptions to the exclusive rights conferred by a patent, provided that such exceptions do not unreasonably conflict with a normal exploitation of the patent and do not unreasonably prejudice the legitimate interests of the patent owner, taking account of the legitimate interests of third parties. 


4. Without prejudice to Article 5.A(3) of the Paris Convention, each Party shall provide that a patent may be revoked or nullified only on grounds that would have justified a refusal to grant 

the patent according to its laws. However, a Party may also provide that fraud, misrepresentation, or inequitable conduct may be the basis for revoking, nullifying, or holding a patent unenforceable. 

5. Consistent with paragraph 3, if a Party permits a third person to use the subject matter of a subsisting patent to generate information necessary to support an application for marketing approval of a pharmaceutical product or agricultural chemical product, that Party shall provide that any product produced under such authority shall not be made, used, sold, offered for sale, or imported in the territory of that Party other than for purposes related to generating information to meet requirements for approval to market the product once the patent expires, and if the Party permits exportation, the product shall only be exported outside the territory of that Party for purposes of meeting marketing approval requirements of that Party. 
6. 

(a) 

Each Party shall make best efforts to process patent applications and marketing 




approval applications expeditiously with a view to avoiding unreasonable delays.  




The Parties shall cooperate and provide assistance to one another to achieve these 




objectives. 


(b) 

Each Party shall provide the means to and shall, at the request of the patent 




owner, compensate for unreasonable delays in the issuance of a patent, other than 




a patent for a pharmaceutical product, by restoring patent term or patent rights.  




Each Party may provide the means to and may, at the request of the patent owner, 




compensate for unreasonable delays in the issuance of a patent for a 




pharmaceutical product by restoring patent term or patent rights.  Any restoration 




under this subparagraph shall confer all of the exclusive rights of a patent subject 




to the same limitations and exceptions applicable to the original patent.  For 




purposes of this subparagraph, an unreasonable delay shall at least include a delay 




in the issuance of the patent of more than five years from the date of filing of the 




application in the territory of the Party, or three years after a request for 




examination of the application has been made, whichever is later, provided that 




periods attributable to actions of the patent applicant need not be included in the 




determination of such delays. 


(c) 

With respect to any pharmaceutical product that is covered by a patent, each Party 




may make available a restoration of the patent term or patent rights to compensate 




the patent owner for unreasonable curtailment of the effective patent term 




resulting from the marketing approval process related to the first commercial 




marketing of the product in that Party. Any restoration under this subparagraph 




shall confer all of the exclusive rights of a patent subject to the same limitations 
and exceptions applicable to the original patent. 


7. Each Party shall disregard information contained in public disclosures used to determine if an invention is novel or has an inventive step if the public disclosure (a) was made or 

authorized by, or derived from, the patent applicant, and (b) occurred within 12 months prior to the date of filing of the application in the territory of the Party. 

8. Each Party shall provide patent applicants with at least one opportunity to make amendments, corrections, and observations in connection with their applications.  Each Party shall provide that no amendment or correction shall introduce new matter into the disclosure of the invention as filed in the original application. 


9. Each Party shall provide that a disclosure of a claimed invention shall be considered to be sufficiently clear and complete if it provides information that allows the invention to be carried out by a person skilled in the art, without undue experimentation, as of the filing date and may require the applicant to indicate the best mode for carrying out the invention known to the inventor as of the filing date. 


10. With the aim of ensuring that the claimed invention is sufficiently described, each Party shall provide that a claimed invention is sufficiently supported by its disclosure if the disclosure reasonably conveys to a person skilled in the art that the applicant was in possession of the claimed invention as of the filing date. 


11. Each Party shall provide that a claimed invention is industrially applicable if it has a specific, substantial, and credible utility.

(c) 	sufficient time and opportunity for a patent holder to seek, prior to the marketing of an allegedly infringing product, available remedies for an infringing product. 
4. Where a Party permits, as a condition of approving the marketing of a pharmaceutical product, persons, other than the person originally submitting safety or efficacy information, to rely on evidence of safety or efficacy information of a product that was previously approved, such as evidence of prior marketing approval in the territory of the Party or in another territory, the Party may implement the provisions of paragraph 3 by:  


(a) 	implementing measures in its marketing approval process to prevent such other persons from marketing a product covered by a patent claiming the product or its approved method of use during the term of that patent, unless by consent or acquiescence of the patent owner;

(a) 	to put in place a judicial system for the enforcement of intellectual property rights distinct from that for the enforcement of law in general; or 


(b) 	with respect to the distribution of resources for enforcement of intellectual property rights and the enforcement of law in general. 
The Parties understand that a decision that a Party makes on the distribution of enforcement resources shall not be a reason for not complying with the provisions of this Chapter.  

5. In civil, administrative, and criminal proceedings involving copyright or related rights, each Party shall provide for a presumption that, in the absence of proof to the contrary, the person whose name is indicated in the usual manner is the right holder in the work, performance, or phonogram as designated.
21
 Each Party shall also provide for a presumption that, in the absence of proof to the contrary, the copyright or related right subsists in such subject matter. 

Civil and Administrative Procedures and Remedies  


6. Each Party shall make available to right holders
22
 civil judicial procedures concerning the enforcement of any intellectual property right. 


7. 	Each Party shall provide that: 
20  A Party may satisfy the requirement for publication by making the decision or ruling available to the public on the Internet. 

21  For greater certainty, the Parties recognize that this provision does not address the allocation of rights among the right holders. 

22  For purposes of this Article, “right holder” includes federations and associations as well as exclusive licensees and other duly authorized licensees having the legal standing and authority to assert such rights. “Licensee” shall include the licensee of any one or more of the exclusive intellectual property rights. 


(a) 	in civil judicial proceedings, its judicial authorities shall have the authority to order the infringer to pay the right holder: 


(i) 	damages adequate to compensate for the injury the right holder has suffered as a result of the infringement; and 


(ii) 	at least in the case of copyright or related rights infringement and trademark counterfeiting, the profits of the infringer that are attributable to the infringement and that are not taken into account in computing the amount of the damages referred to in clause (i); and  

(b) 	in determining the amount of damages for infringement of intellectual property rights, its judicial authorities shall consider, inter alia, the value of the infringed-on good or service, according to the suggested retail price or other legitimate measure of value submitted by the right holder.  

8. In civil judicial proceedings, each Party shall, at least with respect to infringement concerning copyright or related rights and trademark counterfeiting, establish or maintain preestablished damages, which shall be available on the election of the right holder as an alternative to actual damages. Such pre-established damages shall be set out in domestic law and determined by the judicial authorities, taking into account the aims of the intellectual property system, in an amount sufficient to compensate the right holder for the harm caused by the infringement and constitute a deterrent to future infringements.
23 



9. Each Party shall provide that its judicial authorities, except in exceptional circumstances, shall have the authority to order, at the conclusion of civil judicial proceedings concerning infringement of copyright or related rights and trademark infringement, that the prevailing party shall be awarded payment of court costs or fees and reasonable attorney’s fees by the losing party. 


10. In civil judicial proceedings concerning copyright and related rights infringement and trademark counterfeiting, each Party shall provide that its judicial authorities shall have the authority to order the seizure of suspected infringing goods, any related materials and implements, and, at least for trademark counterfeiting, documentary evidence relevant to the infringement. 


11. 	Each Party shall provide that: 


(a) 	in civil judicial proceedings, at the right holder’s request, goods that have been found to be pirated or counterfeit shall be destroyed, except in exceptional circumstances; 


(b) 	its judicial authorities shall have the authority to order that materials and implements that have been used in the manufacture or creation of such pirated or counterfeit goods be, without compensation of any sort, promptly destroyed or, in exceptional circumstances, without compensation of any sort, disposed of outside the channels of commerce in such a manner as to minimize the risks of further infringements; and 


(c) 	in regard to counterfeit trademarked goods, the simple removal of the trademark unlawfully affixed shall not be sufficient to permit the release of goods into the channels of commerce. 

12. Each Party shall provide that in civil judicial proceedings concerning the enforcement of intellectual property rights, its judicial authorities shall have the authority to order the infringer to provide any information that the infringer possesses regarding any person or persons involved in any aspect of the infringement and regarding the means of production or distribution channel of such goods or services, including the identification of third persons involved in the production and distribution of the infringing goods or services or in their channels of distribution, and to provide this information to the right holder.
24 



13. Each Party shall provide that the judicial authorities shall have the authority to order the infringer to inform the right holder of the identity of third persons involved in the production and distribution of the infringing goods or services and their channels of distribution.  Each Party shall provide that its judicial authorities shall have the authority to impose sanctions, in appropriate cases, on a party to a proceeding that fails to abide by valid orders issued by such authorities. 


14. To the extent that any civil remedy can be ordered as a result of administrative procedures on the merits of a case, each Party shall provide that such procedures conform to principles equivalent in substance to those set out in this Chapter. 


15. 	Each Party shall provide for civil remedies concerning the acts described in Articles 
23  For greater certainty, the Parties understand that the damages set forth in this paragraph do not constitute punitive damages. 

16.7.4 and 16.7.5. Available civil remedies shall include at least:  


(a) 	provisional measures, including seizure of devices and products suspected of being involved in the prohibited activity; 


(b) 	the opportunity for the right holder to elect between actual damages (plus any profits attributable to the prohibited activity not taken into account in computing those damages) or pre-established damages as provided in paragraph 8;  
24  For greater certainty, this provision does not apply to the extent that it would conflict with constitutional, common law, or statutory privilege.  


(c) 	payment to the prevailing right holder at the conclusion of civil judicial proceedings of court costs and fees, and reasonable attorney’s fees, by the party engaged in the prohibited conduct; and 


(d) 	destruction of devices and products found to be involved in the prohibited activity, at the discretion of the judicial authorities, as provided in subparagraphs 
(a) and (b) of paragraph 11. 

No Party may make damages under this paragraph available against a nonprofit library, archive, educational institution, or public broadcasting entity that sustains the burden of proving that it was not aware and had no reason to believe that its acts constituted a prohibited activity.  


16. In civil judicial proceedings concerning the enforcement of intellectual property rights, each Party shall provide that its judicial authorities shall have the authority to order a party to desist from an infringement, in order, inter alia, to prevent the entry into the channels of commerce in the jurisdiction of those authorities of imported goods that involve the infringement of an intellectual property right immediately after customs clearance of such goods, or to prevent their exportation. 


17. In the event that a Party’s judicial or other authorities appoint technical or other experts in civil proceedings concerning the enforcement of intellectual property rights and require that the parties to the litigation bear the costs of such experts, the Party should seek to ensure that such costs are closely related, inter alia, to the quantity and nature of work to be performed and do not unreasonably deter recourse to such proceedings. 
Provisional Measures 


18. Each Party shall act on requests for relief in audita altera parte and execute such requests expeditiously according to its rules of judicial procedure.  


19. Each Party shall provide that its judicial authorities shall have the authority to require the plaintiff to provide any reasonably available evidence in order to satisfy themselves with a sufficient degree of certainty that the plaintiff’s right is being infringed or that such infringement is imminent, and to order the plaintiff to provide a reasonable security or equivalent assurance sufficient to protect the defendant and to prevent abuse, and so as not to unreasonably deter recourse to such procedures. 
Special Requirements Related to Border Measures 

20. Each Party shall provide that any right holder initiating procedures for its competent authorities to suspend release of suspected counterfeit or confusingly similar trademark goods, or pirated copyright goods,
25
 into free circulation is required to provide adequate evidence to satisfy 

25  For purposes of paragraphs 20 through 25: 

the competent authorities that, under the laws of the country of importation, there is prima facie an infringement of the right holder’s intellectual property right and to supply sufficient information that may reasonably be expected to be within the right holder’s knowledge to make the suspected goods reasonably recognizable by its competent authorities.  The requirement to provide sufficient information shall not unreasonably deter recourse to these procedures.  


21. Each Party shall provide that the competent authorities shall have the authority to require a right holder initiating procedures to suspend the release of suspected counterfeit or confusingly similar trademarked goods, or pirated copyright goods, to provide a reasonable security or equivalent assurance sufficient to protect the defendant and the competent authorities and to prevent abuse. Each Party shall provide that such security or equivalent assurance shall not unreasonably deter recourse to these procedures.  Each Party may provide that such security may be in the form of a bond conditioned to hold the importer or owner of the imported merchandise harmless from any loss or damage resulting from any suspension of the release of goods in the event the competent authorities determine that the article is not an infringing good. 


22. Where its competent authorities have made a determination that goods are counterfeit or pirated, a Party shall grant its competent authorities the authority to inform the right holder of the names and addresses of the consignor, the importer, and the consignee, and of the quantity of the goods in question. 


23. Each Party shall provide that its competent authorities may initiate border measures ex officio with respect to merchandise for importation, exportation, or in transit, without the need for a formal complaint from a private party or right holder.  Such measures shall be used when there is reason to believe or suspect that such merchandise is counterfeit or pirated. 


24. Each Party shall provide that goods that have been determined by its competent authorities to be pirated or counterfeit shall be destroyed, pursuant to a judicial order where required, unless the right holder consents to an alternate disposition.  Counterfeit trademark goods may, in appropriate cases, be donated to charity for use outside the channels of commerce, when the removal of the trademark eliminates the infringing characteristic of the good and the good is no longer identifiable with the removed trademark.  In regard to counterfeit trademark goods, the simple removal of the trademark unlawfully affixed shall not be sufficient to permit the release of the goods into the channels of commerce.  In no event shall the competent authorities be authorized to permit the exportation of counterfeit or pirated goods, nor shall they 

(a) counterfeit trademark goods means any goods, including packaging, bearing without authorization a trademark that is identical to the trademark validly registered in respect of such goods, or that cannot be distinguished in its essential aspects from such a trademark, and that thereby infringes the rights of the owner of the trademark in question under the law of the country of importation; and 


(b) pirated copyright goods means any goods that are copies made without the consent of the right holder or person duly authorized by the right holder in the country of production and that are made directly or indirectly from an article where the making of that copy would have constituted an infringement of a copyright or a related right under the law of the country of importation. 
be authorized to permit such goods to be subject to other customs procedures, except in exceptional circumstances. 

25. When a Party establishes, in relation to border measures to obtain the enforcement of an intellectual property right, an application fee or merchandise storage fee, such fee shall not be set at an amount that unreasonably deters recourse to these measures. 

Criminal Procedures and Remedies 

26. Each Party shall provide for criminal procedures and penalties to be applied at least in cases of willful trademark counterfeiting or copyright or related rights piracy on a commercial scale. Willful copyright or related rights piracy on a commercial scale includes: 


(a) 	significant willful copyright or related rights infringements that have no direct or indirect motivation of financial gain; and 


(b) 	willful infringements for purposes of commercial advantage or private financial gain. 
Each Party shall treat willful importation or exportation of counterfeit or pirated goods as unlawful activities subject to criminal penalties to the same extent as the trafficking or distribution of such goods in domestic commerce. 

27. 	Specifically, each Party shall provide: 


(a) 	remedies that include sentences of imprisonment as well as monetary fines sufficient to provide a deterrent to future infringements, consistent with a policy of removing the monetary incentive of the infringer.  Each Party shall encourage its judicial authorities to impose fines at levels sufficient to provide a deterrent to future infringements;
26 



(b) 	that its judicial authorities shall have the authority to order the seizure of suspected counterfeit or pirated goods, any related materials and implements that have been used in the commission of the offense, any assets traceable to the infringing activity,
27
 and any documentary evidence relevant to the offense.  Each Party shall provide that items that are subject to seizure pursuant to any such judicial order need not be individually identified so long as they fall within general categories specified in the order; 
26  For greater certainty, this provision is without prejudice to the autonomy of the judicial authorities. 

27  For greater certainty, each Party recognizes that such authority may be provided under its general domestic criminal law. 


(c) 	that its judicial authorities have the authority to order, among other measures, the forfeiture of any assets traceable to the infringing activity
25
 and shall, except in exceptional cases, order the forfeiture and destruction of all counterfeit or pirated goods, and, at least with respect to willful copyright or related rights piracy, order the forfeiture and destruction of materials and implements that have been used in the creation of infringing goods. Each Party shall further provide that such forfeiture and destruction shall occur without compensation of any kind to the defendant; and 


(d) 	that its authorities may initiate legal action ex officio with respect to the offenses described in this Chapter, without the need for a formal complaint by a private party or right holder. 
28. Each Party shall also provide for criminal procedures and penalties to be applied in the following cases, even absent willful trademark counterfeiting or copyright piracy: 


(a) 	knowing trafficking in counterfeit labels affixed or designed to be affixed to a phonogram, a copy of a computer program, documentation or packaging for a computer program, or a copy of a motion picture or other audiovisual work; and  


(b) 	knowing trafficking in counterfeit documentation or packaging for a computer program.  
Limitations on Liability for Service Providers 

29.  For the purpose of providing enforcement procedures that permit effective action against any act of copyright infringement covered under this Chapter, including expeditious remedies to prevent infringements and criminal and civil remedies, each Party shall provide, consistent with the framework set out in this Article:  


(a) 	legal incentives for service providers to cooperate with copyright
28
 owners in deterring the unauthorized storage and transmission of copyrighted materials; and 


(b) 	limitations in its law regarding the scope of remedies available against service providers for copyright infringements that they do not control, initiate or direct, and that take place through systems or networks controlled or operated by them or on their behalf, as set forth in this subparagraph (b).
29 

28  For purposes of this paragraph, “copyright” shall also include related rights. 

29  For greater certainty, the failure of a service provider to qualify for the limitations in subparagraph (b) does not itself result in liability.  Furthermore, subparagraph (b) is without prejudice to the availability of defenses to copyright infringement that are of general applicability. 


(i) 	These limitations shall preclude monetary relief and provide reasonable restrictions on court-ordered relief to compel or restrain certain actions for the following functions, and shall be confined to those functions:
30 



(A) 	transmitting, routing, or providing connections for material without modification of its content, or the intermediate and transient storage of such material in the course thereof; 


(B) 	caching carried out through an automatic process; 


(C) 	storage at the direction of a user of material residing on a system or network controlled or operated by or for the service provider; and 


(D) 	referring or linking users to an online location by using information location tools, including hyperlinks and directories. 

(ii) 	These limitations shall apply only where the service provider does not initiate the chain of transmission of the material, and does not select the material or its recipients (except to the extent that a function described in clause (i)(D) in itself entails some form of selection). 
(iii) 	Qualification by a service provider for the limitations as to each function in clauses (i)(A) through (D) shall be considered separately from qualification for the limitations as to each other function, in accordance with the conditions for qualification set forth in clauses (iv) through (vii).  

(iv) 	With respect to functions referred to in clause (i)(B), the limitations shall be conditioned on the service provider: 


(A) 	permitting access to cached material in significant part only to users of its system or network who have met conditions on user access to that material; 


(B) 	complying with rules concerning the refreshing, reloading, or other updating of the cached material when specified by the person making the material available online in accordance with a generally accepted industry standard data communications protocol for the system or network through which that person makes the material available; 
30  Each Party may request consultations with another Party to consider how to address under this paragraph functions of a similar nature that a Party identifies after the date of entry into force of this Agreement. 


(C) 	not interfering with technology consistent with industry standards accepted in the Party’s territory used at the originating site to obtain information about the use of the material, and not modifying its content in transmission to subsequent users; and 


(D) 	expeditiously removing or disabling access, on receipt of an effective notification of claimed infringement, to cached material that has been removed or access to which has been disabled at the originating site. 

(v) 	With respect to functions referred to in clauses (i)(C) and (D), the limitations shall be conditioned on the service provider:  


(A) 	not receiving a financial benefit directly attributable to the infringing activity, in circumstances where it has the right and ability to control such activity; 


(B) 	expeditiously removing or disabling access to the material residing on its system or network on obtaining actual knowledge of the infringement or becoming aware of facts or circumstances from which the infringement was apparent, such as through effective notifications of claimed infringement in accordance with clause (ix); and 


(C) 	publicly designating a representative to receive such notifications. 

(vi) 	Eligibility for the limitations in this subparagraph shall be conditioned on the service provider: 


(A) 	adopting and reasonably implementing a policy that provides for termination in appropriate circumstances of the accounts of repeat infringers; and 


(B) 	accommodating and not interfering with standard technical measures accepted in the Party’s territory that protect and identify copyrighted material, that are developed through an open, voluntary process by a broad consensus of copyright owners and service providers, that are available on reasonable and nondiscriminatory terms, and that do not impose substantial costs on service providers or substantial burdens on their systems or networks. 
(vii) 	Eligibility for the limitations in this subparagraph may not be conditioned on the service provider monitoring its service, or affirmatively seeking facts indicating infringing activity, except to the extent consistent with such technical measures. 

(viii) 	If the service provider qualifies for the limitations with respect to the function referred to in clause (i)(A), court-ordered relief to compel or restrain certain actions shall be limited to terminating specified accounts, or to taking reasonable steps to block access to a specific, non-domestic online location. If the service provider qualifies for the limitations with respect to any other function in clause (i), court-ordered relief to compel or restrain certain actions shall be limited to removing or disabling access to the infringing material, terminating specified accounts, and other remedies that a court may find necessary, provided that such other remedies are the least burdensome to the service provider among comparably effective forms of relief. Each Party shall provide that any such relief shall be issued with due regard for the relative burden to the service provider and harm to the copyright owner, the technical feasibility and effectiveness of the remedy and whether less burdensome, comparably effective enforcement methods are available.  Except for orders ensuring the preservation of evidence, or other orders having no material adverse effect on the operation of the service provider’s communications network, each Party shall provide that such relief shall be available only where the service provider has received notice of the court order proceedings referred to in this subparagraph and an opportunity to appear before the judicial authority. 


(ix) 	For purposes of the notice and take down process for the functions referred to in clauses (i)(C) and (D), each Party shall establish appropriate procedures for effective notifications of claimed infringement, and effective counter-notifications by those whose material is removed or disabled through mistake or misidentification.  Each Party shall also provide for monetary remedies against any person who makes a knowing material misrepresentation in a notification or counter-notification that causes injury to any interested party as a result of a service provider relying on the misrepresentation.  


(x) 	If the service provider removes or disables access to material in good faith based on claimed or apparent infringement, each Party shall provide that the service provider shall be exempted from liability for any resulting claims, provided that, in the case of material residing on its system or network, it takes reasonable steps promptly to notify the person making the material available on its system or network that it has done so and, if such person makes an effective counter-notification and is subject to jurisdiction in an infringement suit, to restore the material online unless 

the person giving the original effective notification seeks judicial relief within a reasonable time.   

(xi) 	Each Party shall establish an administrative or judicial procedure enabling copyright owners who have given effective notification of claimed infringement to obtain expeditiously from a service provider information in its possession identifying the alleged infringer. 
(xii) 	For purposes of the function referred to in clause (i)(A), service provider means a provider of transmission, routing, or connections for digital online communications without modification of their content between or among points specified by the user of material of the user’s choosing, and for purposes of the functions referred to in clauses (i)(B) through (D) service provider means a provider or operator of facilities for online services or network access.</article>

2. 	The Parties have reached the following understandings regarding this Chapter. 


(a) 	The obligations of this Chapter do not and should not prevent a Party from taking measures to protect public health by promoting access to medicines for all, in particular concerning cases such as HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis, malaria, and other epidemics as well as circumstances of extreme urgency or national emergency.  Accordingly, while reiterating their commitment to this Chapter, the Parties affirm that this Chapter can and should be interpreted and implemented in a manner supportive of each Party’s right to protect public health and, in particular, to promote access to medicines for all.  


(b) 	In recognition of the commitment to access to medicines that are supplied in accordance with the Decision of the General Council of 30 August 2003 on the Implementation of Paragraph Six of the Doha Declaration on the TRIPS Agreement and Public Health (WT/L/540) and the WTO General Council Chairman’s statement accompanying the Decision (JOB(03)/177, WT/GC/M/82) (collectively, the “TRIPS/health solution”), this Chapter does not and should not prevent the effective utilization of the TRIPS/health solution. 
(c) With respect to the aforementioned matters, if an amendment of the TRIPS Agreement enters into force with respect to the Parties and a Party’s application of a measure in conformity with that amendment violates this Chapter, the Parties shall immediately consult in order to adapt this Chapter as appropriate in the light of the amendment.</article>

The complaining Party may suspend benefits up to the level the panel has determined under paragraph 3 or, if the panel has not determined the level, the level the complaining Party has proposed to suspend under paragraph 2, unless the panel has determined that the Party complained against has eliminated the non-conformity or the nullification or impairment.

The disputing Parties shall consult, beginning no later than 10 days after the Party complained against provides notice, with a view to reaching agreement on the amount of the assessment.  If the disputing Parties are unable to reach an agreement within 30 days after consultations begin, the amount of the assessment shall be set at a level, in U.S. dollars, equal to 50 percent of the level of the benefits the panel has determined under paragraph 3 to be of equivalent effect or, if the panel has not determined the level, 50 percent of the level that the complaining Party has proposed to suspend under paragraph 2. 


7. Unless the Commission otherwise decides, a monetary assessment shall be paid to the complaining Party in U.S. dollars, or in an equivalent amount of the currency of the Party complained against, in equal, quarterly installments beginning 60 days after the Party complained against gives notice that it intends to pay an assessment.  Where the circumstances warrant, the Commission may decide that an assessment shall be paid into a fund established by the Commission and expended at the direction of the Commission for appropriate initiatives to facilitate trade between the disputing Parties including by further reducing unreasonable trade barriers or by assisting a disputing Party in carrying out its obligations under this Agreement. 


8. If the Party complained against fails to pay a monetary assessment, the complaining Party may suspend the application to the Party complained against of benefits in accordance with paragraph 4. 


9. Compensation, the payment of monetary assessments, and the suspension of benefits are intended as temporary measures pending the elimination of any non-conformity or nullification or impairment that the panel has found.</article>

The panel shall issue its report on the matter within 90 days after the Party complained against provides notice.
