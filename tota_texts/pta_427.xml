2. CPC (1) 84, the UN code used for describing computer and related services, covers the basic functions used to provide all computer and related services: 

(a) computer programmes defined as the sets of instructions required to 	make computers work and communicate (including their development and implementation); 


(b) data processing and storage, and 


(c) related services, such as consultancy and training services for staff of clients. 
Technological developments have led to the increased offering of those services as a bundle or package of related services that can include some or all of those basic functions. For example, services such as web- or domain-hosting, data mining services and grid computing each consist of a combination of basic computer services functions. 

3. Computer and related services, regardless of whether they are delivered via a network, including the internet, include all services that provide: 


(a) consulting, strategy, analysis, planning, specification, design, development, installation, implementation, integration, testing, debugging, updating, support, technical assistance, or management of or for computers or computer systems; 


(1) CPC means the Central Products Classification as set out in Statistical Office of the UN, Statistical Papers, Series M, No 77, CPC prov, 1991. 


(b) computer programmes defined as sets of instructions required to make computers work and communicate (in and of themselves), plus consulting, strategy, analysis, planning, specification, design, development, installation, implementation, integration, testing, debugging, updating, adaptation, maintenance, support, technical assistance, management or use of or for computer programs; or 


(c) data processing, data storage, data hosting or database services; or maintenance and 	repair services for office machinery and equipment, including computers; or training services for staff of clients, related to computer programmes, computers or computer systems, and not elsewhere classified. 
4. Computer and related services enable the provision of other services (e.g. banking) by both electronic and other means. However, there is an important distinction between the enabling service (e.g. web-hosting or application-hosting) and the content or core service that is being delivered electronically (e.g. banking). In such cases, the content or core service is not covered by CPC 84.

5. Where the regulatory authority determines that a relevant market is not effectively competitive, it shall identify and designate services suppliers with significant market power on that market and shall impose, maintain or amend specific regulatory obligations referred to in Article 107 of this Agreement as it is appropriate. Where the regulatory authority concludes that the market is effectively competitive it shall not impose or maintain any of the regulatory obligations referred to in Article 107 of this Agreement. 


6. Each Party shall ensure that a services supplier affected by the decision of a regulatory authority shall have a right to appeal against that decision to an appeal body that is independent of the parties involved in the decision. Each Party shall ensure that the merits of the case are duly taken into account. Pending the outcome of any such appeal, the decision of the regulator shall stand, unless the appeal body decides otherwise. Where the appeal body is not judicial in character, written reasons for its decision shall always be given and its decisions shall also be subject to review by an impartial and independent judicial authority. Decisions taken by appeal bodies shall be effectively enforced. 


7. Each Party shall ensure that where the regulatory authorities intend to take measures related to any of the provisions of this Sub-Section and which have a significant impact to the relevant market, they give the interested parties the opportunity to comment on the draft measure within a reasonable period of time. Regulators shall publish their consultation procedures. The results of the consultation procedure shall be made publicly available except in the case of confidential information. 


8.

Licence fees for the use of radio spectrum and numbering resources are not subject to the requirements of this paragraph.</article>
      <article number="ARTICLE 107" name="Access And Interconnection" article_identifier="37042">1. Each Party shall ensure that any services suppliers authorised to provide electronic communication services have the right and obligation to negotiate access and interconnection with suppliers of publicly available electronic communication networks and services. Access and interconnection should in principle be agreed on the basis of commercial negotiation between the services suppliers concerned. 


2. Each Party shall ensure that services suppliers that acquire information from another services supplier during the process of negotiating interconnection arrangements use that information solely for the purpose for which it was supplied and respect at all times the confidentiality of information transmitted or stored. 


3. Each Party shall ensure that upon the finding in accordance with Article 105 of this Agreement that a relevant market is not effectively competitive, the regulatory authority shall have the power to impose on the supplier designated as having significant market power one or more of the following obligations in relation to interconnection and/or access: 

(a) obligation 	on non-discrimination to ensure that the operator applies equivalent conditions in equivalent circumstances to other suppliers providing equivalent services, and provides services and information to others under the same conditions and of the same quality as it provides for its own services, or those of its subsidiaries or partners; 


(b) obligation of a vertically integrated company to make transparent its wholesale prices and its internal transfer prices, where there is a requirement for non-discrimination or for prevention of unfair cross-subsidy. The regulatory authority may specify the format and accounting methodology to be used; 


(c) obligations to meet reasonable requests for access to, and use of, specific network elements and associated facilities, including unbundled access to the local loop, inter alia, in situations where the regulatory authority considers that denial of access or unreasonable terms and conditions having a similar effect would hinder the emergence of a sustainable competitive market at the retail level, or would not be in the end user's interest. 

Regulatory authorities may attach conditions covering fairness, reasonableness and timeliness to the obligations included under this point; 

(d) to 	provide specified services on a wholesale basis for resale by third parties; to grant open access to technical interfaces, protocols or other key technologies that are indispensable for the interoperability of services or virtual network services; to provide co-location or other forms of facility sharing, including duct, building or mast sharing; to provide specified services needed to ensure interoperability of end-to-end services to users, including facilities for intelligent network services; to provide access to operational support systems or similar software systems necessary to ensure fair competition in the provision of services; to interconnect networks or network facilities. 


(1) Licence fees do not include payments for auction, tendering or other non-discriminatory means of awarding concessions, or mandated contributions to universal service provision. 
Regulatory authorities may attach conditions covering fairness, reasonableness and timeliness to the obligations included under this point; 


(e) obligations relating to cost recovery and price controls, including obligations for cost orientation of prices and obligations concerning cost accounting systems, for the provision of specific types of interconnection and/or access, in situations where a market analysis indicates that a lack of effective competition means that the operator concerned might sustain prices at an excessively high level, or apply a price squeeze, to the detriment of end-users. 

Regulatory authorities shall take into account the investment made by the operator and allow the operator a reasonable rate of return on adequate capital employed, taking into account the risks involved; 

(f) 	to publish the specific obligations imposed on services suppliers by the regulatory authority identifying the specific product/service and geographical markets. Up-to-date information, provided that it is not confidential and it does not comprise business secrets is made publicly available in a manner that guarantees all interested parties easy access to that information; 


(g) obligations for transparency requiring operators to make public specified information and, in particular, where an operator has obligations of non-discrimination, the regulator may require that operator to publish a reference offer, which shall be sufficiently unbundled to ensure that services suppliers are not required to pay for facilities which are not necessary for the service requested, giving a description of the relevant offerings broken down into components according to market needs, and the associated terms and conditions including prices. 
4. Each Party shall ensure that a service supplier requesting interconnection with a supplier designated as having significant market power shall have recourse, either at any time or after a reasonable period of time which has been made publicly known, to an independent domestic body, which may be a regulatory body as referred to in Article 104(2)(d) of this Agreement, to resolve disputes regarding terms and conditions for interconnection and/or access.</article>

Each Party shall ensure that any procedures for the allocation and use of scarce resources, including frequencies, numbers and rights of way, shall be carried out in an objective, proportionate, timely, transparent and non-discriminatory manner. The current state of allocated frequency bands shall be made publicly available, but detailed identification of frequencies allocated for specific government uses is not required. 


2. Each Party shall ensure the effective management of radio frequencies for electronic communication services in their territory with a view to ensure effective and efficient use of the spectrum. Where demand for specific frequencies exceeds their availability, appropriate and transparent procedures shall be followed for the assignment of these frequencies in order to optimise their use and facilitate the development of competition. 


3. Each Party shall ensure that the assignment of national numbering resources and the management of the national numbering plans are entrusted to the regulatory authority. 


4.

The administration of such obligations shall also be neutral with respect to competition and be not more burdensome than necessary for the kind of universal service defined by the Party. 


3. Each Party shall ensure that all suppliers should be eligible to ensure universal service and no services supplier shall be a priori excluded. The designation shall be made through an efficient, transparent, objective and non-discriminatory mechanism. Where necessary, each Party shall assess whether the provision of universal service represents an unfair burden on organisation(s) designated to provide universal service. Where justified on the basis of such calculation, and taking into account the market benefit, if any, which accrues to an organisation that offers the universal service, regulatory authorities shall determine whether a mechanism is required to compensate the services supplier(s) concerned or to share the net cost of universal service obligations.

2. This Chapter envisages mutual access to public procurement markets on the basis of the principle of national treatment at national, regional and local level for public contracts and concessions in the traditional sector as well as in the utilities sector. It provides for a gradual approximation of the public procurement legislation in Georgia with the Union public procurement acquis based on the principles governing public procurement in the Union and the terms and definitions set out in Directive 2004/18/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 31 March 2004 on the coordination of procedures for the award of public works contracts, public supply contracts and public service contracts (Directive 2004/18/EC) and Directive 2004/17/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 31 March 2004 coordinating the procurement procedures of entities operating in the water, energy, transport and postal services sectors (Directive 2004/17/EC).</article>

This Chapter applies to any contracting authority and any contracting entity which meets the definitions of the Union public procurement acquis (hereinafter referred to as ‘the contracting entities’). It covers also bodies governed by public law and public undertakings in the field of utilities such as state-owned enterprises carrying out the relevant activities and private undertakings operating on the basis of special and exclusive rights in the field of utilities (1). 


3. This Chapter applies to contracts above the value thresholds set out in Annex XVI-A to this Agreement. 
(1) The expression ‘private undertakings operating on the basis of special and exclusive rights’ shall be interpreted in accordance with the European Commission's Explanatory Note CC/2004/33 of 18 June 2004. 


4. The calculation of the estimated value of a public contract shall be based on the total amount payable, net of taxes on value added. When applying these thresholds, Georgia shall calculate and convert contract values into its national currency, using the conversion rate of its national bank. 


5. Value thresholds shall be revised regularly every two years, beginning in the year of entry into force of this Agreement, based on the average daily value of the euro, expressed in Special Drawing Rights, over the 24 months terminating on the last day of August preceding the revision with effect from January 1. The value of the thresholds thus revised shall, where necessary, be rounded down to nearest thousand euro.

3. Each Party shall ensure that decisions taken by the authorities responsible for the review of complaints by economic operators concerning infringements of domestic law shall be effectively enforced.</article>

No later than three years from the entry into force of this Agreement, the Parties shall comply with a set of basic standards for the award of all contracts as stipulated in paragraphs 2 to 15 of this Article. These basic standards derive directly from the rules and principles of public procurement, as regulated in the Union public procurement acquis, including the principles of non-discrimination, equal treatment, transparency and proportionality. 


Publication 

2. Each Party shall ensure that all intended procurements are published in an appropriate media (1) in a manner that is sufficient: 


(a) to enable the market to be opened up to competition; and 


(b) to 	allow any interested economic operator to have appropriate access to information regarding the intended procurement prior to the award of the contract and to express its interest in obtaining the contract. 

3. The publication shall be appropriate to the economic interest of the contract to economic operators. 


4. The publication shall contain at least the essential details of the contract to be awarded, the criteria for qualitative selection, the award method, the contract award criteria and any other additional information that the economic operators reasonably need to decide whether to express their interest in obtaining the contract. 
Award of contracts 

5. All contracts shall be awarded through transparent and impartial award procedures that prevent corruptive practices. This impartiality shall be ensured in particular through the non-discriminatory description of the subject matter of the contract, equal access for all economic operators, appropriate time-limits and a transparent and objective approach. 


(1) Wherever Union legislation that is subject to the process of approximation under this Chapter makes reference to publication in the Official Journal of the European Union, it is understood that in Georgia such publication shall be in the official means of publication of Georgia. 


6. When describing the characteristics of the required work, supply or service, the contracting entities shall use general descriptions of performance and functions and international, European or national standards. 


7. The description of the characteristics required of a work, supply or service shall not refer to a specific make or source, or a particular process, or to trademarks, patents, types or a specific origin or production unless such a reference is justified by the subject matter of the contract and accompanied by the words ‘or equivalent’. Preference shall be given to the use of general descriptions of performance or functions. 


8. Contracting entities shall not impose conditions resulting in direct or indirect discrimination against the economic operators of the other Party, such as the requirement that economic operators interested in the contract must be established in the same country, region or territory as the contracting entity. 

Notwithstanding the above, in cases where it is justified by the specific circumstances of the contract, the successful applicant may be required to establish certain business infrastructure at the place of performance. 

9. The time-limits for expression of interest and for submission of offers shall be sufficiently long to allow economic operators from the other Party to make a meaningful assessment of the tender and prepare their offer. 


10. All participants must be able to know the applicable rules, selection criteria and award criteria in advance. Those rules must apply equally to all participants. 


11. Contracting entities may invite a limited number of applicants to submit an offer, provided that: 

(a) this is done in a transparent and non-discriminatory manner; and 


(b) the selection is based only on objective factors such as the experience of the applicants in the sector concerned, the size and infrastructure of their businesses or their technical and professional abilities. 
In inviting a limited number of applicants to submit an offer, account shall be taken of the need to ensure adequate competition. 


12. Contracting entities may use negotiated procedures only in exceptional and defined cases when the use of such a procedure effectively does not distort competition. 


13. Contracting entities may use qualification systems only under the condition that the list of qualified operators is compiled by means of a sufficiently advertised, transparent and open procedure. Contracts falling within the scope of such a system shall be awarded also on a non-discriminatory basis. 


14. Each Party shall ensure that contracts are awarded in a transparent manner to the applicant who has submitted the economically most advantageous offer or the offer with the lowest price, based on the tender criteria and the procedural rules established and communicated in advance. The final decisions shall be communicated to all applicants without undue delay. Upon request of an unsuccessful applicant, reasons must be provided in sufficient detail to allow the review of such a decision. 
Judicial protection 

15. Each Party shall ensure that any person having or having had an interest in obtaining a particular contract and who has been, or risks, being harmed by an alleged infringement is entitled to effective, impartial judicial protection against any decision of the contracting entity related to the award of that contract. The decisions taken in the course and at the end of such review procedure shall be made public in a manner that is sufficient to inform all interested economic operators.</article>

2. A design applied to or incorporated in a product which constitutes a component part of a complex product shall only be considered to be new and original: 

(a) if the component part, once it has been incorporated into the complex product, remains visible during normal use of the latter, and 


(b) to the extent that those visible features of the component part fulfil in themselves the requirements as to novelty and originality. 

3. The expression ‘normal use’ in point (a) of paragraph 2 shall mean use by the end user, excluding maintenance, servicing or repair work. 


4. The holder of a registered design shall have the right to prevent third parties not having the owner's consent from, at a minimum, making, offering for sale, selling, importing, exporting, stocking or using a product bearing or embodying the protected design when such acts are undertaken for commercial purposes, unduly prejudice the normal exploitation of the design, or are not compatible with fair trade practices. 


5. The duration of protection available shall amount to 25 years, from the date of filing of the application for registration or from a date established in accordance with the Hague Agreement Concerning the International Deposit of Industrial Designs, without prejudice to the Paris Convention.</article>

Each Party may provide limited exceptions to the protection of designs, provided that such exceptions do not unreasonably conflict with the normal exploitation of protected designs and do not unreasonably prejudice the legitimate interests of the owner of the protected design, taking account of the legitimate interests of third parties. 


(1) For the purposes of this Article, a Party may consider that a design having individual character is original. 

2. Design protection shall not extend to designs dictated essentially by technical or functional considerations. In particular a design right shall not subsist in features of appearance of a product which are required to be reproduced in their exact form and dimensions in order to permit the product in which the design is incorporated or to which it is applied to be mechanically connected to or placed in, around or against another product so that either product may perform its function.</article>
      <article number="ARTICLE 183" name="Relationship To Copyright" article_identifier="37118">A design shall also be eligible for protection under the law of copyright of a Party as from the date on which the design was created or fixed in any form. The extent to which, and the conditions under which, such a protection is conferred, including the level of originality required, shall be determined by each Party.
