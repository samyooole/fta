PREAMBLE 


The Republic of Austria, the Republic of Finland, the Republic of 
Iceland, the Principality of Liechtenstein, the Kingdom of Norway, the 
Kingdom of Sweden, the Swiss Confederation (hereinafter called the EFTA 
States) 


and 


the Czech and Slovak Federal Republic (hereinafter called the CSFR), 


Recalling their intention to participate actively in the process of 
economic integration in Europe and expressing their preparedness to 
co-operate in seeking ways and means to strengthen this process,

States and the CSFR and the common values they share, and recognizing that 
the EFTA States and the CSFR wish to strengthen these links and to 
establish close and lasting relations, 


Having regard to the Declaration signed by the EFTA States and the 
CSFR in Gothenburg in June 1990, 


Recalling their firm commitment to the Final Act of the Conference on

and in particular the principles contained in the final document of the 
CSCE Bonn Conference on Economic Co-operation in Europe, 


Reaffirming their commitment to pluralistic democracy based on the 
rule of law, human rights and fundamental freedoms, and recalling their 
membership in the Council of Europe, 


Firmly convinced that this Agreement will foster the creation of an 
enlarged and harmonious free trade area within Europe, thus constituting an 
important contribution to European integration, 


Resolved to this end to eliminate progressively the obstacles to 
substantially all their trade, in accordance with the General Agreement on 
Tariffs and Trade, 


Declaring their readiness to examine, in the light of any relevant 
factor, the possibility of developing and deepening their relations in 
order to extend them to fields not covered by this Agreement,

CSFR shall provide the Joint Committee with a schedule for the elimination 
of the customs duties introduced under this Article. This schedule shall 
provide for a phasing out of these duties starting at the latest two years

difficulties, or under imminent threat thereof, the EFTA State or the CSFR, 
as the case may be, may, in accordance with the conditions established 
under the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, adopt trade restrictive 
measures, which shall be of limited duration and may not go beyond what is 
necessary to remedy the balance-of-payments situation. The measures shall 
be progressively relaxed as balance-of-payments conditions improve and they 
shall be eliminated when conditions no longer justify this maintenance. 
The EFTA State or the CSFR, as the case my be, shall inform the other 
States Parties to this Agreement and the Joint Committee forthwith of their 
introduction and, whenever practicable, of a time schedule for their 
removal.
