6. When it decides a respondent’s objection under paragraphs 4 or 5, the tribunal may, if warranted, award to the prevailing disputing party reasonable costs and attorneys’ fees incurred in submitting or opposing the objection.

Each Party shall provide that its competent authorities shall have the authority to require an applicant to provide a reasonable security or equivalent assurance sufficient to protect the defendant and the competent authorities and to prevent abuse. Each Party shall provide that the security or assurance shall not unreasonably deter recourse to these procedures. 
16 For the purposes of this Chapter: 


(a) counterfeit trademark goods shall mean any goods, including packaging, bearing without authorization a trademark which is identical to the trademark validly registered in respect of such goods, or which cannot be distinguished in its essential aspects from such a trademark, and which thereby infringes the rights of the owner of the trademark in question under the law of the country of importation; and 


(b) pirated copyright goods shall mean any goods which are copies made without the consent of the right holder or person duly authorized by the right holder in the country of production and which are made directly or indirectly from an article where the making of that copy would have constituted an infringement of a copyright or a related right under the law of the country of importation. 

18. Where its competent authorities have made a determination that goods are counterfeit or pirated, the Party shall grant its competent authorities the authority to inform the right holder of the names and addresses of the consignor, the importer, and the consignee, and of the quantity of the goods in question. 


19. Each Party shall provide that its competent authorities may initiate border measures ex officio, without the need for a formal complaint from a private party or right holder. Such measures shall apply to shipments of pirated and counterfeit goods imported into or exported out of a Party’s territory, including shipments consigned to a local party. For transshipped goods that are not consigned to a local party, each Party shall, upon request, endeavor to examine such goods. For products transshipped through the territory of a Party destined for the territory of the other Party, the former shall cooperate to provide all available information to the latter Party to enable effective enforcement against shipments of counterfeit or pirated goods.  Each Party shall ensure that it has the authority to undertake such cooperation in response to a request by the other Party on counterfeit or pirated goods en route to that other Party. 


20. Each Party shall provide that goods that its competent authorities have determined to be pirated or counterfeit shall be destroyed, except in exceptional cases. In regard to counterfeit trademark goods, the simple removal of the trademark unlawfully affixed shall not be sufficient to permit the release of the goods into the channels of commerce.  In no event shall the competent authorities be authorized to permit the export of counterfeit or pirated goods. 
Criminal Procedures and Remedies for the Enforcement of Intellectual Property Rights 

21. Each Party shall provide criminal procedures and penalties to be applied at least in cases of willful trademark counterfeiting or copyright or related rights piracy on a commercial scale. Willful copyright or related rights piracy on a commercial scale includes (i) significant willful infringements of copyright or related rights that have no direct or indirect motivation of financial gain, as well as (ii) willful infringements for purposes of commercial advantage or financial gain. 


(a) 	Specifically, each Party shall provide: 


(i) 	remedies that include imprisonment as well as monetary fines sufficiently high to deter future acts of infringement consistent with a policy of removing the monetary incentive of the infringer. Also, each Party shall encourage its judicial authorities to impose such fines at levels sufficient to provide a deterrent to future infringements; 


(ii) 	that its judicial authorities have the authority to order the seizure of suspected counterfeit or pirated goods, any related materials and implements that have been used in the commission of the offense, any assets traceable to the infringing activity, and documentary evidence relevant to the offense that fall within the scope of such order. Items that are subject to seizure pursuant to such order need not be individually 
identified so long as they fall within general categories specified in the order; 

(iii) 	that its judicial authorities shall, except in exceptional cases, order the forfeiture and destruction of all counterfeit or pirated goods, and, at least with respect to willful copyright or related rights piracy, materials and implements that have been used in the creation of the infringing goods. Each Party shall further provide that such forfeiture and destruction shall occur without compensation of any kind to the defendant; and 

(iv) 	that its authorities may initiate legal action ex officio, without the need for a formal complaint by a private party or right holder. 

(b) 	Each Party may provide procedures for right holders to initiate private criminal actions.  However, these procedures shall not be unduly burdensome or costly for right holders. Each Party shall ensure that non-private criminal actions are the primary means by which it ensures the effective enforcement of its criminal law against willful copyright or related rights piracy.  In addition, each Party shall ensure that its competent authorities bring criminal actions, as necessary, to act as a deterrent to further infringements. 
Limitations on Liability for Service Providers 

22. 	Each Party shall provide, consistent with the framework set forth in Article 16.9: 


(a) 	legal incentives for service providers to cooperate with copyright16-17 owners in deterring the unauthorized storage and transmission of copyrighted materials; and 


(b) 	limitations in its law regarding the scope of remedies available against service providers for copyright infringements that they do not control, initiate, or direct, and that take place through systems or networks controlled or operated by them or on their behalf, as set forth in this subparagraph.16-18 
(i) 	These limitations shall preclude monetary relief and provide reasonable restrictions on court-ordered relief to compel or restrain certain actions for the following functions and shall be confined to those functions:16-19 

16-17 For purposes of Article 16.9.22, “copyright” shall also include related rights. 

16-18 It is understood that this subparagraph is without prejudice to the availability of defenses to copyright infringement that are of general applicability. 

16-19 Either Party may request consultations with the other Party to consider how to address future functions of a similar nature under this paragraph. 


(A) 	transmitting, routing or providing connections for material without modification of its content, or the intermediate and transient storage of such material in the course thereof; 


(B) 	caching carried out through an automatic process; 


(C) 	storage at the direction of a user of material residing on a system or network controlled or operated by or for the service provider; and 


(D) 	referring or linking users to an online location by using information location tools, including hyperlinks and directories. 
(ii) 	These limitations shall apply only where the service provider does not initiate the chain of transmission of the material, and does not select the material or its recipients (except to the extent that a function described in clause (i)(D) in itself entails some form of selection). 

(iii) 	Qualification by a service provider for the limitations as to each function in clauses (i)(A) through (i)(D) shall be considered separately from qualification for the limitations as to each other function, in accordance with the conditions for qualification set forth in subparagraphs (iv) – (vii). 


(iv) 	With respect to functions referred to in clause (i)(B), the limitations shall be conditioned on the service provider: 


(A) 	permitting access to cached material in significant part only to users of its system or network who have met conditions on user access to that material; 


(B) 	complying with rules concerning the refreshing, reloading, or other updating of the cached material when specified by the person making the material available online in accordance with a generally accepted industry standard data communications protocol for the system or network through which that person makes the material available; 


(C) 	not interfering with technology consistent with industry standards accepted in the territory of each Party used at the originating site to obtain information about the use of the material, and not modifying its content in transmission to subsequent users; and 


(D) 	expeditiously removing or disabling access, on receipt of an effective notification of claimed infringement, to cached material that has been removed or access to which has been disabled at the originating site. 

(v) 	With respect to functions referred to in clauses (i)(C) and (i)(D), the limitations shall be conditioned on the service provider: 


(A) 	not receiving a financial benefit directly attributable to the infringing activity, in circumstances where it has the right and ability to control such activity; 


(B) 	expeditiously removing or disabling access to the material residing on its system or network on obtaining actual knowledge of the infringement or becoming aware of facts or circumstances from which the infringement was apparent, such as through effective notifications of claimed infringement in accordance with subparagraph (ix) and 


(C) 	publicly designating a representative to receive such notifications. 

(vi) 	Eligibility for the limitations in this subparagraph shall be conditioned on the service provider: 


(A) 	adopting and reasonably implementing a policy that provides for termination in appropriate circumstances of the accounts of repeat infringers; and 


(B) 	accommodating and not interfering with standard technical measures accepted in the territory of each Party that protect and identify copyrighted material, that are developed through an open, voluntary process by a broad consensus of copyright owners and service providers, that are available on reasonable and nondiscriminatory terms, and that do not impose substantial costs on service providers or substantial burdens on their systems or networks. 
(vii) 	Eligibility for the limitations in this subparagraph may not be conditioned on the service provider monitoring its service, or affirmatively seeking facts indicating infringing activity, except to the extent consistent with such technical measures. 

(viii) 	If the service provider qualifies for the limitations with respect to the functions referred to in clause (i)(A), court-ordered relief to compel or restrain certain actions shall be limited to terminating specified accounts, or to taking reasonable steps to block access to a specific, non-domestic online location. If the service provider qualifies for the limitations with respect to any other function in clause (i), court-ordered relief to compel or restrain certain actions shall be limited to removing or disabling access to the infringing material, terminating specified accounts, and other remedies that a court may find necessary provided that such other 

remedies are the least burdensome to the service provider among 

comparably effective forms of relief. Each Party shall provide that any 

such relief shall be issued with due regard for the relative burden to the 

service provider and harm to the copyright owner, the technical feasibility 

and effectiveness of the remedy, and whether less burdensome, 

comparably effective enforcement methods are available. Except for 

orders ensuring the preservation of evidence, or other orders having no 

material adverse effect on the operation of the service provider=s 

communications network, each Party shall provide that such relief shall be 

available only where the service provider has received notice of the court 

order proceedings referred to in this subparagraph and an opportunity to 

appear before the judicial authority. 


(ix) 	For purposes of the notice and take down process for the functions referred to in clauses (i)(C) and (D), each Party shall establish appropriate procedures for effective notifications of claimed infringement, and effective counter-notifications by those whose material is removed or disabled through mistake or misidentification. Each Party shall also provide for monetary remedies against any person who makes a knowing material misrepresentation in a notification or counter-notification that causes injury to any interested party as a result of a service provider relying on the misrepresentation. 


(x) 	If the service provider removes or disables access to material in good faith based on claimed or apparent infringement, each Party shall provide that the service provider shall be exempted from liability for any resulting claims, provided that, in the case of material residing on its system or network, it takes reasonable steps promptly to notify the person making the material available on its system or network that it has done so and, if such person makes an effective counter-notification and is subject to jurisdiction in an infringement suit, to restore the material online unless the person giving the original effective notification seeks judicial relief within a reasonable time.  


(xi) 	Each Party shall establish an administrative or judicial procedure enabling copyright owners who have given effective notification of claimed infringement to obtain expeditiously from a service provider information in its possession identifying the alleged infringer.  
(xii) 	For purposes of the functions referred to in clause (i)(A), service provider means a provider of transmission, routing or connections for digital online communications without modification of their content between or among points specified by the user of material of the user=s choosing, and for purposes of the functions referred to in clauses (i)(B) through (i)(D) service provider means a provider or operator of facilities for online services or network access.</article>

5. If the Party complained against fails to pay a monetary assessment, and if the Party has created and funded an escrow account to ensure payment of any assessments against it, the other Party shall, before having recourse to any other measure, seek to obtain the funds from the account. 


6. If the complaining Party cannot obtain the funds from the other Party’s escrow account within 30 days of the date on which payment is due, or if the other Party has not created an escrow account, the complaining Party may take other appropriate steps to collect the assessment or otherwise secure compliance. These steps may include suspending tariff benefits under the Agreement as necessary to collect the assessment, while bearing in mind the Agreement’s objective of eliminating barriers to bilateral trade and while seeking to avoid unduly affecting parties or interests not party to the dispute.</article>

Articles 15.6 (Expropriation) and 15.15 shall apply to a taxation measure alleged to be an expropriation. However, no investor may invoke Article 15.6 as the basis for a claim where it has been determined pursuant to this paragraph that the measure is not an expropriation.  An investor that seeks to invoke Article 15.6 with respect to a taxation measure must first refer to the competent authorities described in paragraph 7, at the time that it gives notice under Article 15.15.2, the issue of whether that taxation measure involves an expropriation.  If the competent authorities do not agree to consider the issue or, having agreed to consider it, fail to agree that the measure is not an expropriation within a period of six months of such referral, the investor may submit its claim to arbitration under Article 15.15.4.
