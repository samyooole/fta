  Stabilisation and Association Committee and shall enter in
  consultations with Serbia to agree on measures designed to avoid trade
  distortion in trade of products listed in Annex V of Protocol 3.

  The Community shall restore the preferential treatment as soon as the
  trade distortion has been resolved by the effective implementation of

  one Party is being imported into the territory of the other Party in
  such increased quantities and under such conditions as to cause or
  threaten to cause:

  (a) serious injury to the domestic industry of like or directly

  which could bring about serious deterioration in the economic
  situation of a region of the importing Party,

  in this Article.

  3. Bilateral safeguard measures directed at imports from the other
  Party shall not exceed what is necessary to remedy the problems, as
  defined in paragraph 2, which have arisen as a result of application
  of this Agreement. The safeguard measure adopted should consist of a
  suspension in the increase or in the reduction of the margins of
  preferences provided for under this Agreement for the product
  concerned up to a maximum limit corresponding to the basic duty
  referred to in Article 18 paragraph 4(a) and (b) and paragraph 5 for
  the same product. Such measures shall contain clear elements
  progressively leading to their elimination at the end of the set
  period, at the latest, and shall not be taken for a period exceeding
  two years.

  In very exceptional circumstances, measures may be extended for a
  further period of maximum two years. No bilateral safeguard measure

  the measure.

  4. In the cases specified in this Article, before taking the measures
  provided for therein or, in the cases to which paragraph 5(b) of this
  Article applies, as soon as possible, the Community on the one part or
  Serbia on the other part, shall supply the Stabilisation and

  (a) the problems arising from the situation referred to in this

  If the Stabilisation and Association Council or the exporting Party
  has not taken a decision putting an end to the problems, or no other
  satisfactory solution has been reached within 30 days of the matter
  being referred to the Stabilisation and Association Council, the
  importing Party may adopt the appropriate measures to remedy the
  problem in accordance with this Article. In the selection of safeguard
  measures, priority must be given to those which least disturb the
  functioning of the arrangements established in this Agreement.
  Safeguard measures applied in accordance with Article XIX GATT 1994
  and the WTO Agreement on Safeguards shall preserve the level/margin of
  preference granted under this Agreement.

  (b) Where exceptional and critical circumstances requiring immediate
  action make prior information or examination, as the case may be,
  impossible, the Party concerned may, in the situations specified in
  this Article, apply forthwith provisional measures necessary to deal
  with the situation and shall inform the other Party immediately
  thereof.

  The safeguard measures shall be notified immediately to the
  Stabilisation and Association Council and shall be the subject of
  periodic consultations within that body, particularly with a view to
  establishing a timetable for their abolition as soon as circumstances

  duties or measures or charges having equivalent effect, and where the
  situations referred to above give rise, or are likely to give rise to
  major difficulties for the exporting Party

  that Party may take appropriate measures under the conditions and in
  accordance with the procedures laid down in this Article.

  least disturb the functioning of the arrangements in this Agreement.
  Such measures shall not be applied in a manner which would constitute
  a means of arbitrary or unjustifiable discrimination where the same
  conditions prevail, or a disguised restriction on trade and shall be
  eliminated when the conditions no longer justify their maintenance.

  3. Before taking the measures provided for in paragraph 1 or, as soon

  transitional period defined in Article 8 of this Agreement.

  3. Approximation will, at an early stage, focus on fundamental
  elements of the Internal Market acquis, Justice, Freedom and Security

  shall focus on the remaining parts of the acquis.

  Approximation shall be carried out on the basis of a programme to be

  Agreement, insofar as they may affect trade between the Community and

  (i) all Agreements between undertakings, decisions by associations of
  undertakings and concerted practices between undertakings which have
  as their object or effect the prevention, restriction or distortion of
  competition;

  (ii) abuse by one or more undertakings of a dominant position in the
  territories of the Community or Serbia as a whole or in a substantial
  part thereof;

  (iii) any State aid which distorts or threatens to distort competition
  by favouring certain undertakings or certain products.

  2. Any practices contrary to this Article shall be assessed on the
  basis of criteria arising from the application of the competition
  rules applicable in the Community, in particular from Articles 81, 82,
  86 and 87 of the EC Treaty and interpretative instruments adopted by
  the Community institutions.

  3. The Parties shall ensure that an operationally independent
  authority is entrusted with the powers necessary for the full
  application of paragraph 1(i) and (ii) of this Article, regarding
  private and public undertakings and undertakings to which special
  rights have been granted.

  4. Serbia shall establish an operationally independent authority which
  is entrusted with the powers necessary for the full application of
  paragraph 1(iii) within one year from the date of entry into force of
  this Agreement. This authority shall have, inter alia, the powers to
  authorise State aid schemes and individual aid grants in conformity
  with paragraph 2, as well as the powers to order the recovery of State
  aid that has been unlawfully granted.

  5. The Community on one side and Serbia on the other side shall ensure
  transparency in the area of State aid, inter alia, by providing to the
  other Parties a regular annual report, or equivalent, following the
  methodology and the presentation of the Community survey on State aid.
  Upon request by one Party, the other Party shall provide information
  on particular individual cases of public aid.

  6. Serbia shall establish a comprehensive inventory of aid schemes
  instituted before the establishment of the authority referred to in
  paragraph 4 and shall align such aid schemes with the criteria
  referred to in paragraph 2 within a period of no more than 4 years

  7. (a) For the purposes of applying the provisions of paragraph
  1(iii), the Parties recognise that during the first five years after
  the entry into force of this Agreement, any public aid granted by
  Serbia shall be assessed taking into account the fact that Serbia
  shall be regarded as an area identical to those areas of the Community
  described in Article 87(3)(a) of the EC Treaty.

  (b) Within four years from the entry into force of this Agreement,
  Serbia shall submit to the European Commission its GDP per capita
  figures harmonised at NUTS II level. The authority referred to in
  paragraph 4 and the European Commission shall then jointly evaluate
  the eligibility of the regions of Serbia as well as the maximum aid
  intensities in relation thereto in order to draw up the regional aid
  map on the basis of the relevant Community guidelines.

  8. As appropriate, Protocol 5 establishes the rules on state aid in
  the steel industry. This Protocol establishes the rules applicable in
  the event restructuring aid is granted to the steel industry. It would
  stress the exceptional character of such aid and the fact that the aid
  would be limited in time and would be linked to capacity reductions
  within the framework of feasibility programmes.

  9. With regard to products referred to in Chapter II of Title IV:

  (a) paragraph 1(iii) shall not apply;

  (b) any practices contrary to paragraph 1(i) shall be assessed

  Articles 36 and 37 of the EC Treaty and specific Community instruments

  10. If one of the Parties considers that a particular practice is
  incompatible with the terms of paragraph 1, it may take appropriate
  measures after consultation within the Stabilisation and Association
  Council or after 30 working days following referral for such
  consultation. Nothing in this Article shall prejudice or affect in any

  Council a formal request that the matter in dispute be resolved.

  Where a Party considers that a measure adopted by the other Party, or
  a failure of the other Party to act, constitutes a breach of its
  obligations under this Agreement, the formal request that the dispute
  be resolved shall give the reasons for this opinion and indicate, as
  the case may be, that the Party may adopt measures as provided for in
  Article 129, paragraph 4.

  2. The Parties shall endeavour to resolve the dispute by entering into
  good faith consultations within the Stabilisation and Association
  Council and other bodies as provided in paragraph 3, with the aim of

  the situation.

  arbitration procedure as provided for in Protocol 7 has been
  initiated. A dispute shall be deemed to be resolved when the
  Stabilisation and Association Council has taken a binding decision to
  settle the matter as provided for in Article 129, paragraph 3, or when
  it has declared that there is no dispute anymore.

  Consultations on a dispute can also be held at any meeting of the
  Stabilisation and Association Committee or any other relevant
  committee or body set up on the basis of Articles 123 or 124, as
  agreed between the Parties or at the request of any of the Parties.
  Consultations may also be held in writing.

  All information disclosed during the consultations shall remain
  confidential.

  4. For matters within the scope of application of Protocol 7, any
