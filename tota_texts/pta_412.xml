quantities, in absolute terms, and under such conditions
that the imports of that originating good constitute a
substantial cause of serious injury, or threat thereof, to
the domestic industry of the former Party. 



2. If the conditions in paragraph 1 are met, a Party may,
to the minimum extent necessary to prevent or remedy
serious injury, and facilitate adjustment:

necessary to prevent or remedy serious injury and to
facilitate adjustment, provided that such period of time

exceptional circumstances, if the competent investigating
authorities determine in conformity with the procedures set
out in Article 32, that the measure continues to be
necessary to prevent or remedy serious injury and to
facilitate adjustment and that there is evidence that the
domestic industry is adjusting, a bilateral safeguard
measure may be extended, provided that the total duration
of the bilateral safeguard measure, including such
extensions, shall not exceed three years. 



2. In order to facilitate adjustment in a situation where
the expected duration of a bilateral safeguard measure is
over one year, the Party applying the bilateral safeguard

competent investigating authorities of the Party which
carry out the investigation shall evaluate all relevant
factors of an objective and quantifiable nature having a
bearing on the situation of that domestic industry, in

2. With a view to ensuring that any measure adopted or
maintained by a Party in any services sector relating to
the qualification requirements and procedures, technical
standards and licensing requirements of service suppliers

such measure: 



(a) is based on objective and transparent criteria,
such as the competence and ability to supply the
service; 



(b) is not more burdensome than necessary to ensure
the quality of the service; and 



(c) in the case of licensing procedures, is not in
itself a restriction on the supply of the
service. 


3. Paragraph 2 is binding upon a Party only in sectors in

recognize the education or experience obtained,
requirements met, or licenses or certifications granted in
a particular country. Such recognition, which may be
achieved through harmonization or otherwise, may be based
upon an agreement or arrangement with the country concerned
or may be accorded autonomously. 



2. Where a Party recognizes, autonomously, or by an
agreement or arrangement, the education or experience
obtained, requirements met, or licenses or certifications
granted in a non-Party, nothing in Article 105 shall be
construed to require the Party to accord such recognition
to the education or experience obtained, requirements met,
or licenses or certifications granted in the other Party. 



3. A Party that is a party to an agreement or arrangement
referred to in paragraph 2, whether existing or future,
shall afford adequate opportunity for the other Party, if

comparable with it. Where a Party accords recognition
autonomously, it shall afford adequate opportunity for the
other Party to demonstrate that education or experience
obtained, requirements met, or licenses or certifications
granted in that other Party should be recognized. 



4. Neither Party shall accord recognition in a manner
that would constitute a means of discrimination between 
countries in the application of its standards or criteria

of participation and be capable of fulfilling the terms of
the contract.

decides not to issue the contract, the entity shall make
the award to the tenderer who has been determined to be

discrimination against the suppliers of the other Party or
protection to domestic producers or suppliers: 



(a) in the absence of tenders in response to the
tender pursuant to Articles 151 through 156, or
when the tenders submitted have been collusive in 
accordance with the laws and regulations of the
former Party, or not in conformity with the
essential requirements in the tender, or from
suppliers who do not comply with the conditions
for participation provided for in accordance with
this Chapter, on condition that the requirements
of the initial tender are not substantially
modified in the contract as awarded; 



(b) 	when, for works of art or for reasons connected
with protection of exclusive rights, such as
patents or copyrights, or in the absence of
competition for technical reasons, the goods or
services can be supplied only by a particular
supplier and no reasonable alternative or
substitute exists; 



(c) in so far as is strictly necessary when, for
reasons of extreme urgency brought about by
events unforeseeable by the procuring entity, the
goods or services could not be obtained in time
by means of the tendering procedures pursuant to
Articles 151 through 156; 



(d) for additional deliveries by the original
supplier of goods or services that were not
included in the initial procurement where a
change of supplier for such additional goods or
services: 


(i) 	cannot be made for economic or technical 
reasons such as requirements of
interchangeability or interoperability with
existing equipment, software, services, or
installations procured under the initial
procurement; or 


(ii) would cause significant inconvenience or
substantial duplication of costs for the
procuring entity; 


(e) when a procuring entity procures prototypes or a
first good or service which are developed at its
request in the course of, and for, a particular
contract for research, experiment, study or
original development. When such contracts have
been fulfilled, subsequent procurements of such
goods or services shall be subject to Articles
151 through 156; 


Note: 	Original development of a first good or
service may include limited production or
supply in order to incorporate the results
of field testing and to demonstrate that
the good or service is suitable for
production or supply in quantity to
acceptable quality standards. It does not
extend to quantity production or supply to
establish commercial viability or to
recover research and development costs. 


(f) for goods purchased on a commodity market; 



(g) for purchases made under exceptionally
advantageous conditions which only arise in the
very short term. This provision is intended to
cover unusual disposals by enterprises which are
not normally suppliers, or disposal of assets of
businesses in liquidation or receivership. It is
not intended to cover routine purchases from
regular suppliers; and 



(h) 	in the case of contracts awarded to the winner of 
a design contest provided that the contest has
been organized in a manner which is consistent
with the principles of this Chapter, notably as
regards the publication, in the sense of Article
152, of a notice of intended procurement to
suitably qualified suppliers, to participate in
such a contest which shall be judged by an
independent jury with a view to design contracts
being awarded to the winners.

for its procuring entities to resort to the tendering
procedures under paragraph 1, the entities maintain a
record or prepare a written report providing specific
justification for such procedures.</article>

provide information including, when the supplier is an
unsuccessful tenderer, pertinent information concerning the
reasons why its tender was not selected and on the
characteristics and relative advantages of the tender
selected as well as the name of the winning tenderer. 



3. Where a supplier of a Party is an unsuccessful
tenderer, the Party may seek, without prejudice to the
provisions under Chapter 15, such additional information on
the contract award as may be necessary to ensure that the
procurement was made fairly and impartially. The other
Party shall provide information on both the characteristics
and relative advantages of the wining tender and the
contract price. Normally, this latter information may be
disclosed by the former Party provided it exercises this
right with discretion. In cases where release of this
information would prejudice competition in future tenders,
this information shall be confidential and not be disclosed 
except after consultation with and agreement of the other
Party.</article>

government procurement, each Party shall encourage the

consideration to any such complaint, in a manner that is
not prejudicial to obtaining corrective measures under the
challenge system.

context of government procurements in which they have, or
have had, an interest.

6. Challenges shall be heard by an impartial and
independent reviewing authority with no interest in the
outcome of the government procurement and the members of
which are secure from external influence during the term of
appointment. A reviewing authority which is not a court

given or a decision is reached; 



(b) participants can be represented and accompanied; 



(c) participants shall have access to all
proceedings;

consequences for the interests concerned,
including the public interest, may be taken into
account in deciding whether such measures should
be applied; 



(b) an assessment and, where appropriate, a decision
on the justification of the challenge; and 



(c) where appropriate, correction of breaches of this
Chapter or compensation for the loss or damages
suffered, which may be limited to costs for

national defense purposes. 



2. Subject to the requirement that such measures are not
applied in a manner that would constitute a means of
arbitrary or unjustifiable discrimination between the

restriction on trade, nothing in this Chapter shall be
construed to prevent a Party from imposing, enforcing or
maintaining measures: 



(a) necessary to protect public morals, order or
safety;

an agreement between the Parties not being reached, the
Party which has received such notification may have
recourse to the dispute settlement procedure under Chapter

agreed period of time in order to implement the award.

time pursuant to paragraph 3 within 45 days after the date
of the issuance of the award, the complaining Party may
refer the matter to an arbitral tribunal, which shall
determine a reasonable period of time to implement the

implement the award should not exceed 15 months from the
date of issuance of the award. However, that time may be
shorter or longer, depending upon the particular
circumstances. 



5. If the Party complained against considers it
impracticable to comply with the award within the
implementation period as determined pursuant to paragraphs

Party complained against that it intends to suspend the
application to the Party complained against of concessions
or other obligations under this Agreement.

other obligations under paragraph 1 or 2 may only be
implemented at least 30 days after the date of the
notification in accordance with the applicable provisions
of this Article. Such suspension shall: 



(a) not be effected if, in respect of the dispute to
which the suspension relates, consultations or
proceedings before the arbitral tribunal are in
progress; 



(b) be temporary, and be discontinued when the
Parties reach a mutually satisfactory resolution
or where compliance with the award is effected; 



(c) 	be restricted to the same level of nullification 
or impairment that is attributable to the failure
to comply with the award; and 



(d) 	be restricted to the same sector or sectors to 
which the nullification or impairment relates,

suspend the application of concessions or
obligations in such sector or sectors. 


4. If the Party complained against considers that the
requirements for the suspension of the application to it of
concessions or other obligations under this Agreement by
the complaining Party set out in paragraph 1, 2 or 3 have
not been met, it may request consultations with the
complaining Party. The complaining Party shall enter into
consultations within 10 days after the date of receipt of
the request. If the Parties fail to resolve the matter
within 30 days after the date of receipt of the request for
consultations pursuant to this paragraph, the Party
complained against may refer the matter to an arbitral
tribunal, which then shall determine whether such
requirements have been met.

arbitral tribunal that is established for the purposes of
Article 218 and this Article shall, wherever possible,
have, as its arbitrators, the arbitrators of the original
arbitral tribunal. If this is not possible, the arbitrators
to the arbitral tribunal that is established for the 
purposes of Article 218 and this Article shall be appointed
pursuant to paragraph 1 of Article 210. Unless the Parties
agree on a different period, the arbitral tribunal
established under Article 218 and this Article shall issue 
its award within 60 days after the date when the matter is
referred to it. Such award shall be binding on the Parties.</article>
