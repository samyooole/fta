5. Where the regulatory authority determines that a relevant market is not effectively competitive, it shall identify and designate services suppliers with significant market power on that market and shall impose, maintain or amend specific regulatory obligations referred to in Article 234 of this Agreement, as appropriate. Where the regulatory authority concludes that the market is effectively competitive it shall not impose or maintain any of the regulatory obligations referred to in Article 234 of this Agreement. 


6. Each Party shall ensure that a services supplier affected by the decision of a regulatory authority shall have a right to appeal against that decision to an appeal body that is independent of the parties involved in the decision. Each Party 

shall ensure that the merits of the case are duly taken into account. Pending the outcome of any such appeal, the decision of the regulatory authority shall stand, unless the appeal body decides otherwise. Where the appeal body is not judicial in character, written reasons for its decision shall always be given and its decisions shall also be subject to review by an impartial and independent judicial authority. Decisions taken by appeal bodies shall be effectively enforced. 

7.

Each Party shall ensure that any services suppliers authorised to provide electronic communication services shall have the right and obligation to negotiate access and interconnection with suppliers of publicly available electronic communication networks and services. Access and interconnection should, in principle, be agreed on the basis of commercial negotiation between the services suppliers concerned. 


2. Each Party shall ensure that services suppliers that acquire information from another supplier during the process of negotiating interconnection arrangements use that information solely for the purpose for which it was supplied and respect at all times the confidentiality of information transmitted or stored. 


3. Each Party shall ensure that upon the finding in accordance with Article 232 of this Agreement that a relevant market is not effectively competitive, the regulatory authority shall have the power to impose on the supplier designated as having significant market power one or more of the following obligations in relation to interconnection and/or access: 

(a) 	obligation on non-discrimination to ensure that the operator applies equivalent conditions in equivalent circumstances to other suppliers providing equivalent services, and provides services and information to others under the same conditions and of the same quality as it provides for its own services or those of its subsidiaries or partners; 


(1) Licence fees do not include payments for auction, tendering or other non-discriminatory means of awarding concessions, or mandated contributions to universal service provision. 


(b) 	obligation of a vertically integrated company to make transparent its wholesale prices and its internal transfer prices, where there is a requirement for non-discrimination or for prevention of unfair cross-subsidy. The regulatory authority may specify the format and accounting methodology to be used; 


(c) obligations to meet reasonable requests for access to, and use of, specific network elements and associated facilities, including unbundled access to the local loop, inter alia, in situations where the regulatory authority considers that denial of access or unreasonable terms and conditions having a similar effect would hinder the emergence of a sustainable competitive market at the retail level or would not be in the end user's interest. 

Regulatory authorities may attach conditions covering fairness, reasonableness and timeliness to the obligations included under this point; 

(d) 	to provide specified services on a wholesale basis for resale by third parties; to grant open access to technical interfaces, protocols or other key technologies that are indispensable for the interoperability of services or virtual network services; to provide co-location or other forms of facility sharing, including duct, building or mast sharing; to provide specified services needed to ensure interoperability of end-to-end services to users, including facilities for intelligent network services; to provide access to operational support systems or similar software systems necessary to ensure fair competition in the provision of services; and to interconnect networks or network facilities. 

Regulatory authorities may attach conditions covering fairness, reasonableness and timeliness to the obligations included under this point; 

(e) 	obligations relating to cost recovery and price controls, including obligations for cost orientation of prices and obligations concerning cost accounting systems, for the provision of specific types of interconnection and/or access, in situations where a market analysis indicates that a lack of effective competition means that the operator concerned might sustain prices at an excessively high level, or apply a price squeeze, to the detriment of end-users. 

Regulatory authorities shall take into account the investment made by the operator and allow him a reasonable rate of return on adequate capital employed, taking into account the risks involved; 

(f) 	to publish the specific obligations imposed on services suppliers by the regulatory authority identifying the specific product/service and geographical markets. Up-to-date information, provided that it is not confidential and it does not comprise business secrets is made publicly available in a manner that guarantees all interested parties easy access to that information; 


(g) 	obligations for transparency requiring operators to make public specified information; in particular, where an operator has obligations of non-discrimination, the regulatory authority may require that operator to publish a reference offer, which shall be sufficiently unbundled to ensure that services suppliers are not required to pay for facilities which are not necessary for the service requested, giving a description of the relevant offerings broken down into components according to market needs, and the associated terms and conditions, including prices. 
4. Each Party shall ensure that a service supplier requesting interconnection with a supplier designated as having significant market power shall have recourse, either at any time or after a reasonable period of time which has been made publicly known, to an independent domestic body, which may be a regulatory body as referred to in Article 231(2)(d) of this Agreement to resolve disputes regarding terms and conditions for interconnection and/or access.</article>
      <article number="ARTICLE 235" name="Scarce Resources" article_identifier="37602">1. Each Party shall ensure that any procedures for the allocation and use of scarce resources, including frequencies, numbers and rights of way, shall be carried out in an objective, proportionate, timely, transparent and non-discriminatory manner. The current state of allocated frequency bands shall be made publicly available, but detailed identification of frequencies allocated for specific government uses is not required. 


2. Each Party shall ensure the effective management of radio frequencies for electronic communication services in their territory with a view to ensuring effective and efficient use of the spectrum. Where demand for specific frequencies exceeds their availability, appropriate and transparent procedures shall be followed for the assignment of those frequencies in order to optimise their use and facilitate the development of competition. 


3. Each Party shall ensure that the assignment of national numbering resources and the management of the national numbering plans are entrusted to the regulatory authority. 


4. Where public or local authorities retain ownership or control of suppliers operating public communication networks and/or services, effective structural separation needs to be ensured between the function responsible for granting the rights of way from activities associated with ownership or control.</article>
      <article number="ARTICLE 236" name="Universal Service" article_identifier="37603">1. Each Party has the right to define the kind of universal service obligations it wishes to maintain. 


2. Such obligations will not be regarded as anti-competitive per se, provided they are administered in a transparent, objective and non-discriminatory way. The administration of such obligations shall also be neutral with respect to competition and shall not be more burdensome than necessary for the kind of universal service defined by the Party. 


3. Each Party shall ensure that all suppliers are eligible to ensure universal service and no services supplier is excluded a priori. The designation shall be made through an efficient, transparent, objective and non-discriminatory mechanism. Where necessary, each Party shall assess whether the provision of universal service represents an unfair burden on organisation(s) designated to provide universal service. Where justified on the basis of such calculation, and taking into account the market benefit, if any, which accrues to an organisation that offers universal service, regulatory authorities shall determine whether a mechanism is required to compensate the services supplier(s) concerned or to share the net cost of universal service obligations. 


4. Each Party shall ensure that: 

(a) 	directories of all subscribers are available to users, whether printed or electronic, or both, and are updated on a regular basis, and at least once a year; and

This Chapter applies to any contracting authority and any contracting entity which meets the definitions of the Union acquis on public procurement (hereinafter referred to as the ‘contracting entities’). It also covers bodies governed by public law and public undertakings in the field of utilities, such as state-owned enterprises carrying out the relevant activities, and private undertakings operating on the basis of special and exclusive rights in the field of utilities. 


3. This Chapter applies to contracts above value thresholds set out in Annex XXIX-A to this Agreement. 


4. The calculation of the estimated value of a public contract shall be based on the total amount payable, net of taxes on value added. When applying those thresholds, the Republic of Moldova will calculate and convert contract values into its national currency, using the conversion rate of its National Bank. 


5. Value thresholds shall be revised regularly every two years, beginning in the year of entry into force of this Agreement, based on the average daily value of the euro, expressed in Special Drawing Rights, over the 24 month period terminating on the last day of August preceding the revision, with effect from January 1.

2. In the framework of institutional reform, the Republic of Moldova shall designate in particular: 

(a) 	an executive body responsible for economic policy at central government level tasked with guaranteeing a coherent policy in all areas related to public procurement. Such a body shall facilitate and coordinate the implementation of this Chapter and guide the process of gradual approximation to the Union acquis; and 


(b) an impartial and independent body tasked with the review of decisions taken by contracting authorities or entities during the award of contracts. In that context, ‘independent’ means that that body shall be a public authority which is separate from all contracting entities and economic operators. There shall be a possibility to subject the decisions taken by that body to judicial review. 
3. Each Party shall ensure that decisions taken by the authorities responsible for the review of complaints by economic operators concerning infringements of domestic law shall be effectively enforced.</article>
      <article number="ARTICLE 271" name="Basic Standards Regulating The Award Of Contracts" article_identifier="37638">1. No later than nine months from the entry into force of this Agreement, the Parties shall comply with a set of basic standards for the award of all contracts as stipulated in paragraphs 2 to 15. Those basic standards derive directly from the rules and principles of public procurement, as regulated in the Union acquis on public procurement, including the principles of non-discrimination, equal treatment, transparency and proportionality. 

Publication 

2. Each Party shall ensure that all intended procurements are published in an appropriate medium in a manner that is sufficient to: 

(a) 	enable the market to be opened up to competition; and 


(b) 	allow any interested economic operator to have appropriate access to information regarding the intended procurement prior to the award of the contract and to express its interest in obtaining the contract. 

3. The publication shall be appropriate to the economic interest of the contract to economic operators. 


4. The publication shall contain at least the essential details of the contract to be awarded, the criteria for qualitative selection, the award method, the contract award criteria and any other additional information that the economic operators reasonably need to decide on whether to express their interest in obtaining the contract. 

Award of contracts 

5. All contracts shall be awarded through transparent and impartial award procedures that prevent corrupt practices. That impartiality shall be ensured in particular through the non-discriminatory description of the subject matter of the contract, equal access for all economic operators, appropriate time-limits and a transparent and objective approach. 


6. When describing the characteristics of the required work, supply or service, the contracting entities shall use general descriptions of performance and functions and international, European or national standards. 


7. The description of the characteristics required of a work, supply or service shall not refer to a specific make or source, or a particular process, or to trademarks, patents, types or a specific origin or production unless such a reference is justified by the subject matter of the contract and accompanied by the words ‘or equivalent’. Preference shall be given to the use of general descriptions of performance or functions. 


8. Contracting entities shall not impose conditions resulting in direct or indirect discrimination against the economic operators of the other Party, such as the requirement that economic operators interested in the contract are required to be established in the same country, region or territory as the contracting entity. 

Notwithstanding the first subparagraph, in cases where it is justified by the specific circumstances of the contract, the successful applicant may be required to establish certain business infrastructure at the place of performance. 

9. The time-limits for expression of interest and for submission of offers shall be sufficiently long to allow economic operators from the other Party to make a meaningful assessment of the tender and prepare their offer. 


10. All participants are required to know the applicable rules, selection criteria and award criteria in advance. Those rules must apply equally to all participants. 


11. Contracting entities may invite a limited number of applicants to submit an offer, provided that: 

(a) it is done in a transparent and non-discriminatory manner; and 


(b) the selection is based only on objective factors such as the experience of the applicants in the sector concerned, the size and infrastructure of their businesses or their technical and professional abilities. 
In inviting a limited number of applicants to submit an offer, account shall be taken of the need to ensure adequate competition. 


12. Contracting entities may use negotiated procedures only in exceptional and defined cases when the use of such a procedure effectively does not distort competition. 


13. Contracting entities may use qualification systems only under the condition that the list of qualified operators is compiled by means of a sufficiently advertised, transparent and open procedure. Contracts falling within the scope of such a system shall be awarded also on a non-discriminatory basis. 


14. Each Party shall ensure that contracts are awarded in a transparent manner to the applicant who has submitted the economically most advantageous offer or the offer with the lowest price, based on the tender criteria and the procedural rules established and communicated in advance. The final decisions shall be communicated to all applicants without undue delay. Upon request of an unsuccessful applicant, reasons must be provided in sufficient detail to allow the review of such a decision. 

Judicial protection 

15. Each Party shall ensure that any person having or having had an interest in obtaining a particular contract and who has been, or risks being, harmed by an alleged infringement is entitled to effective, impartial judicial protection against any decision of the contracting entity related to the award of that contract. The decisions taken in the course and at the end of such review procedure shall be made public in a manner that is sufficient to inform all interested economic operators.</article>

In that process, due account shall be taken of the corresponding case law of the Court of Justice of the European Union and the implementing measures adopted by the European Commission, as well as, should it become necessary, of any modifications of the Union acquis occurring in the meantime. The implementation of each phase shall be evaluated by the Association Committee in Trade configuration, as set out in Article 438(4) of this Agreement, and, following a positive assessment by that Committee, it shall be linked to the reciprocal granting of market access as set out in Annex XXIX-B to this Agreement.

It shall provide appropriate advice and technical assistance for the purpose of implementing such modifications.

2. The decision to proceed to a further phase of market opening shall be made on the basis of an assessment of the quality of the legislation adopted as well as its practical implementation. Such assessment shall be carried out regularly by the Association Committee in Trade configuration, as set out in Article 438(4) of this Agreement. 


3. In so far as a Party has, according to Annex XXIX-B to this Agreement, opened its procurement market to the other Party: 

(a) 	the Union shall grant access to contract award procedures to companies of the Republic of Moldova, whether established or not in the Union, pursuant to Union public procurement rules under treatment no less favourable than that accorded to Union companies; 


(b) the Republic of Moldova shall grant access to contract award procedures for Union companies, whether established or not in the Republic of Moldova, pursuant to national procurement rules under treatment no less favourable than that accorded to companies of the Republic of Moldova. 

4. After the implementation of the last phase in the process of approximation, the Parties will examine the possibility to grant mutual market access with regard to procurements below the value thresholds set out in Annex XXIX-A to this Agreement.

placement under a suspensive procedure or placement under a free zone or a free warehouse of goods infringing an intellectual property right (1) may take place, to lodge an application in writing with the competent authorities, whether administrative or judicial, for the suspension by the customs authorities of the release or detention of such goods. 

2. Each Party shall provide that when the customs authorities, in the course of their actions and before an application has been lodged by a right holder or granted, have sufficient grounds for suspecting that goods infringe an intellectual property right, they may suspend the release of the goods or detain them in order to enable the right holder to submit an application for action in accordance with paragraph 1.
