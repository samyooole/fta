ARTICLE 84 
Investment 
 
1.  Upon the conclusion of the investment agreement between ASEAN and 
China pursuant to Article 5 of the Framework Agreement on Comprehensive 
Economic Co-operation between ASEAN and the People’s Republic of China 
(the “ASEAN-China Investment Agreement”), the provisions of that agreement 
shall, mutatis mutandis, be incorporated into and form an integral part of this 
Agreement unless the context otherwise requires. 
 
2.  Recognising  that  negotiations  on  the  ASEAN-China  Investment 
Agreement are ongoing, the Parties agree to co-operate to facilitate the early 
conclusion of that agreement. 
 
3.  For  greater  certainty,  any  rights,  obligations,  restrictions  or  exceptions 
contained in the ASEAN-China Investment Agreement that do not relate to either 
Party shall accordingly be inapplicable under this Agreement.  Notwithstanding 
Article 112 (Relation to Other Agreements), in the event of any inconsistency 
between  the  ASEAN-China  Investment  Agreement  and  this  Agreement,  the 
provisions of this Agreement shall prevail. 
 
4.  At any time after the entry into force of this Agreement, upon request by 
either  Party,  the  Parties  shall  consult  with  a  view  to  further  encouraging  or 
facilitating the flow of investments between the Parties.
