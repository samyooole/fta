ANNEX 2 
PRODUCT SPECIFIC RULES 
 
Preamble 
 
For the purpose of Article 15 (Product Specific Rules) of the CSFTA, products which 
satisfy the Product Specific Rules set out herein shall be considered as goods which 
have undergone sufficient transformation, and hence shall be treated as the 
originating products of a Party in whose territory such transformation took place. 
 
A country of origin of a product shall be a Party in whose territory the last sufficient 
transformation of that product was performed. As for a product whose production 
took place in the territories of both Parties, originating status shall be conferred on a 
Party in whose territory the last sufficient transformation took place. 
 
 
A.

The following product specific criteria shall be the sole criteria for determining the 
originating status of the following products. When applying for a Certificate of Origin
