ARTICLE 107 
Restrictions to Safeguard the Balance-of-Payments 
 
1. 
In the event of serious balance-of-payments and external financial 
difficulties or threat thereof, a Party may: 
 
(a) 
in the case of trade in goods, adopt restrictive import measures in 
accordance with the GATT 1994 and the Understanding on the 
Balance-of-Payments Provisions of the GATT 1994; 
 
(b) 
in the case of trade in services, adopt or maintain restrictions on 
which it has undertaken specific commitments, including on 
payments or transfers for transactions related to such commitments.  
It is recognised that particular pressures on the balance-of-
payments of a Party in the process of economic development or 
economic transition may necessitate the use of restrictions to 
ensure, inter alia, the maintenance of a level of financial reserves 
adequate for the implementation of its programme of economic 
development or economic transition. 
 
2. 
The restrictions referred to in paragraph 1: 
 
 
(a) 
shall be consistent with the Articles of Agreement of the 
International Monetary Fund; 
 
 
(b) 
shall avoid unnecessary damage to the commercial, economic and 
financial interests of the other Party; 
 
 
(c) 
shall not exceed those necessary to deal with the circumstances 
described in paragraph 1; 
 
 
(d) 
shall be temporary and be phased out progressively as the situation 
specified in paragraph 1 improves. 
 
3. 
In determining the incidence of such restrictions, the Parties may give 
priority to economic sectors which are more essential to their economic or 
development programmes.  However, such restrictions shall not be adopted or 
maintained for the purpose of protecting a particular sector. 
 
4. 
Any restrictions adopted or maintained under paragraph 1, or any changes 
therein, shall be promptly notified to the other Party.
