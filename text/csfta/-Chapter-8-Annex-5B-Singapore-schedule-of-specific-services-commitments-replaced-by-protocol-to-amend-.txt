Annex 5B - 1 ANNEX 5 Part B – Singapore’s Schedule of Specific Commitments on Services   Notes: (a) The classification of service sectors in this revised offer is based on the 1991 provisional Central Product Classification (CPC) of the United Nations Statistical Office unless otherwise indicated by the absence of a CPC number.  The ordering reflects the services sectoral classifications list as used in the GATT document MTN.GNS/W/120 dated 10 July 1991. (b) The use of “**” against individual CPC codes indicates that the specific commitment for that code shall not extend to the total range of services covered under that code.  The entry “Unbound*” means unbound due to lack of technical feasibility.
