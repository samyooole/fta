ARTICLE 21.3 : TAXATION  1.   Except as set out in this Article, nothing in this Agreement shall apply to taxation measures.    2.   Nothing in this Agreement shall affect the rights and obligations of either Party under any tax convention.

In the case of a tax convention between the Parties, the competent authorities under that convention shall have sole  responsibility for determining whether any inconsistency exists between this Agreement and that convention.  21-1  This is without prejudice to the classification of digital products as a good or a service.  21-2  If GATS Article XIV is amended, this Article shall be amended, as appropriate, after consultations between the Parties.      3.      Notwithstanding paragraph 2:      238         4.   (a)  Article 2.1 (National Treatment) and such other provisions of this Agreement as are necessary to give effect to that Article shall apply to taxation measures to the same extent as does GATT 1994 Article III; and    (b)   Article 2.4 (Export Tax) shall apply to taxation measures.   Subject to paragraph 2:   (a)  Article 8.3 (National Treatment) and Article 10.2 (National Treatment) shall apply to taxation measures on income, capital gains or on the taxable capital of corporations that relate to the purchase or consumption of particular services, except that nothing in this subparagraph shall prevent a Party from conditioning the receipt or continued receipt of an advantage relating to the purchase or consumption of particular services on requirements to provide the service in its territory, and    (b)  Article 15.4 (National and Most-Favored-Nation Treatment), Articles 8.4 (National Treatment) and 8.4 (Most-Favored-Nation Treatment) and Articles 10.2 (National Treatment) and 10.3 (Most-Favored-Nation Treatment) shall apply to all taxation measures, other than those on income, capital gains, or on the taxable capital of corporations, taxes on estates, inheritances, gifts and generation- skipping transfers,    except that nothing in those Articles shall apply:    (c)  to any most-favored-nation obligation with respect to an advantage accorded by a Party pursuant to a tax convention;    (d)   to a non-conforming provision of any existing taxation measure;    (e)   to the continuation or prompt renewal of a non-conforming provision of any existing taxation measure;   (f)   to an amendment to a non-conforming provision of any existing taxation measure to the extent that the amendment does not decrease its conformity, at the time of the amendment, with any of those Articles;   (g)   to the adoption or enforcement of any taxation measure aimed at ensuring the equitable or effective imposition or collection of taxes (as permitted by GATS Article XIV(d)); or   (h)   to a provision that conditions the receipt, or continued receipt of an advantage relating to the contributions to, or income of, a pension trust, fund, or other arrangement to provide pension or similar benefits on a requirement that the Party maintain continuous jurisdiction over such trust, fund, or other arrangement.      5.

Article 15.15 (Submission of a Claim to Arbitration) shall apply to a taxation measure alleged to be a breach of an investment agreement or an investment authorization.  Articles 15.6 (Expropriation) and 15.15 shall apply to a taxation measure alleged to be an expropriation.   However, no investor may invoke Article 15.6 as the basis for a claim where it has been determined pursuant to this paragraph that the measure is not an expropriation.  An investor that seeks to invoke Article 15.6 with respect to a taxation measure must first refer to the competent authorities described in paragraph 7, at the time that it gives notice under Article 15.15.2, the issue of whether that taxation measure involves an expropriation.  If the competent authorities do not agree to consider the issue or, having agreed to consider it, fail to agree that the measure is not an expropriation within a period of six months of such referral, the investor may submit its claim to arbitration under Article 15.15.4.  7.   For purposes of this Article,    (a)  competent authorities means   (i)  in the case of Singapore, Director (Taxation), Ministry of Finance; and   (ii)  in the case of the United States, the Assistant Secretary of the Treasury (Tax Policy), Department of the Treasury; and   (b)  investment agreement and investment authorization have the meanings ascribed to them in Chapter 15 (Investment).   ARTICLE 21.4 : DISCLOSURE OF INFORMATION  Nothing in this Agreeme nt shall be construed to require a Party to furnish or allow access to confidential information, the disclosure of which would impede law enforcement, or otherwise be contrary to the public interest, or which would prejudice the legitimate commercial interests of particular enterprises, public or private.
