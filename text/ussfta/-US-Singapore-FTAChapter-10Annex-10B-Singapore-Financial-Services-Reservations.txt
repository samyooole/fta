 10B-Singapore-1 1  ANNEX 10B SCHEDULE OF SINGAPORE   SECTION A - HEADNOTES   1. Commitments under the Chapter on Financial Services are undertaken subject to the limitations and conditions set forth in these headnotes and the schedule below.    2. To clarify Singapore's commitment with respect to Article 10.4(b) of the Agreement (Market Access for Financial Institutions), juridical persons supplying financial services are subject to non-discriminatory limitations on juridical form.1  3. (a) Solely in the context of future liberalization of its banking sub-sector and not for purposes of affording protection to local financial institutions within the banking sub-sector, Singapore may impose new non-conforming measures on a most-favored-nation treatment basis.  Such measures may include, but are not limited to:  (i) requirements regarding the composition of boards of directors of banks and finance companies; and  (ii) limitations on the number of customer service locations of finance companies,  provided that any such non-conforming measure shall not derogate from commitments undertaken by Singapore in its Schedule to Annexes 10B and 10C to liberalize quantitative restrictions on the number of licenses or customer service locations for United States banks or establish time periods for allowing United States banks access to any ATM network in Singapore.    (b)  Where a United States financial institution chooses not to participate in a future liberalization described in subparagraph (a), Singapore shall not apply any related new non-conforming measure or take any adverse action with respect to the institution.  (c) If Singapore imposes any new non-conforming measure described in paragraph (a), it will:  (i) notify the United States of its intent at least three months in advance of implementation of the measure;  (ii) consult with the United States concerning the measure and give due consideration to the views expressed by the United States in this respect; and                                     1 For example, partnerships and sole proprietorships are generally not acceptable juridical forms for depository financial institutions in Singapore.  This headnote is not itself intended to affect, or otherwise limit, a choice by a financial institution of the other Party between branches or subsidiaries.     10B-Singapore-2 2 (iii) make compensatory adjustments to its Schedule to Annex 10B  with respect to the same class of financial institutions of the banking sub-sector as are affected by the measure such that the general level of commitments is more favorable to trade in the banking sub-sector than prior to the new measure. 2  (d)  In connection with the liberalization of the 20% aggregate foreign shareholding limit in finance companies effected on 11 December 2002, Singapore reserves the right to introduce a 12% approval threshold for acquisition of shareholdings or voting control in finance companies.  Subparagraph (c) shall not apply to this measure.  4.  (a) Singapore reserves the right to require a foreign bank that is systemically important to incorporate within Singapore, provided that such a requirement is applied in a reasonable, objective,  and impartial manner.  Before imposing such a requirement, Singapore will take into account such factors as the quality of home country regulation and supervision over the bank, degree of protection accorded to depositors in the home country vis-à-vis depositors in Singapore, and the amount of assets held or situated in Singapore.   (b) Singapore shall not impose the requirement described in subparagraph (a) with respect to a foreign bank of the United States, unless it:    (i) notifies the bank and the United States of its intent at least six months before imposing the requirement;   (ii) consults with the United States concerning the requirement and gives due consideration to the views expressed by the United States in this respect; and   (iii) allows the bank a reasonable time to comply with the requirement.                                       2 It is understood that compensatory adjustments shall not be regarded as inadequate solely because the general level of commitments after the introduction of the new measure is not significantly more favorable to trade in the banking sub-sector than prior to the introduction of the measure.  10B-Singapore-3 3SCHEDULE OF SINGAPORE TO ANNEX 10B SECTION B   BANKING  Type of Reservation: Market Access for Financial Institutions and National Treatment  Level of Government:  National   Measures: Banking Act, Cap. 19 MAS Notice 619  Description: No new full bank licenses will be granted to foreign banks.
