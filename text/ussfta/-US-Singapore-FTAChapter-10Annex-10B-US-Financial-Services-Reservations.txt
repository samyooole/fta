 10B-United States-1   ANNEX 10B PART I:  UNITED STATES SCHEDULE OF NON-CONFORMING MEASURES WITH RESPECT TO BANKING AND OTHER FINANCIAL SERVICES (EXCLUDING INSURANCE) A.  Headnotes  1. Commitments in these subsectors under the Agreement are undertaken subject to the limitations and conditions set forth in these headnotes and in Section B below. 2. National treatment commitments in these subsectors are subject to the following limitations: National treatment will be provided based upon the foreign bank’s “home state” in the United States, as that term is defined under the International Banking Act, where that Act is applicable.  A domestic bank subsidiary of a foreign firm will have its own “home state,” and national treatment will be provided based upon the subsidiary’s home state, as determined under applicable law.1 3. To clarify the U.S. commitment with respect to Article 10.4 of the Agreement (Market Access), juridical persons supplying banking or other financial services (excluding insurance) and constituted under the laws of the United States are subject to non-discriminatory limitations on juridical form.2 4. The United States undertakes no commitment with respect to any existing non-conforming measures maintained at a regional level. 5. The United States limits its commitment under Article 10.9.1(c) (Non-Conforming Measures) with respect to Article 10.4 (Market Access) in the following manner: Article 10.9.1(c) shall apply only to non-conforming measures relating to 10.4(a) and not to those non-conforming measures relating to Article 10.4(b).                                                               1 Foreign banking organizations are generally subject to geographic and other limitations in the United States on a national treatment basis.  Where such limitations do not conform to national treatment, they have been reserved as market access restrictions.  For purposes of illustration, under this approach, the following situation does not accord national treatment and would therefore be scheduled as a limitation: a foreign bank from a particular home state is accorded less favorable treatment than that accorded to a domestic bank from that state with respect to expansion by branching.  2 For example, partnerships and sole proprietorships are generally not acceptable juridical forms for depository financial institutions in the United States.  This headnote is not itself intended to affect, or otherwise limit, a choice by a financial institution of the other Party between branches or subsidiaries.  10B-United States-2    B.
