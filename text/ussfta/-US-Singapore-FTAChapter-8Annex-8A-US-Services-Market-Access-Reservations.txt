8A-United States-1 ANNEX 8A   SCHEDULE OF THE UNITED STATES   Sector:  Atomic Energy    Obligations Concerned:   National Treatment (Articles 8.3 and 15.4)      Level of Government:  Central    Measures:  Atomic Energy Act of 1954, 42 U.S.C. §§ 2011 et seq.     Description:  Investment  A license issued by the United States Nuclear Regulatory Commission is required for any person in the United States to transfer or receive in interstate commerce, manufacture, produce, transfer, use, import or export any nuclear “utilization or production facilities” for commercial or industrial purposes.  Such a license may not be issued to any entity known or believed to be owned, controlled or dominated by an alien, a foreign corporation or a foreign government (42 U.S.C. §§ 2133(d)).  A license issued by the United States Nuclear Regulatory Commission is also required for nuclear "utilization and production facilities" for use  in medical therapy or for research and development activities. The issuance of such a license to any entity known or believed to be owned, controlled or dominated by an alien, a foreign corporation or a foreign government is also prohibited (42 U.S.C. § 2134(d)).    8A-United States-2 Sector:  Business Services    Obligations Concerned:  National Treatment (Articles 8.3 and 15.4) Local Presence (Article 8.6)     Level of Government:  Central    Measures:  Export Trading Company Act of 1982, 15 U.S.C. §§ 4011-4021  15 C.F.R. Part 325    Description:  Cross-Border Services  Title III of the Export Trading Company Act of 1982 authorizes the Secretary of Commerce to issue "certificates of review" with respect to export conduct.  The Act provides for the issuance of a certificate of review where the Secretary determines, and the Attorney General concurs, that the export conduct specified in an application will not have the anticompetitive effects proscribed by the Act.  A certificate of review limits the liability under federal and state antitrust laws in engaging in the export conduct certified.  Only a "person" as defined by the Act can apply for a certificate of review.  "Person" means "an individual who is a resident of the United States; a partnership that is created under and exists pursuant to the laws of any State or of the United States; a State or local government entity; a corporation, whether organized as a profit or nonprofit corporation, that is created under and exists pursuant to the laws of any State or of the United States; or any association or combination, by contract or other arrangement, between such persons."    A foreign national or enterprise may receive the protection provided by a certificate of review by becoming a "member" of a qualified applicant.  The regulations define "member" to mean "an entity (U.S. or foreign) that is seeking protection under the certificate with the applicant.  A member may be a partner in a partnership or a joint venture; a shareholder of a corporation; or a participant in an association, cooperative, or other form of profit or nonprofit organization or relationship, by contract or other arrangement."  8A-United States-3       Sector:  Business Services     Obligations Concerned:   National Treatment (Articles 8.3 and 15.4) Local Presence (Article 8.6)     Level of Government:  Central    Measures:  Export Administration Act of 1979, as amended, 50 U.S.C. app. 2401-2420.    International Emergency Economic Powers Act, 50 U.S.C. 1701-1706.  Export Administration Regulations, 15 C.F.R. Parts 730 through  774.      Description:  Cross-Border Services  With some limited exceptions, exports and reexports of commodities, software and technology subject to the Export Administration Regulations require a license from the Bureau of Industry and Security, U.S. Department of Commerce (BIS).  Certain activities of U.S. persons, wherever located, also require a license from BIS.  An application for a license must be made by a person in the United States.  In addition, release of controlled technology to a foreign national in the United States is deemed to be an export to the home country of the foreign national and requires the same written authorization from BIS as an export from the territory of the United States.    8A-United States-4 Sector:  Mining    Obligations Concerned:  National Treatment (Articles 8.3 and 15.4) Most-Favored-Nation Treatment (Articles 8.4 and 15.4)    Level of Government:  Central    Measures:  Mineral Lands Leasing Act of 1920, 30 U.S.C. Chapter 3A   10 U.S.C. § 7435      Description:  Investment  Under the Mineral Lands Leasing Act of 1920, aliens and foreign corporations may not acquire rights-of-way for oil or gas pipelines, or pipelines carrying products refined from oil and gas, across on-shore federal lands or acquire leases or interests in certain minerals on on-shore federal lands, such as coal or oil.  Non-U.S. citizens may own a 100 percent interest in a domestic corporation that acquires a right-of-way for oil or gas pipelines across on-shore federal lands, or that acquires a lease to develop mineral resources on on-shore federal lands, unless the foreign investor's home country denies similar or like privileges for the mineral or access in question to U.S. citizens or corporations, as compared with the privileges it accords to its own citizens or corporations or to the citizens or corporations of other countries (30 U.S.C. §§ 181, 185(a)).   Nationalization is not considered to be denial of similar or like privileges.    Foreign citizens, or corporations controlled by them, are restricted from obtaining access to federal leases on Naval Petroleum Reserves if the laws, customs or regulations of their country deny the privilege of leasing public lands to citizens or corporations of the United States (10 U.S.C. § 7435).    8A-United States-5 Sector:  All Sectors    Obligations Concerned:  National Treatment (Articles 8.3 and 15.4) Most-Favored-Nation Treatment (Articles 8.4 and 15.4)     Level of Government:   Central    Measures:  22 U.S.C. §§ 2194 and 2198(c)     Description:  Investment  The Overseas Private Investment Corporation insurance and loan guarantees are not available to certain aliens, foreign enterprises or foreign-controlled domestic enterprises.    8A-United States-6 Sector:  Air Transportation    Obligations Concerned:  National Treatment (Articles 8.3 and 15.4) Most-Favored-Nation Treatment (Articles 8.4 and 15.4) Senior Management and Boards of Directors (Article 15.9)    Level of Government:  Central    Measures:  49 U.S.C. Subtitle VII, Aviation Programs 14 C.F. R. Part  297 (foreign air freight forwarders); 14 C.F.R. Part 380, Subpart E (registration of foreign (passenger) charter operators   Description:  Investment   Only air carriers that are "citizens of the United States" may operate aircraft in domestic air service (cabotage) and may provide international scheduled and non-scheduled air service as U.S. air carriers.  U.S. citizens also have blanket authority to engage in indirect air transportation activities (air freight forwarding and passenger charter activities other than as actual operators of the aircraft).  In order to conduct such activities, non-U.S. citizens must obtain authority from the Department of Transportation.  Applications for such authority may be rejected for reasons relating to the failure of effective reciprocity, or if the Department of Transportation finds that it is in the public interest to do so.    Under 49 U.S.C. § 40102(15), a "citizen of the United States" means:    (a) an individual who is a U.S. citizen;   (b) a partnership in which each  member is a U.S. citizen; or   (c) a U.S. corporation of which the president and at least two-thirds of the board of directors and other managing officers are U.S. citizens, and at least 75 percent of the voting interest in the corporation is owned or controlled by U.S. citizens.  In addition, this statutory requirement has historically been interpreted by the Department of Transportation (and the Civil 8A-United States-7 Aeronautics Board before it) to require that an air carrier in fact be under the actual control of U.S. citizens.  The Department of Transportation makes this determination on a case-by-case basis, and has provided guidance as to certain lines of demarcation.  For example, total foreign equity investment of up to 49 percent (with a maximum of 25 percent being voting stock), by itself, is not construed as indicative of foreign control.  See Department of Transportation Order 91-1-41, January 23, 1991.    8A-United States-8 Sector:  Air Transportation    Obligations Concerned:  National Treatment (Articles 8.3 and 15.4) Most-Favored-Nation Treatment (Articles 8.4 and 15.4) Local Presence (Article 8.6) Senior Management and Boards of Directors (Article 5.9)    Level of Government:  Central    Measures:  49 U.S.C., Subtitle VII, Aviation Programs 49 U.S.C. § 41703  14 C.F.R.

Authorization from the Department of Transportation is required for the provision of specialty air services in the territory of the United States.*   Investment  2. "Foreign civil aircraft" require authority from the Department of Transportation to conduct specialty air services in the territory of the United States.  "Foreign civil aircraft" are aircraft of foreign registry or aircraft of U.S. registry that are owned, controlled or operated by persons who are not citizens or permanent residents of the United States (14 C.F.R. § 375.1).  Under 49 U.S.C. § 40102(15), a "citizen of the United States" means:    (a) an individual who is a U.S. citizen;  (b) a partnership in which each member is a U.S. citizen; or  (c) a U.S. corporation of which the president and at least two-thirds of the board of directors and other managing officers are U.S. citizens, and at least seventy-five percent of the voting interest in the corporation is owned or controlled by U.S. citizens.  8A-United States-9 In addition, this statutory requirement has historically been interpreted by the Department of Transportation (and the Civil Aeronautics Board before it) to require that an air carrier in fact be under the actual control of U.S. citizens.

See Department of Transportation Order 91-1-41, January 23, 1991.  * A person of Singapore will be able to to obtain such an authorization given Singapore’s acceptance of the definition of specialty air in the Cross-Border Services Chapter.    8A-United States-10 Sector:  Transportation Services - Customs Brokers    Obligations Concerned:  National Treatment (Articles 8.3 and 15.4) Local Presence (Article 8.6)    Level of Government:  Central    Measures:  19 U.S.C. § 1641(b)    Description:  Cross-Border Services and Investment  A customs broker's license is required to conduct customs business on behalf of another person.
