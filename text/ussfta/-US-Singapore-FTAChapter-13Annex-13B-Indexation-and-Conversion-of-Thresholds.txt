INDEXATION AND CONVERSION OF THRESHOLDS 
   
1.   The calculations referenced in Annex 13A of this Agreement shall be adjusted in 
accordance with the following formula:  
 
T (1 + รฐ) = T 
0 i 1
 
in which:  
 
T = threshold value on January 1, 2002  
0
รฐ = accumulated inflation rate for the ith two-year period  
i
 
T = new threshold value  
1
 
and the accumulated inflation rate (รฐ) is measured by:  
i
 
for the United States, the producer price index for finished products published by the U.S. 
Bureau of Labor Statistics; and  
 
for Singapore, the consumer price index published by the Singapore Department of 
Statistics.  
   
2.   The first adjustment for inflation, to take effect on January 1, 2004, shall be calculated 
using the period from November 1, 2001 to October 31, 2003.  All subsequent adjustments shall 
be calculated using two-year periods, each period beginning November 1.  The adjustments shall 
take effect on January 1 of the year immediately following the end of the two-year period.
