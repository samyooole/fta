 
ANNEX  3A 
PRODUCT-SPECIFIC RULES OF ORIGIN 
 
Notes: 
 
1.  The specific rule, or specific set of rules, that applies to a particular heading (4-digit 
code), subheading (6-digit code) or split subheading (ex. 6-digit code) is set out 
immediately adjacent to the heading, subheading or split subheading. 
 
2.  Unless otherwise specified in the Annex, a rule applicable to a split subheading shall 
take precedence over a rule applicable to the subheading which is parent to that split 
subheading.  In turn, a rule applicable to the subheading shall take precedence over a 
rule applicable to the heading which is parent to the subheading. 
 
3.  Reference to weight in the rules for goods provided for in Chapter 1 through 24 of the 
Harmonized System means dry weight unless otherwise specified in the Harmonized 
System. 
 
4.  A requirement of a change in tariff classification applies only to non-originating 
materials. The following are exceptions to change in tariff classification rules: 
 
    (i) agricultural and horticultural goods grown in the territory of a Party shall be 
treated as originating in the territory of that Party even if they are grown from 
seed, bulbs, rootstock, cuttings, slips or other live parts of plants imported from a 
non-Party; and 
     
    (ii) goods listed below which are exported from the territory of a Party, shall be 
treated as non-originating: 
   
  (a) heading 1202, if the goods were not harvested in the territory of a Party, 
   
  (b) subheading 2008.11, if any material provided for in heading 1202 used in the 
production of such goods was not harvested in the territory of a Party, or 
 
  (c) subheading 1806.10 containing 90 percent or more by dry weight of sugar 
and sugar syrups of subheading 2106.90, if any material provided for in 
subheading 1701.99 used in the production of such goods is not an originating 
good. 
 
5.  A good of Chapters 1-40 shall not be considered to be originating solely by reason of 
mere dilution with water or another substance that does not materially alter the 
characteristics of the good. 
 
6.  For purposes of Chapters 27-40, a “chemical reaction” is a process (including a 
biochemical process) which results in a molecule with a new structure by breaking 
intramolecular bonds and by forming new intramolecular bonds, or by altering the 
spatial arrangement of atoms in a molecule. 
    
 
3A-1  
  The following are not considered to be chemical reactions for the purposes of this 
definition: 
   
  (a) dissolving in water or other solvents; 
   
  (b) the eliminating of solvents including solvent water; or 
 
  (c) the addition or elimination of water of crystallization. 
 
  A chemical reaction as defined above is considered to result in an originating good. 
   
  Notwithstanding any of the line-by-line rules, the “chemical reaction” rule may be 
applied to any good classified in Chapters 28-40. 
   
7.  The following definitions apply: 
 
  (a) Chapter means a chapter of the Harmonized System; 
   
  (b) Heading means the first four digits in the tariff classification number under the 
Harmonised System; 
 
  (c) Section means a section of the Harmonized System; 
 
  (d) Subheading means the first six digits in the tariff classification number under the 
Harmonized System; and 
 
  (e) Split subheading means specific products which are a subset of a subheading.
