  3A-1 ANNEX  3A PRODUCT-SPECIFIC RULES OF ORIGIN  Notes:  1. The specific rule, or specific set of rules, that applies to a particular heading (4-digit code), subheading (6-digit code) or split subheading (ex. 6-digit code) is set out immediately adjacent to the heading, subheading or split subheading.  2. Unless otherwise specified in the Annex, a rule applicable to a split subheading shall take precedence over a rule applicable to the subheading which is parent to that split subheading.  In turn, a rule applicable to the subheading shall take precedence over a rule applicable to the heading which is parent to the subheading.  3. Reference to weight in the rules for goods provided for in Chapter 1 through 24 of the Harmonized System means dry weight unless otherwise specified in the Harmonized System.  4. A requirement of a change in tariff classification applies only to non-originating materials. The following are exceptions to change in tariff classification rules:    (i) agricultural and horticultural goods grown in the territory of a Party shall be treated as originating in the territory of that Party even if they are grown from seed, bulbs, rootstock, cuttings, slips or other live parts of plants imported from a non-Party; and      (ii) goods listed below which are exported from the territory of a Party, shall be treated as non-originating:    (a) heading 1202, if the goods were not harvested in the territory of a Party,    (b) subheading 2008.11, if any material provided for in heading 1202 used in the production of such goods was not harvested in the territory of a Party, or   (c) subheading 1806.10 containing 90 percent or more by dry weight of sugar and sugar syrups of subheading 2106.90, if any material provided for in subheading 1701.99 used in the production of such goods is not an originating good.  5. A good of Chapters 1-40 shall not be considered to be originating solely by reason of mere dilution with water or another substance that does not materially alter the characteristics of the good.  6. For purposes of Chapters 27-40, a “chemical reaction” is a process (including a biochemical process) which results in a molecule with a new structure by breaking intramolecular bonds and by forming new intramolecular bonds, or by altering the spatial arrangement of atoms in a molecule.       3A-2  The following are not considered to be chemical reactions for the purposes of this definition:    (a) dissolving in water or other solvents;    (b) the eliminating of solvents including solvent water; or   (c) the addition or elimination of water of crystallization.   A chemical reaction as defined above is considered to result in an originating good.    Notwithstanding any of the line-by-line rules, the “chemical reaction” rule may be applied to any good classified in Chapters 28-40.   7. The following definitions apply:   (a) Chapter means a chapter of the Harmonized System;    (b) Heading means the first four digits in the tariff classification number under the Harmonised System;   (c) Section means a section of the Harmonized System;   (d) Subheading means the first six digits in the tariff classification number under the Harmonized System; and   (e) Split subheading means specific products which are a subset of a subheading.   3A-3  Tariff item (HS96) Description of products Specific Rule CHAPTER 1  (e) LIVE ANIMALS  0101  Live horses, asses, mules and hinnies.
