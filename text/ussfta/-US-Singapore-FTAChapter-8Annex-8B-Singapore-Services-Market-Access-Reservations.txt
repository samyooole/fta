8B-Singapore-1  ANNEX 8B SCHEDULE OF SINGAPORE   Headnotes:  1.  Local Presence and National Treatment are separate disciplines and a measure that is only inconsistent with Local Presence need not be reserved against National Treatment.   2.  References to CPC codes refer to the provisional CPC codes as used in the Provisional Central Product Classification (Statistical Papers Series M No. 77, Department of International Economic and Social Affairs, Statistical Office of the United Nations, New York, 1991) and are meant to define the scope of the reservation unless otherwise stated.   3. The carve-out for subsidies in the Chapter on Cross-Border Trade in Services includes subsidies or grants provided by a Party to service consumers.  4. The carve-outs for financial services, subsidies, and government procurement in the Chapter on Cross-Border Trade in Services apply equally to the Investment Chapter.   5.  Where an inconsistency arises in relation to the interpretation of a reservation, the Description column or portion of the reservation shall prevail to the extent of the inconsistency.  6.  For greater certainty, the fact that Singapore has described a measure in the Description element of a Schedule entry does not necessarily mean that, in the absence of such a Schedule entry, the measure would be inconsistent with Singapore’s obligations under Chapter 8 (Cross-Border Trade in Services), Chapter 10 (Financial Services), or Chapter 15 (Investment).                 8B-Singapore-2   SINGAPORE’S SCHEDULE TO ANNEX 8B  Sector  -  Sub-sector  -  Industry Classification  -  Obligations concerned   National Treatment  Market Access Local Presence  Senior Management and Boards of Directors  Level of Government Central 8B-Singapore-3  Description   Cross-Border Services and Investment:  I. Devolution of Services Provided in the Exercise of Governmental Authority  1. Singapore reserves the right to adopt and maintain the following measures solely as part of the act of devolving a service, that it is providing in the exercise of governmental authority* at the time the Agreement enters into force:  (a)  restricting the number of service suppliers;  (b)  allowing an enterprise, wholly or majority owned by the Government of Singapore, to be the sole service supplier or one amongst a limited number of service suppliers;  (c)  imposing restrictions on the composition of Senior Management and Board of Directors;   (d)  requiring local presence; and   (e)  specifying the juridical form of the service supplier(s).  2. To the extent possible, Singapore shall inform the United States of a service that it is providing in the exercise of governmental authority that it intends to devolve.  Singapore shall maintain information demonstrating that any service that it devolves was being provided in the exercise of governmental authority as of the date this Agreement enters into force, and upon request, provide this information to the United States prior to devolving any such service.    3. Where devolution is accompanied by a sale of shares or assets to any person, such sale shall be conducted in a manner that does not deny U.S. investors national treatment.  For clarity, a sale of shares or assets does not occur when the Government of Singapore wholly owns the shares and assets of an enterprise and then transfers, for a consideration, these shares and assets to a government holding company that it wholly owns.   4. Once any competition is allowed in a devolved service, it shall be permitted on a non-discriminatory basis and no preferential treatment shall be provided to the newly corporatized enterprise except as provided in paragraph 1.  Devolving a service means allowing an enterprise, wholly or majority-owned by the Government of Singapore and organized under the laws of Singapore, to take over and supply on a commercial basis, services that were provided in the exercise of governmental authority as of the date this Agreement enters into force.   8B-Singapore-4   If pursuant to Section I. of this reservation, Singapore has devolved a service to an enterprise that it wholly-owns and was organized under the laws of Singapore, and where justified by public health, welfare, safety concerns, or to safeguard the viability of critical economic infrastructure, Singapore reserves the right to adopt and maintain the following measures regarding the sale of any shares in that enterprise or any assets of that enterprise to any person:  II.  Divestment of Government Ownership Interests After Devolution   (a) foreign ownership limitation: limit foreign ownership to no greater than 49 % of the shares of the enterprise  (b) single share ownership limitation: impose non-discriminatory single-share ownership limits on private investors of 5 % or more of the share of the  enterprise.  (c) preferential shareholder rights: reserve preferential shareholder rights for itself.  (d) senior management and board of directors restrictions: impose restrictions on the composition of senior management and board of directors, provided that foreign investors are allowed to have representation on the board of directors that recognizes their ownership levels relative to other shareholders.  *A service supplied in the exercise of governmental authority means any service which is supplied neither on a commercial basis, nor in competition with one or more service suppliers.
