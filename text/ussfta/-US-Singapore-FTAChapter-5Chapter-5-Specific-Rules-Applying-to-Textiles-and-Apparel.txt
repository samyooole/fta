The host Party shall prohibit those officials and any other person in its territory from  notifying an enterprise in advance of a visit.  The responsible officials of the host Party shall seek permission to conduct a site visit from a responsible person at the enterprise at the time of the visit.     4.   Responsible officials of the Party seeking to conduct site visits in the territory of the other Party shall conduct such visits together with responsible officials of the host Party and in    46 accordance with the laws of the host Party.

If Singapore suspects that the conduct noted in a report under  5-2 Singapore shall ensure that its officials have the authority to examine textile and apparel goods imported into Singapore, exported from Singapore, processed or manipulated in a free trade zone, or transshipped in Singapore en route to the United States, to ascertain that these goods correctly identify their country of origin, that the documents accompanying the goods correctly describe the goods, and that information that Singapore officials discover in the course of such examinations may be shared with the United States. 5-3 With regard to transshipped textile or apparel goods that are not claimed to be originating goods or products of Singapore, and that do not undergo processing or manipulation in a free trade zone, Singapore is not required to take  any action other than to share information about such goods with the United States.    48 either the first sentence of this paragraph or Article 5.3.4 involves intentional circumvention, it shall immediately investigate and report the results of the investigation to the United States within 14 days of the conclusion of the investigation.

(b)   If the United States finds that an enterprise of Singapore has engaged in intentional circumvention, then beginning on the date of the finding it may deny entry into the United States, during a period no longer than the applicable period described in paragraph 6, of textile or apparel goods that the enterprise has produced or exported.   (a)  With respect to a first finding under paragraph 5(a) or a first finding under paragraph 5(b), the applicable period is six months.

(c)  With respect to any further finding under paragraph 5(a) or 5(b), the applicable period shall be two years, except that where measures a Party imposed with respect to the enterprise as a result of an earlier finding under paragraph 5(a) or 5(b) are still in effect, the applicable period shall be extended by the period remaining before those measures expire.   ARTICLE 5.6 : INFORMATION SHARING  1.   Within three months after the date this Chapter takes effect, Singapore shall notify the United States in writing of the names of all registered enterprises.

A Party shall not disclose to a non-Party for law enforcement purposes or in connection with judicial proceedings information relating to intentional circumvention that the other Party has provided to the Party pursuant to Article 5.3, 5.4, 5.5 or 5.6, unless the other Party consents to the disclosure.   3.   (a)   Subject to subparagraph (b), nothing in this Chapter shall prevent a Party from making public the name of an enterprise that the Party has found to have engaged in intentional circumvention or that has failed to demonstrate its production of or capability to produce textile or apparel goods as provided under this Chapter.               4.     51 (b)  If a Party makes public the name of an enterprise as described in sub-paragraph (a) and the finding underlying the disclosure is based on information provided by the other Party pursuant to Article 5.3, 5.4, 5.5 or 5.6, the Party making the disclosure shall not disclose the information provided by the other Party or the fact that it based its finding on information provided by the other Party, unless the other Party consents to the disclosure of such information or such fact.   If a Party considers that the other Party has not maintained the confidentiality of information as required under this Article, it may make a written request to the other Party for consultations.  The Parties shall consult within 30 days after the request is delivered with a view to agreeing on appropriate steps to ensure compliance with this Article.   ARTICLE 5.8 : CONSULTATIONS AND RELATED MATTERS  1.

Unless the Parties agree otherwise, they shall commence consultations within 30 days of a Party’s receipt of a written request by the other Party and conclude consultations within 90 days of the Party’s receipt of the written request.   2.   If the Parties are unable to reach a mutually satisfactory solution under paragraph 1 and the United States has presented to Singapore clear evidence that circumvention has occurred, the United States may reduce the quantity of textile and apparel goods that may be imported into its territory from Singapore by an amount not to exceed three times the quantity of goods involved in the circumvention.  In addition, the United States may revoke any preferential tariff treatment provided pursuant to this Agreement to the goods involved in the circumvention, and deny such treatment, for a period not to exceed four years, to any textile or apparel goods produced by an enterprise found to have engaged in such circumvention, including any successor of the enterprise and any other entity owned or operated by a principal of the enterprise, if such entity, of which that person is a principal, produces textile or apparel goods.5-5       5-5 For purposes of this paragraph, the term “principal” means a person with principal ownership or control of an enterprise.     52 ARTICLE 5.9 : BILATERAL TEXTILE AND APPAREL SAFEGUARD ACTIONS  1.

In determining serious damage, or actual threat thereof, the Party:    (a)  shall examine the effect of increased imports on the particular industry, as reflected in changes in such relevant economic variables as output, productivity, utilization of capacity, inventories, market share, exports, wages, employment, domestic prices, profits, and investment, none of which is necessarily decisive; and   (b)  shall not consider changes in technology or consumer preference as factors supporting a determination of serious damage or actual threat thereof.   A Party shall deliver without delay written notice of its intent to take action under this Article to the other Party, and shall enter into consultations with that Party.    4.   The following conditions and limitations apply to any action taken under paragraph 1:    (a)  no action may be maintained for a period exceeding two years, except that the period may be extended by up to two years if the competent authorities of the Party applying the action determine, in conformity with the procedures set out in this Article, that the action continues to be necessary to prevent or remedy serious damage and to facilitate adjustment by the domestic industry, and that there is evidence that the industry is adjusting;              5.     53 (b)  no action may be taken by a Party against any particular good of the other Party more than once during the transition period; and    (c)  on termination of the action, the rate of duty shall be the rate that would have been in effect but for the action.   The Party taking an action under paragraph 1 shall provide to the Party against whose good the action is taken mutually agreed trade liberalizing compensation in the form of concessions having substantially equivalent trade effects or equivalent to the value of the additional duties expected to result from the emergency action.  Such concessions shall be limited to textile and apparel goods, unless the Parties otherwise agree.  If the Parties concerned are unable to agree on compensation within 30 days in the consultations under paragraph 3, the exporting Party may take action with respect to textile and apparel goods of the other Party that has trade effects substantially equivalent to the action taken under paragraph 1.  The Party taking such action shall apply the action only for the minimum period necessary to achieve the substantially equivalent effects.  However, the right to take such action shall not be exercised for the first 24 months that the action pursuant to paragraph 1 is in effect, provided that the action pursuant to paragraph 1 has been applied as a result of an absolute increase in imports and that such emergency action conforms to the provisions of this Article.   6.   Nothing in this Article shall be construed to affect a Party’s rights and obligations under Chapter 7, except that an action under this Article shall be considered a “safeguard measure” for purposes of Article 7.2.7 (Conditions and Limitations).
