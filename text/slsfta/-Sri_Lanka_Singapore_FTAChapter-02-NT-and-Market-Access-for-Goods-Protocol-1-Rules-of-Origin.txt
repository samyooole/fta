Where:  
 
(a) 
‚ÄúQVC‚Äù is the qualifying value content of the good, expressed as a percentage; 
 
(b) 
‚ÄúFOB‚Äù is the Free On Board value of the particular good determined in 
accordance with the Customs Valuation Agreement; and  
 
(c) 
‚ÄúVNM‚Äù is the value of non-originating materials used by the producer in the 
production of the good, calculated in accordance with paragraph 2 of this 
Article.  
 
2. 
For the purpose of calculating the value of non-originating materials pursuant to sub-
paragraph (c) above, the following formula shall be applied: 
 
ùëâùëÅùëÄ = ùëáùëâùëÄ ‚àí ùëÑùëâùëÄ 
 
Where:  
 
(a) 
‚ÄúTVM‚Äù is the total value of materials; and 
(b) 
‚ÄúQVM‚Äù is the qualifying value of materials, which shall be calculated as:  
 
i. 
the total value of the material if the material satisfies the rules 
established in Articles 4 (Wholly Obtained Products) and 5 (Sufficiently 
Worked or Processed Products), and the material has undergone its last 
production or operation in the territory of either Party; or  
 
ii. the value of the material that can be attributed to one or both of the 
Parties if the material does not satisfy the rule established in Articles 4 
(Wholly Obtained Products) and 5 (Sufficiently Worked or Processed 
Products).  
 
3. 
All costs considered for the calculation of qualifying value content shall be recorded 
and maintained in conformity with the Generally Accepted Accounting Principles 
applicable in the territory of the Party where the good is produced. 
 
 
Article 7 
De Minimis 
 
Notwithstanding sub-paragraph (a) of Article 5 (Sufficiently Worked or Processed Products), 
a good shall be considered to be originating if the value of all non-originating materials used 
in the production of that good which do not satisfy the requirement of change in tariff 
classification as set out in Article 5 (Sufficiently Worked or Processed Products) is not more 
than ten (10) percent of the FOB value of the good. 
 
 
 
Protocol 1

account as originating or non-originating materials, as the case may be, in 
calculating the regional value content of the good.  
Protocol 1 
 
 
 10 
 
 
2. 
Each Party shall provide that a good‚Äôs accessories, spare parts, tools or instructional 
or other information materials, as described in paragraph 3 of this Article, have the

instructional or other information materials are customary for that good.  
 
 
Article 11 
Sets 
 
Sets, as defined in General Interpretative Rule 3 of the HS, shall be regarded as originating 
when all component products are originating products. When a set is composed of originating 
and non-originating products, the set as a whole shall be regarded as originating, provided 
that the value of the non-originating products does not exceed fifteen (15) percent of the ex-
works price of the set.

treatment for a good imported into its territory from the territory of the other Party to: 
 
(a)  
make a declaration for preference as part of the import application prescribed 
by its legislation, based on importer‚Äôs knowledge or information including a 
valid Certificate of Origin, that the good qualifies as an originating good; 
 
(b)  
submit the Certificate of Origin or other documentary evidence of origin at the 
time of the declaration referred to in sub-paragraph (a) above, to its customs 
authorities upon request; and 
 
(c)

Article 25 
Waiver of Certificates of Origin 
 
Each Party shall provide that a Certificate of Origin shall not be required for the importation 
of any good whose custom value does not exceed US$400 or its equivalent amount in the 
Party‚Äôs currency; or such higher amount as may be established by a Party which is importing, 
provided that the importation does not form part of a series of importations that may 
reasonably be considered to have been undertaken or arranged for the purpose of avoiding the 
declaration requirements. 
 
                                                           
4 For greater certainty, a Party may require, as a condition for the release of the goods, a guarantee in the form 
of a surety, a deposit or other appropriate instrument provided for in its laws and regulations. Such guarantee
