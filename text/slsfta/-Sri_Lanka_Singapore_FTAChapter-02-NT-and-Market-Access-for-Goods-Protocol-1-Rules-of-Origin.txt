Where:  
 
(a) 
‚ÄúQVC‚Äù is the qualifying value content of the good, expressed as a percentage; 
 
(b) 
‚ÄúFOB‚Äù is the Free On Board value of the particular good determined in 
accordance with the Customs Valuation Agreement; and  
 
(c) 
‚ÄúVNM‚Äù is the value of non-originating materials used by the producer in the 
production of the good, calculated in accordance with paragraph 2 of this 
Article.  
 
2. 
For the purpose of calculating the value of non-originating materials pursuant to sub-
paragraph (c) above, the following formula shall be applied: 
 
ùëâùëÅùëÄ = ùëáùëâùëÄ ‚àí ùëÑùëâùëÄ 
 
Where:  
 
(a) 
‚ÄúTVM‚Äù is the total value of materials; and 
(b) 
‚ÄúQVM‚Äù is the qualifying value of materials, which shall be calculated as:  
 
i. 
the total value of the material if the material satisfies the rules 
established in Articles 4 (Wholly Obtained Products) and 5 (Sufficiently 
Worked or Processed Products), and the material has undergone its last 
production or operation in the territory of either Party; or  
 
ii. the value of the material that can be attributed to one or both of the 
Parties if the material does not satisfy the rule established in Articles 4 
(Wholly Obtained Products) and 5 (Sufficiently Worked or Processed 
Products).  
 
3. 
All costs considered for the calculation of qualifying value content shall be recorded 
and maintained in conformity with the Generally Accepted Accounting Principles 
applicable in the territory of the Party where the good is produced. 
 
 
Article 7 
De Minimis 
 
Notwithstanding sub-paragraph (a) of Article 5 (Sufficiently Worked or Processed Products), 
a good shall be considered to be originating if the value of all non-originating materials used 
in the production of that good which do not satisfy the requirement of change in tariff 
classification as set out in Article 5 (Sufficiently Worked or Processed Products) is not more 
than ten (10) percent of the FOB value of the good. 
 
 
 
Protocol 1

account as originating or non-originating materials, as the case may be, in 
calculating the regional value content of the good.  
Protocol 1 
 
 
 10 
 
 
2. 
Each Party shall provide that a good‚Äôs accessories, spare parts, tools or instructional 
or other information materials, as described in paragraph 3 of this Article, have the

instructional or other information materials are customary for that good.  
 
 
Article 11 
Sets 
 
Sets, as defined in General Interpretative Rule 3 of the HS, shall be regarded as originating 
when all component products are originating products. When a set is composed of originating 
and non-originating products, the set as a whole shall be regarded as originating, provided 
that the value of the non-originating products does not exceed fifteen (15) percent of the ex-
works price of the set.

period to the customs authorities of the importing Party.  
 
2.  
Certificates of Origin which are submitted to the customs authorities of the importing 
Party after the period of validity specified in paragraph 1 of this Article may be 
accepted for the purposes of applying preferential treatment, where the failure to 
submit these documents within such period is due to exceptional circumstances. 
 
3.  
In cases of belated submission of Certificates of Origin in circumstances other than 
those provided for in paragraph 2 of this Article, the customs authorities of the 
importing Party may accept the Certificates of Origin where the products have been

Article. 
 
 
Article 23 
Claims for Preferential Treatment 
 
1.  
Each Party shall require an importer in its territory that claims preferential tariff 
treatment for a good imported into its territory from the territory of the other Party to: 
 
(a)  
make a declaration for preference as part of the import application prescribed 
by its legislation, based on importer‚Äôs knowledge or information including a 
valid Certificate of Origin, that the good qualifies as an originating good; 
 
(b)  
submit the Certificate of Origin or other documentary evidence of origin at the 
time of the declaration referred to in sub-paragraph (a) above, to its customs 
authorities upon request; and 
 
(c)  
promptly make a corrected declaration and pay any duties owing, where the 
importer has reason to believe that a Certificate of Origin on which a 
declaration was based contains information that is incorrect. 
 
Protocol 1 
 
 
 17 
 
2.  
Each Party shall provide that the importing Party applies preferential tariff treatment 
only in cases where an importer proves the accuracy of origin of the imported goods 
through documentary evidence or any other relevant information in accordance with 
its laws and regulations. 
 
3.  
A Party may deny preferential tariff treatment to an imported good if the importer 
fails to comply with requirements of this Protocol. 
 
4.  
The importing Party shall grant preferential tariff treatment to goods imported after 
the date of entry into force of this Agreement, in cases where the importer does not 
have the Certificate of Origin or other documentary evidence of origin at the time of 
importation, provided that4: 
 
(a)  
the importer had, at the time of importation, indicated to the customs 
authorities of the importing Party his intention to claim preferential tariff 
treatment; and 
 
(b)  
the Certificate of Origin or other documentary evidence of origin is submitted 
to its customs authorities within such period from the date of payment of 
customs duties in accordance with the domestic laws and regulations in the 
importing Party. 
 
 
Article 24 
Importation by Instalments 
 
Where, at the request of the importer and on the conditions laid down by the customs 
authorities of the importing Party, dismantled or non-assembled products are imported by 
instalments, a single Certificate of Origin for such products may be submitted to the customs 
authorities upon importation of the first instalment.  
 
 
Article 25 
Waiver of Certificates of Origin 
 
Each Party shall provide that a Certificate of Origin shall not be required for the importation 
of any good whose custom value does not exceed US$400 or its equivalent amount in the 
Party‚Äôs currency; or such higher amount as may be established by a Party which is importing, 
provided that the importation does not form part of a series of importations that may 
reasonably be considered to have been undertaken or arranged for the purpose of avoiding the 
declaration requirements. 
 
                                                           
4 For greater certainty, a Party may require, as a condition for the release of the goods, a guarantee in the form 
of a surety, a deposit or other appropriate instrument provided for in its laws and regulations. Such guarantee 
shall not be greater than the amount required by the Party to ensure payment of customs duties, taxes, fees and 
charges ultimately due for the goods should preferential treatment not be granted.

 18 
 
 
Article 26 
Preservation of Certificates of Origin and Supporting Documents 
 
1.  
Each Party shall provide that an exporter and a producer in its territory that has 
obtained a Certificate of Origin shall maintain in its territory, for three (3) years after 
the date on which the Certificate of Origin was issued or for such longer period as the 
Party may specify, all records relating to the origin of a good for which preferential 
tariff treatment was claimed in the territory of the other Party, including records 
associated with: 
 
(a) 
the purchase of, cost of, value of, shipping of, and payment for, the good that 
is exported from its territory; 
 
(b) 
the sourcing of, the purchase of, cost of, value of, and payment for, all 
materials, including neutral elements, used in the production of the good that is 
exported from its territory; and 
 
(c) 
the production of the good in the form in which the good is exported from its 
territory. 
 
2.  
Each Party shall provide that an importer claiming preferential tariff treatment for a 
good imported into the Party's territory shall maintain in that territory, for three (3) 
years after the date of importation of the good or for such longer period as the Party 
may specify, such documentation, including a copy of the Certificate of Origin, as the 
Party may require relating to the importation of the good. 
 
3.  
Each Party shall permit, in accordance with that Party‚Äôs laws and regulations, 
exporters in its territory to maintain documentation or records in any medium, 
provided that the documentation or records can be retrieved and printed.  
 
 
Article 27 
Discrepancies and Formal Errors 
 
1.  
The discovery of slight discrepancies between the statements made in the Certificate 
of Origin and those made in the documents submitted to the customs authorities for 
the purposes of carrying out the formalities for importing the products shall not ipso 
facto render the Certificate of Origin null and void if it is duly established that this 
document does correspond to the products imported.  
 
2.  
Obvious formal errors such as typing errors on a Certificate of Origin should not 
cause the document to be rejected if these errors are not such as to create doubts 
concerning the correctness of the statements made in the document.

other, through their competent authorities, in checking the authenticity of the origin 
declarations and the correctness of the information given in these documents.  
 
 
Article 29 
Verification  
 
1. 
For the purposes of determining whether a good imported into its territory from the 
territory of the other Party is eligible for preferential tariff treatment, the importing 
Party may, through its customs authorities, conduct a verification, which may be in 
sequence, by means of: 
 
(a)  request for a Certificate of Origin from the importer; 
 
(b) 
request for Cost and Production Statement and information from an exporter or a 
producer in the territory of the other Party through the other Party‚Äôs competent 
authorities; 
 
(c) 
visit to the premises of an exporter or a producer in the territory of the other Party 
to review the records referred to in paragraph 1 of Article 26 (Preservation of 
Certificates of Origin and Supporting Documents) and observe the facilities used 
in the production of the good, or to that effect any facilities used in the production 
of the materials; or 
 
(d)  such other procedure as the Parties may agree to. 
 
2.  
The importer, exporter or producer that receives a written request pursuant to sub-
paragraphs 1(a) or 1(b) of this Article shall answer and return it within a period of sixty 
(60) days from the date on which it was received. During this period, the importer, 
exporter or producer may have one opportunity to make a written request to the Party 
conducting the verification for an extension of the answering period, for a period not 
exceeding thirty (30) days. 
 
Protocol 1 
 
 
 20 
 
3. 
In the case where the importer, exporter, or producer does not return the written request 
for information made by the importing Party within the given period or its extension, or 
that the information provided is false or incomplete, the Party may deny preferential 
tariff treatment. 
 
4.

Party shall, through its customs authorities: 
 
(a)  deliver a written notification of its intention to conduct the visit to: 
 
(i)  
the exporter or producer whose premises are to be visited; and 
(ii)  the competent authorities of the other Party; and 
 
(b)  obtain the written consent of the exporter or producer whose premises are to be 
visited. 
 
5.

verification visit within thirty (30) days from the receipt of notification pursuant to 
paragraph 4 of this Article, the notifying Party may deny preferential tariff treatment to 
the relevant good. 
 
6.  
Each Party shall provide that, upon receipt of notification pursuant to paragraph 4 of 
this Article, such an exporter or producer may, within thirty (30) days of receiving the 
notification, have one opportunity to request to the Party conducting the verification for 
a postponement of the proposed verification visit, for a period not exceeding sixty (60) 
days. This extension shall be notified to the customs authorities of the importing and 
exporting Parties. 
 
7.

verification visit was postponed pursuant to paragraph 6 of this Article. 
 
8.  
After the conclusion of a verification visit, the Party conducting the verification, shall 
provide the exporter or producer whose good was verified, with a written determination 
of whether the good is eligible for preferential tariff treatment, based on the relevant 
law and findings of fact. 
 
9.  
Where verifications by a Party show that an exporter or producer repeatedly makes 
false or unsupported representations that a good imported into the Party‚Äôs territory 
qualifies as an originating good, the Party may suspend the preferential tariff treatment 
to be accorded to subsequent shipment of identical good exported or produced by such 
a person until that person establishes that the shipment complies with this Protocol, in 
accordance with its domestic laws, regulations or practices. The importing Party shall 
inform the competent authorities of the exporting Party on the evidence and details of 
the suspension made.
