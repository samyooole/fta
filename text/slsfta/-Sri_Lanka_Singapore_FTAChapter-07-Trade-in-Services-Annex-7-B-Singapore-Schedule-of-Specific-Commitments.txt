Annex 7-B  1  ANNEX 7-B  SINGAPORE  SCHEDULE OF SPECIFIC COMMITMENTS  EXPLANATORY NOTES  1. The classification of service sectors in this schedule is based on the 1991 provisional Central Product Classification (CPC) of the United Nations Statistical Office unless otherwise indicated by the absence of a CPC number. The ordering reflects the services sectoral classification list as used in the GATT document MTN.GNS/W/120 dated 10 July 1991. The scheduling of specific commitments follows the guidelines stated in GATT documents MTN.GNS/W/164 dated 3 September 1993 and MTN.GNS/W/164/Add.1 dated 30 November 1993.  2. The use of “**” against individual CPC codes indicates that the specific commitment for that code shall not extend to the total range of services covered under that code.   3. The list of commitments below (hereinafter referred to as “this Schedule”) indicates the service sectors liberalised pursuant to Article 7.6 (Schedule of Specific Commitments), and, by means of reservations, the market access and national treatment limitations that apply to services and service suppliers of Sri Lanka in those sectors. This Schedule is composed of the following elements:  (a) the first column indicating the sector or subsector in which the commitment is undertaken by Singapore, and the scope of liberalisation to which the reservations apply;  (b) the second column describing the applicable reservations to Article 7.3 (Market Access) in the sector or subsector indicated in the first column;  (c) the third column describing the applicable reservations to Article 7.4 (National Treatment) in the sector or subsector indicated in the first column; and  (d)  the fourth column describing specific commitments on measures affecting the cross-border supply of services and establishment in service sectors not subject to scheduling under Article 7.3 (Market Access) and Article 7.4 (National Treatment).  4. Notwithstanding Article 7.3 (Market Access), non-discriminatory requirements as regards the types of legal form of an establishment do not need to be specified in this Schedule in order to be maintained or adopted by Singapore.  5.  This Schedule does not include measures relating to qualification requirements and procedures, technical standards and licensing requirements when they do not constitute a market access or a national treatment limitation within the meaning of Article 7.3 (Market Access) and Article 7.4 (National Treatment). Those measures (e.g. need to obtain a license, universal service obligations, need to obtain recognition Annex 7-B  2  of qualifications in regulated sectors, and need to pass specific examinations, including language examinations and need to have a legal domicile in the territory where the economic activity is performed), even if not listed, apply in any case to services and service suppliers of Sri Lanka.  6.  This Schedule shall not apply to measures affecting State Land, and to the alienation and divestment of real estate owned by the State.  7.  In accordance with Article 7.2 (Scope and Coverage), this Schedule shall not apply to subsidies or grants provided by a Party, including government-supported loans, guarantees and insurance; or to any conditions attached to the receipt or continued receipt of such subsidies or grants, whether or not such subsidies are offered exclusively to domestic services, service consumers or service suppliers.
