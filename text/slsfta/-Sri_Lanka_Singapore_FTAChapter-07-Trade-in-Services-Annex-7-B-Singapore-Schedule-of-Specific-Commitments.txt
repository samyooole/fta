ANNEX 7-B 
 
SINGAPORE 
 
SCHEDULE OF SPECIFIC COMMITMENTS 
 
EXPLANATORY NOTES 
 
1.  The classification of service sectors in this schedule is based on the 1991 provisional 
Central Product Classification (CPC) of the United Nations Statistical Office unless 
otherwise  indicated  by  the  absence  of  a  CPC number.  The  ordering  reflects  the 
services sectoral classification list as used in the GATT document MTN.GNS/W/120 
dated 10 July 1991. The scheduling of specific commitments follows the guidelines 
stated  in  GATT  documents  MTN.GNS/W/164  dated  3  September  1993  and 
MTN.GNS/W/164/Add.1 dated 30 November 1993. 
 
2.  The use of “**” against individual CPC codes indicates that the specific commitment 
for that code shall not extend to the total range of services covered under that code.  
 
3.  The list of commitments below (hereinafter referred to as “this Schedule”) indicates 
the  service  sectors  liberalised  pursuant  to  Article  7.6  (Schedule  of  Specific 
Commitments),  and,  by  means  of  reservations,  the  market  access  and  national 
treatment limitations that apply to services and service suppliers of Sri Lanka in those 
sectors. This Schedule is composed of the following elements: 
 
(a)  the first column indicating the sector or subsector in which the commitment is 
undertaken  by  Singapore,  and  the  scope  of  liberalisation  to  which  the 
reservations apply; 
 
(b)  the  second  column  describing  the  applicable  reservations  to  Article  7.3 
(Market Access) in the sector or subsector indicated in the first column; 
 
(c)  the third column describing the applicable reservations to Article 7.4 (National 
Treatment) in the sector or subsector indicated in the first column; and 
 
(d)   the fourth column describing specific commitments on measures affecting the 
cross-border supply of services and establishment in service sectors not subject 
to scheduling under Article 7.3 (Market Access) and Article 7.4 (National 
Treatment). 
 
4.  Notwithstanding  Article  7.3  (Market  Access),  non-discriminatory  requirements  as 
regards the types of legal form of an establishment do not need to be specified in this 
Schedule in order to be maintained or adopted by Singapore. 
 
5.   This Schedule does not include measures relating to qualification requirements and 
procedures,  technical  standards  and  licensing  requirements  when  they  do  not 
constitute a market access or a national treatment limitation within the meaning of 
Article 7.3 (Market Access) and Article 7.4 (National Treatment). Those measures 
(e.g. need to obtain a license, universal service obligations, need to obtain recognition 
1 
 Annex 7-B 
 
of  qualifications  in  regulated  sectors,  and  need  to  pass  specific  examinations, 
including language examinations and need to have a legal domicile in the territory 
where the economic activity is performed), even if not listed, apply in any case to 
services and service suppliers of Sri Lanka. 
 
6.   This Schedule shall not apply to measures affecting State Land, and to the alienation 
and divestment of real estate owned by the State. 
 
7.   In accordance with Article 7.2 (Scope and Coverage), this Schedule shall not apply to 
subsidies  or  grants  provided  by  a  Party,  including  government-supported  loans, 
guarantees and insurance; or to any conditions attached to the receipt or continued 
receipt  of  such  subsidies  or  grants,  whether  or  not  such  subsidies  are  offered 
exclusively to domestic services, service consumers or service suppliers.
