Meat and meat products must be imported from AVA accredited countries 
and meat establishments. The accreditation procedure is a two-stage process. 
The first stage involves country accreditation, where the country is assessed 
for regulatory oversight and freedom from animal diseases of important 
trade and public health concerns (e.g. Foot-and-Mouth Disease, Bovine 
spongiform encephalopathy, Highly pathogenic avian influenza, etc). The 
second stage involves the individual establishment accreditation, where the 
slaughterhouse/processing plant is assessed for food safety and hygienic 
processing. This involves submission of a documentary dossier, followed by 
an inspection. 
 
Sri Lanka must first be accredited by AVA as an exporting country:
