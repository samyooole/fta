The Parties recognise the importance of free and undistorted competition in their trade relations. They acknowledge that anti-competitive business conduct or anti-competitive transactions have the potential to distort the proper functioning of their markets and undermine the benefits of trade liberalisation.  2. To promote free and undistorted competition in all sectors of their economies, the Parties shall introduce or maintain 1  comprehensive legislation in their respective territories, which effectively address:   (a) horizontal agreements between undertakings, decisions by associations of undertakings and concerted practices, which have as their object or effect the prevention, restriction or distortion of competition in their own territory as a whole or in a substantial part thereof;  (b) abuses by one or more undertakings of a dominant position in their own territory as a whole or in a substantial part thereof; and  (c) concentrations between undertakings which result in a substantial lessening of competition or which significantly impede effective competition, in particular as a result of the creation or strengthening of a dominant position in their own territory as a whole or in a substantial part thereof;  which affect trade between them.   Article 12.2 Implementation  1. The Parties shall maintain autonomy in developing and enforcing their respective laws. The Parties undertake, however, to maintain authorities responsible and appropriately equipped for the effective enforcement of the legislation referred to in paragraph 2 of Article 12.1 (Principles).  2. The Parties will apply their respective legislation referred to in paragraph 2 of Article 12.1 (Principles) in a transparent and non-discriminatory manner, respecting the principles of procedural fairness and rights of defence of the parties concerned, including the right of the parties concerned to be heard prior to deciding on a case.                                                            1 Sri Lanka does not have legislation dealing comprehensively with competition policy.
