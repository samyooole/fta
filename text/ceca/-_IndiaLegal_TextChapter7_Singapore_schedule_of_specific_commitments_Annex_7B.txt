ANNEX 7B 
 
SINGAPORE’S SCHEDULE OF SPECIFIC COMMITMENTS 
 
EXPLANATORY NOTES 
 
1. 
The classification of service sectors in this schedule is based on the 1991 
provisional Central Product Classification (CPC) of the United Nations Statistical 
Office unless otherwise indicated by the absence of a CPC number.  The ordering 
reflects the services sectoral classification list as used in the GATT document 
MTN.GNS/W/120 dated 10 July 1991.  The scheduling of specific commitments 
follows the guidelines stated in GATT documents MTN.GNS/W/164 dated 3 
September 1993 and MTN.GNS/W/164/Add.1 dated 30 November 1993.  
 
2. 
The use of  “ ** ” against individual CPC codes indicates that the specific 
commitment for that code shall not extend to the total range of services covered 
under that code.  The entry “Unbound*” means unbound due to lack of technical 
feasibility. 
 
3. 
Cabotage services in the maritime transport sector are not listed in this 
Schedule, as Chapter 7 does not apply to those services.
