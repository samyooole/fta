 
Expropriation (Annex 3) 
 
1. 
The Parties confirm the following understanding with respect to the 
interpretation and/or implementation of Chapter 6 on Investment of the India-
Singapore Comprehensive Economic Cooperation Agreement (the “Agreement’):  
 
(a) 
Article 6.5 of the Agreement is intended to reflect customary 
international law concerning the obligations of States with respect to 
expropriation;  
 
(b) 
a measure of expropriation includes, apart from direct expropriation or 
nationalisation through formal transfer of title or outright seizure, a 
measure or series of measures taken by a Party that has an effect 
equivalent to direct expropriation or nationalization, without a formal 
transfer of title or outright seizure; 
 
(c) 
an action or series of actions by a Party cannot constitute an 
expropriation unless it interferes with a tangible or intangible property 
right or property interest in an investment; 
 
(d)  
the determination of whether a measure or series of measures of a 
Party in a specific factual situation, constitute measures as referred to 
in paragraph (b) above requires a case-by-case, fact-based inquiry that 
considers, among other factors: 
 
(i) 
the economic impact of the measure or series of measures, 
although the fact that a measure or series of measures by a 
Party has an adverse effect on the economic value of an 
investment, standing alone, does not establish that measures 
having effect equivalent to nationalization or expropriation, has 
occurred;  
 
(ii) 
the extent to which the measure or series of measure interfere 
with distinct, reasonable, investment-backed expectations; 
 
(iii)  
character of the measure or series of measures, including inter 
alia, their intent, objectives, purpose, and degree of nexus 
between the measures and outcome or effects that forms the 
basis of the expropriation claim; and 
 
(e) 
except in rare circumstances, non-discriminatory regulatory actions by 
a Party that are designed and applied for legitimate public welfare 
objectives such as health, safety and the environment, do not constitute 
measures having effect equivalent to nationalization or expropriation.
