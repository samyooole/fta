This Chapter shall not apply to measures affecting natural persons seeking access to the employment market of a Party, nor shall it apply to measures regarding citizenship, residence or employment on a permanent basis.   6. Nothing in this Chapter shall prevent a Party from applying measures to regulate the entry of natural persons of the other Party into, or their temporary stay in, its territory, including those measures necessary to protect the integrity of, and to ensure the orderly movement of natural persons across its borders, provided that such measures are not applied in such a manner as to nullify or impair the benefits accruing to the other Party under the terms of this Chapter as well as the terms of specific commitments undertaken.   ARTICLE 7.3: MARKET ACCESS   1. With respect to market access through the modes of supply defined in paragraph  (r) of Article 7.1, each Party shall accord services and service suppliers of the other Party treatment no less favourable than that provided for under the terms, limitations and conditions agreed and specified in its Schedule of specific commitments.7-2  2. In sectors where market access commitments are undertaken, the measures which a Party shall not maintain or adopt either on the basis of a regional subdivision or on the basis of its entire territory, unless otherwise specified in its Schedule of specific commitments, are defined as:   (a)  limitations on the number of service suppliers whether in the form of numerical quotas, monopolies, exclusive service suppliers or the requirements of an economic needs test;  (b)  limitations on the total value of service transactions or assets in the form of numerical quotas or the requirement of an economic needs test;  (c)  limitations on the total number of service operations or on  the total quantity   of service output  expressed  in terms  of designated   numerical units  in the form of  quotas or the requirement of an economic needs test7-3;  (d)  limitations on the total number of natural persons that may be employed in a particular service sector or that a service supplier may employ and                                                  7-2 If a Party undertakes a market-access commitment in relation to the supply of a service through the mode of supply referred to in Article 7.1(r)(i) and if the cross-border movement of capital is an essential part of the service itself, that Party is thereby committed to allow such movement of capital.  If a Party undertakes a market-access commitment in relation to the supply of a service through the mode of supply referred to in Article 7.1(r)(iii), it is thereby committed to allow related transfers of capital into its territory.   7-3 paragraph 2(c) of Article 7.3 does not cover measures of a Party which limit inputs for the supply of services.   60  who are necessary for, and directly related to, the supply of a specific service in the form of numerical quotas or the requirement of an economic needs test;   (e)  measures which restrict or require specific types of legal entity or joint venture through which a service supplier may supply a service; and  (f)  limitations on the participation of foreign capital in terms of maximum percentage limit on foreign shareholding or the total value of individual or aggregate foreign investment.   ARTICLE 7.4: NATIONAL TREATMENT   1. In the sectors inscribed in its Schedule, and subject to any conditions and qualifications set out therein, each Party shall accord to services and service suppliers of the other Party, in respect of all measures affecting the supply of services, treatment no less favourable than that it accords to its own like services and service suppliers7-4.  2. Any subsequent establishment, acquisition and expansion of investments by a service supplier that is incorporated, constituted, set up or otherwise duly organized under the law of a Party, and which is owned by a service supplier of the other Party, shall be regarded as an investment of the other Party, for the purpose of determining the applicable treatment to be accorded under this paragraph 7-5.   3.  The treatment to be accorded by a Party under paragraph 1 means, with respect to a regional or local level, treatment no less favourable than the most favourable treatment accorded by that regional or local level to like service suppliers of the Party of which it forms a part.  4. A Party may meet the requirement of paragraph 1 by according to services and service suppliers of the other Party, either formally identical treatment or formally different treatment to that it accords to its own like services and service suppliers.  5. Formally identical or formally different treatment shall be considered to be less favourable if it modifies the conditions of competition in favour of services or service suppliers of a Party compared to like services or service suppliers of the other Party.                                                      7-4 Specific commitments assumed under this Article shall not be construed to require any Party to compensate for any inherent competitive disadvantages which result from the foreign character of the relevant services or service suppliers.  7-5 The Parties understand that such service suppliers shall be entitled to be accorded any better treatment which is available under the regime of that Party, at the time of such subsequent establishment, acquisition and expansion of investments.  Any such better treatment accorded shall not be construed as an automatic addition to the commitments scheduled in India's Schedule of Specific Commitments in Annex 6A or the Parties' respective Schedules in Annex 6B.   61  ARTICLE 7.5: ADDITIONAL COMMITMENTS   The Parties may negotiate commitments with respect to measures affecting trade in services not subject to scheduling under Articles 7.3 or 7.4, including those regarding qualifications, standards or licensing matters. Such commitments shall be inscribed in a Party's Schedule of specific commitments.     ARTICLE 7.6: REVIEW OF MOST FAVOURED NATION COMMITMENTS  If, after this Agreement enters into force, a Party enters into any agreement on trade in services with a non-Party, it shall give consideration to a request by the other Party for the incorporation herein of treatment no less favourable than that provided under the aforesaid agreement.  Any such incorporation should maintain the overall balance of commitments undertaken by each Party under this Agreement.   ARTICLE 7.7: SCHEDULE OF SPECIFIC COMMITMENTS   1.  Each Party shall set out in a schedule the specific commitments it undertakes under Articles 7.3, 7.4 and 7.5.  With respect to sectors where such commitments are undertaken, each Schedule of specific commitments shall specify:  (a) terms, limitations and conditions on market access;   (b) conditions and qualifications on national treatment;  (c) undertakings relating to additional commitments;   (d) where appropriate the time frame for implementation of such commitments; and  (e) the date of entry into force of such commitments.  2.  Measures inconsistent with both Articles 7.3 and 7.4 shall be inscribed in both the columns relating to Article 7.3 and Article 7.4.   3. Schedules of specific commitments shall be annexed to this Chapter as Annex 7A and Annex 7B and shall form an integral part of this Agreement.   ARTICLE 7.8: MODIFICATION OF SCHEDULES  1. A Party may modify or withdraw any commitment in its Schedule, at any time after three years have elapsed from the date on which that commitment entered into force, in accordance with the provisions of this Article.  It shall notify the other Party of its intent to so modify or withdraw a commitment no later than three months before the intended date of implementation of the modification or withdrawal.    62  2. At the request of the other Party, the modifying Party shall enter into negotiations with a view to reaching agreement on any necessary compensatory adjustment.  In such negotiations and agreement, the Party shall endeavour to maintain a general level of mutually advantageous commitments not less favourable to trade than that provided for in Schedules of specific commitments prior to such negotiations.  The Parties shall endeavour to conclude negotiations on such compensatory adjustment to mutual satisfaction within six months, failing which recourse may be had to the provisions of Chapter 15 of this Agreement.    ARTICLE 7.9: PROGRESSIVE LIBERALISATION  The Parties shall endeavour to review their schedules of specific commitments at least once every three years, or earlier, at the request of either Party, with a view to facilitating the elimination of substantially all remaining discrimination between the Parties with regard to trade in Services covered in this Chapter over a period of time.  In this process, there shall be due respect for the national policy objectives and the level of development of the Parties, both overall and in individual sectors.     ARTICLE 7.10: DOMESTIC REGULATION   1. In sectors where specific commitments are undertaken, each Party shall ensure that all measures of general application affecting trade in services are administered in a reasonable, objective and impartial manner.   2. Each Party shall maintain or institute as soon as practicable judicial, arbitral or administrative tribunals or procedures which provide, at the request of an affected service supplier of the other Party, for the prompt review of, and where justified, appropriate remedies for, administrative decisions affecting trade in services. Where such procedures are not independent of the agency entrusted with the administrative decision concerned, the Party shall ensure that the procedures in fact provide for an objective and impartial review.   3. The provisions of paragraph 2 shall not be construed to require a Party to institute such tribunals or procedures where this would be inconsistent with its constitutional structure or the nature of its legal system.   4. Where authorisation is required for the supply of a service on which a specific commitment has been made, the competent authorities of a Party shall, within a reasonable period of time after the submission of an application considered complete under domestic laws and regulations, inform the applicant of the decision concerning the application.  At the request of the applicant, the competent authorities of the Party shall provide, without undue delay, information concerning the status of the application.   5. With the objective of ensuring that domestic regulation, including measures relating to qualification requirements and procedures, technical standards and licensing requirements, do not constitute unnecessary barriers to trade in services, the Parties shall jointly review the results of the negotiations on disciplines on these measures, pursuant to Article VI.4 of the WTO General Agreement on Trade in Services (GATS), with a   63  view to their incorporation into this Chapter. The Parties note that such disciplines aim to ensure that such requirements are inter alia:   (a) based on objective and transparent criteria, such as competence and the ability to  supply the service;  (b) not more burdensome than necessary to ensure the quality of the service;  (c)   in the case of licensing procedures, not in themselves a restriction on the supply of the service.    6. Pending the incorporation of disciplines pursuant to paragraph 5; for sectors where a Party has undertaken specific commitments and subject to any terms, limitations, conditions or qualifications set out therein, a Party shall not apply licensing and qualification requirements and technical standards that nullify or impair such specific commitments in a manner which:   (a) does not comply with the criteria outlined in paragraphs 5(a), 5(b) or 5(c); and   (b) could not reasonably have been expected of that Party at the time the specific commitments in those sectors were made.    7. In determining whether a Party is in conformity with the obligation under paragraph 6, account shall be taken of international standards of relevant international organisations7-6 applied by that Party.  8. In sectors where specific commitments regarding professional services are undertaken, each Party shall provide for adequate procedures to verify the competence of professionals of the other.   ARTICLE 7.11: RECOGNITION   1. For the purposes of the fulfilment of its standards or criteria for the authorisation, licensing or certification of services suppliers, a Party may recognise the education or experience obtained, requirements met, or licenses or certifications granted in the other Party.  2.      In accordance with their prior agreement, the Parties shall ensure that their respective professional bodies in the service sectors of accounting and auditing, architecture, medical (doctors), dental and nursing negotiate and conclude, within twelve months of the date of entry into force of this Agreement, any such agreements or arrangements providing for mutual recognition of the education or experience obtained, requirements met, or licenses or certifications in those service sectors, the details of such agreements or arrangements, including the exact extent and scope of recognition.  Any delay or failure by these professional bodies to reach and conclude agreement on the                                                  7-6 The term "relevant international organisations" refers to international bodies whose membership is open to the relevant bodies of both Parties.   64  details of such agreements or arrangements shall not be regarded as a breach of a Party's obligations under this paragraph and shall not be subject to the Dispute Settlement Chapter of this Agreement.  Progress in this regard will be continually reviewed by the Parties in the course of the review of this Agreement pursuant to Article 16.3.    3. After the entry into force of this Agreement, upon a request being made in writing by a Party to the other Party in any regulated service sector not covered in paragraph 2, the requested Party shall encourage its relevant professional, standard-setting or self- regulatory body in that service sector to enter into negotiations, within a reasonable period of time from the date of the request being received in writing, to negotiate agreements or arrangements providing for mutual recognition of education, or experience obtained, requirements met, or licenses or certifications granted in that Service Sector, with a view to the achievement of early outcomes.  Any delay or failure by these professional bodies to reach and conclude agreement on the details of such agreements or arrangements shall not be regarded as a breach of a Party’s obligations under this paragraph and shall not be subject to the Dispute Settlement Chapter of this Agreement.  Progress in this regard will be continually reviewed by the Parties in the course of the review of this Agreement pursuant to Article 16.3.    4. Where a Party recognises, by agreement or arrangement, the education or experience obtained, requirements met or licenses or certifications granted in the territory of a country that is not a Party to this Agreement, that Party shall accord the other Party, upon request, adequate opportunity to negotiate its accession to such an agreement or arrangement or to negotiate comparable ones with it.  Where a Party accords recognition autonomously, it shall afford adequate opportunity for the other Party to demonstrate that the education or experience obtained, requirements met or licenses or certifications granted in the territory of that other Party should also be recognised.  5. The Parties agree that they shall not be responsible in any way for the settlement of disputes arising out of or under the agreements or arrangements for mutual recognition concluded by their respective professional, standard-setting or self-regulatory bodies under the provisions of this Article and that the provisions of Chapter 15 shall not apply to disputes arising out of, or under, the provisions of such agreements or arrangements.    ARTICLE 7.12: MONOPOLIES AND EXCLUSIVE SERVICE SUPPLIERS   1.  Each Party shall ensure that any monopoly supplier of a service in its territory does not, in the supply of the monopoly service in the relevant market, act in a manner inconsistent with that Party's Schedule of specific commitments.  2. Where a Party's monopoly supplier competes, either directly or through an affiliated company, in the supply of a service outside the scope of its monopoly rights and which is subject to that Party's Schedule of specific commitments, the Party shall ensure that such a supplier does not abuse its monopoly position to act in its territory in a manner inconsistent with such commitments.  3.  If a Party has reason to believe that a monopoly supplier of a service of the other Party is acting in a manner inconsistent with paragraphs 1 or 2 above, it may request that   65  Party establishing, maintaining or authorising such supplier to provide specific information concerning the relevant operations.  4. The provisions of this Article shall also apply to cases of exclusive service suppliers, where a Party, formally or in effect:  (a) authorises or establishes a small number of service suppliers; and  (b)  substantially prevents competition among those suppliers in its territory.   ARTICLE 7.13: BUSINESS PRACTICES   1. The Parties recognise that certain business practices of service suppliers, other than those falling under Article 7.12, may restrain competition and thereby restrict trade in services.  2. A Party shall, at the request of the other Party, enter into consultations with a view to eliminating practices referred to in paragraph 1.  The Party addressed shall accord full and sympathetic consideration to such a request and shall co-operate through the supply of publicly available non-confidential information of relevance to the matter in question.  The Party addressed shall also provide other information available to the requesting Party, subject to its domestic law and to the conclusion of satisfactory agreement concerning the safeguarding of its confidentiality by the requesting Party.   ARTICLE 7.14: SAFEGUARD MEASURES  1. Neither Party shall take safeguard action against services and service suppliers of the other Party from the date of entry into force of this Agreement. Neither Party shall initiate or continue any safeguard investigations in respect of services and service suppliers of the other Party.   2.  The Parties shall review the issue of safeguard measures in the context of developments in international fora of which both parties are members.                                                                                       ARTICLE 7.15: SUBSIDIES  1.   The Parties shall review the treatment of subsidies in the context of developments in multilateral fora of which both Parties are Members.  2. In the event that either Party considers that its interests have been adversely affected by a subsidy or grant provided by the other Party, upon request, the other Party shall enter into consultations with a view to resolving the matter.  3. During the consultations referred to in paragraph 2, the subsidising Party may, as it deems fit, consider a request of the other Party for information relating to the subsidy scheme or programme such as:    66  (a) domestic laws or regulations under which the measure is introduced;  (b) form of the measure (e.g. grant, loan, tax concession);  (c) policy objective and/or purpose of the measure;  (d) dates and duration of the programme or subsidy and any other time limits attached to it; and  (e)  eligibility requirements of the measure (e.g. criteria applied with respect to the potential population of beneficiaries).   4. The provisions of Chapter 15 of this Agreement shall not apply to any requests made or consultations held under the provisions of this Article or to any disputes that may arise between the Parties out of, or under, the provisions of this Article.   ARTICLE 7.16: PAYMENTS AND TRANSFERS  1. Except under the circumstances envisaged in Article 7.17 a Party shall not apply restrictions on international transfers and payments for current transactions relating to its specific commitments.  2. Nothing in this Chapter shall affect the rights and obligations of the Parties as members of the International Monetary Fund under the Articles of Agreement of the Fund, including the use of exchange actions which are in conformity with the Articles of Agreement, provided that a Party shall not impose restrictions on any capital transactions inconsistently with its specific commitments regarding such transactions, except under Article 7.17 or at the request of the Fund.   ARTICLE 7.17: RESTRICTIONS TO SAFEGUARD THE BALANCE OF PAYMENTS   1. In the event of serious balance of payments and external financial difficulties or threat thereof, a Party may adopt or maintain restrictions on trade in services in respect of which it has obligations under Articles 7.3 and 7.4 or has made Additional Commitments including on payments or transfers for transactions relating to such obligations.  It is recognised that particular pressures on the balance of payments of a Party in the process of economic development may necessitate the use of restrictions to ensure, inter alia, the maintenance of a level of financial reserves adequate for the implementation of its programme of economic development.  2. The restrictions referred to in paragraph 1 shall:  (a) be consistent with the Articles of Agreement of the International Monetary Fund;  (b) avoid unnecessary damage to the commercial, economic and financial interests of the other Party;    67  (c) not exceed those necessary to deal with the circumstances described in   paragraph 1;  (d) be temporary and be phased out progressively as the situation specified  in paragraph 1 improves;   (e) be applied on a national treatment basis and such that the other Party is treated no less favourably than any country that is not a Party to this Agreement.  3. Any restrictions adopted or maintained under paragraph 1, or any changes therein, shall be promptly notified to the other Party.  4. The Party adopting any restrictions under paragraph 1 shall commence consultations with the other Party in order to review the restrictions adopted by it.   ARTICLE 7.18: TRANSPARENCY   1.  Each Party shall publish promptly and, except in emergency situations, at the latest by the time of their entry into force, all relevant measures of general application which pertain to or affect the operation of this Chapter.  International agreements pertaining to or affecting trade in services to which a Party is a signatory shall also be published.  2.  Where publication as referred to in paragraph 1 is not practicable, such information shall be made otherwise publicly available.  3. Each Party shall respond promptly to all requests by the other Party for specific information on any of its measures of general application or international agreements within the meaning of paragraph 1. Each Party shall also establish one or more enquiry points to provide specific information to other Party, upon request, on all such matters.   ARTICLE 7.19: DISCLOSURE OF CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION    Nothing in this Chapter shall require any Party to provide confidential information, the disclosure of which would impede law enforcement, or otherwise be contrary to the public interest, or which would prejudice legitimate commercial interests of particular enterprises, public or private.   ARTICLE 7.20: GOVERNMENT PROCUREMENT  Articles 7.3 and 7.4 shall not apply to laws, regulations or requirements governing the procurement by governmental agencies of services purchased for governmental purposes and not with a view to commercial resale or with a view to use in the supply of services for commercial sale.     68  ARTICLE 7.21: GENERAL EXCEPTIONS  1. Subject to the requirement that such measures are not applied in a manner which would constitute a means of arbitrary or unjustifiable discrimination against the other Party, or a disguised restriction on trade in services, nothing in this Chapter shall be construed to prevent the adoption or enforcement by either Party of measures:   (a) necessary to protect public morals or to maintain public order;7-7  (b) necessary to protect human, animal or plant life or health;  (c) necessary to secure compliance with laws or regulations which are not inconsistent with the provisions of this Chapter including those relating to:   (i) the prevention of deceptive and fraudulent practices or to deal with the effects of a default on services contracts;   (ii) the protection of the privacy of individuals in relation to the processing and dissemination of personal data and the protection of confidentiality of individual records and accounts;   (iii)       safety;  (d) inconsistent with Article 7.4, provided that the difference in treatment is aimed at ensuring the equitable or effective7-8 imposition or collection of direct taxes in respect of services or service suppliers of the other Party.                                                  7-7 The public order exception may be invoked by a Party, including its legislative, governmental, regulatory or judicial bodies, only where a genuine and sufficiently serious threat is posed to one of the fundamental interests of society.   7-8 Measures that are aimed at ensuring the equitable or effective imposition or collection of direct taxes include measures taken by a Party under  its taxation system which:  (i) apply to non-resident service suppliers in recognition of the fact that the tax obligation of non-residents is determined with respect to taxable items sourced or located in the Party's territory;  or  (ii) apply to non-residents in order to ensure the imposition or collection of taxes in the Party's territory;  or  (iii) apply to non-residents or residents in order to prevent the avoidance or evasion of taxes, including compliance measures;  or  (iv)  apply to consumers of services supplied in or from the territory of the other Party in order to      ensure the imposition or collection of taxes on such consumers derived from sources in the Party's territory;  or  (v) distinguish service suppliers subject to tax on world-wide taxable items from other service suppliers, in recognition of the difference in the nature of the tax base between them;  or  (vi) determine, allocate or apportion income, profit, gain, loss, deduction or credit of resident persons or branches, or between related persons or branches of the same person, in order to safeguard the Party's tax base.   69   2.     Nothing in this Agreement shall prevent a Party from adopting or maintaining measures under which it accords more favourable treatment to persons of a non-Party than that accorded to persons of the other Party to this Agreement as a result of a bilateral double taxation avoidance agreement between the Party and such non-Party.    ARTICLE 7.22: SECURITY EXCEPTIONS   1.
