1.  The Parties shall promptly publish or otherwise make publicly available their 
laws,  regulations,  administrative  procedures  and  administrative  rulings  of  general 
application on respective customs matters that pertain to or affect the operation of this

ARTICLE 4.3: RISK MANAGEMENT

on  its  identified  risk  of  goods  in  order  to  facilitate  the  clearance  of  low  risk

methods will significantly enhance the efficiency of trade through reduction of cost and 
time,  the  Parties  shall  co-operate  with  a  view  to  realising  and  promoting  paperless 
trading  between  their  respective  customs  administrations  and  its  respective  trading

ARTICLE 4.5: DENIAL OF PREFERENTIAL TARIFF TREATMENT 
 
1.  The importing Party may deny preferential tariff treatment to a good for which an 
importer in its territory claims preferential tariff treatment where the good does not meet 
the requirements of Chapter 3 or where the importer fails to comply with any of the 
relevant requirements of Chapter 3. 
 
2.  Where the denial of preferential treatment is due to the signature that appears in 
the Certificate of Origin, the Importing Party may accept a clarification letter from the 
exporting Party confirming the authenticity of Certificate of Origin.  Such clarification 
letter may be issued directly from the exporting Party to the importing Party or through 
the exporter of the good. 
 
3.  Export of consignments accompanied by an authentic Certificate of Origin will 
not be subjected to any detention or delays by the Customs Authorities of the importing 
country. 
 
4.  In case of reasonable doubt about the authenticity of a Certificate of Origin, the 
Customs Authority of the importing country may seek a clarification from the certifying 
agency of the exporting country which will furnish the same within a period of 30 days.  
Meanwhile, the subject consignment will be allowed entry into the importing country on 
a provisional basis against a bond or a guarantee i.e. a legally binding undertaking as 
may  be  required.    After  examining  the  information  so  provided  by  the  certifying 
authority, the Customs Authority in the importing country would take appropriate action 
to finalise the provisional assessment. 
 
5.  Where the clarification carried on in paragraph 4 is not conclusive, the importing 
Party may, upon informing the exporting Party and with the knowledge of the importer 
concerned and with the consent of the exporter or manufacturer concerned, visit the 
exporter or manufacturer concerned for the purpose of verifying the preference claim.  If 
no consent is given by the exporter or manufacturer concerned within a period of 45 
days, the importing party may disallow the tariff preference for the particular Certificate 
of Origin.

administration of the importing Party shall return the certificate of origin, or a copy of 
the document, to the customs authority of the exporting Party, giving the reason for the 
enquiry. Any document and/or information obtained suggesting that the information 
given on the certificate of origin is incorrect shall be forwarded in support of the request 
for verification. 
  26  
 
 
3.  The verification shall be carried out by the customs authorities of the exporting 
Party. 
 
 
ARTICLE 4.7: ADVANCE RULINGS
