1. 
Within the meaning of paragraph (b) of Article 3.2 and subject to the provisions 
of Articles 3.6, 3.9 and that the final process of manufacturing is performed within the 
territory of the exporting Party, products would be considered as originating if:  
 
(a) 
(i) 
the total value of the materials, parts or produce originating from 
countries other than the Parties or of undetermined origin used in 
the manufacture of the product does not exceed 60% of the FOB 
value of the product so produced or obtained; and, 
 
(ii)

the four digit level, of the Harmonised System different from those 
in which all the non-originating materials used in its manufacture 
are classified; or  
 
(b) 
the product satisfies the Product Specific Rules as specified in Annex 3B. 
 
2. 
For the purposes of calculating the local value added content, either of the 
following methods can be applied:

materials3-4 
FOB Price 
 
 
x 100 % � 60% 
 
3. 
For the purpose of paragraph 2, if the material does not satisfy the requirements 
of paragraph 1, the non-qualifying value of the materials shall be that proportion which 
cannot be attributed to one or both of the Parties, provided that the requirements of 
Article 3.6 at each stage of value accumulation are satisfied. 
 
 
ARTICLE 3.5: INDIRECT MATERIALS 
 
In order to determine whether a product originates in the territory of a Party, any 
indirect material used to obtain such products shall be treated as originating whether such 
material originates in third countries or not, and its value shall be the cost registered in 
the accounting records of the producer of the good.

ARTICLE 3.8: DETERMINATION OF ORIGIN 
 
No product shall be deemed to be a produce or manufacture of either Party unless 
the conditions specified in these rules are complied with in relation to such products, to 
the satisfaction of the authority issuing the certificate of origin. 
 
 
ARTICLE 3.9: ACCUMULATION 
 
1. 
A product manufactured in one Party and used in the territory of the other Party 
as a material for the finished product shall be considered as a product originating in the

complies with the origin requirements provided for in Articles 3.3 or 3.4; 
and  
 
(b) 
fulfils the criteria in Article 3.6. 
 
2. 
The origin of the finished product would be determined under Article 3.4. 
 
 
ARTICLE 3.10: ACCESSORIES, SPARE PARTS AND TOOLS 
 
Each Party shall provide that accessories, spare parts and tools delivered with a 
good that form part of the good's standard accessories, spare parts and tools, shall be 
treated as originating goods if the good is an originating good, and shall be disregarded 
in determining whether all the non-originating materials used in the production of the 
good undergo the applicable change in tariff classification, provided that: 
 
(a) 
the accessories, spare parts and tools  are not invoiced separately from the 
good; 
(b) 
the quantities and value of the accessories, spare parts and  tools  are  
standard trade practice for the good in the domestic market of the 
exporting Party; and 
(c) 
 if the good is subject to a qualifying value content requirement, the value 
of the accessories, spare parts, or tools shall be taken into account as 
originating or non-originating materials, as the case may be, in calculating 
the qualifying value content of the good. 
 
 
ARTICLE 3.11: TREATMENT OF PACKING 
 
(a) 
Packages and packing materials for retail sale: 
 
 
21 
 
 
(i) 
Packages and packing materials for retail sale, when classified

5(b) of the Harmonised System, shall not be taken into account for 
considering whether all non-originating materials used in the 
manufacture of a product fulfil the criterion corresponding to a 
change of tariff classification of the said product. 
 
(ii) 
If the product is subject to an ad valorem percentage criterion, the 
value of the packages and packing materials for retail sale shall be 
taken into account in its origin assessment, in case they are treated 
as being one for customs purposes with the products in question. 
 
(b) 
Containers and packing materials for transport: 
 
The containers and packing materials exclusively used for the transport of 
a product shall not be taken into account for determining the origin of any 
product, in accordance with General Rule 5(b) of the Harmonised System. 
 
 
ARTICLE 3.12: IDENTICAL AND INTERCHANGEABLE MATERIALS 
  
1. 
Where identical and interchangeable originating and non-originating materials 
including materials of undetermined origin are used in the manufacture of a product, 
those materials shall be physically segregated, according to their origin, during storage. 
 
2. 
A producer facing considerable costs or material difficulties in keeping separate 
stocks of identical and interchangeable originating and non-originating materials 
including materials of undetermined origin used in the manufacture of a product, may 
use the so-called “accounting segregation” method for managing stocks. 
 
3. 
The accounting method shall be recorded, applied and maintained in accordance 
with generally accepted accounting principles applicable in the Party in which the 
product is manufactured. The method chosen must: 
 
(a) 
permit a clear distinction to be made between originating and non 
originating materials including materials of undetermined origin acquired 
and/or kept in stock; and  
 
(b) 
guarantee that no more products receive originating status than would be 
the case if the materials had been physically segregated. 
 
4. 
The producer using this facilitation shall only complete origin declarations for the 
quantity of products considered as originating and shall assume full responsibility for the 
origin declarations and for keeping all documentary evidence of origin of the materials. 
At the request of the competent authorities of the exporting Party, the producer shall 
provide satisfactory information on how the stocks have been managed. 
 
5. 
A Party may require that the application of the method for managing stocks as 
provided for in this Article is subject to prior authorisation. 
 
 
22 
 
 
ARTICLE 3.13: ADVANCE RULINGS  
 
1. 
Each Party shall provide for the issuance of written advance rulings, prior to the 
importation of a good into its territory, to an importer of the good in its territory or to an 
exporter or producer of the good in the exporting party, as to whether the good qualifies 
as an originating good. The importing Party may request, at any time during the course 
of evaluating the request for an advance ruling, additional information necessary to 
evaluate the request. The importing party shall issue its determination regarding the 
origin of the good within 120 days after receipt of all necessary information. 
 
2. 
The importing Party shall apply an advance ruling to importation into its territory 
of the good for which the ruling was issued, for such period, which may be specified in 
the ruling. 
 
3. 
The importing Party may modify or revoke an advance ruling: 
 
(a) 
if the ruling was based on an error of fact; 
 
(b) 
if there is a change in the material facts or circumstances on which the  
ruling was based; or 
 
(c)  
to conform with a modification of this Chapter. 
 
4. 
Where the importing Party modifies or revokes an advance ruling, such 
modification or revocation shall only take effect 60 days after the date on which the 
modification or revocation is issued, and shall not apply to importation of a good that has 
occurred prior to the effective date. 
 
5. 
Notwithstanding paragraphs 3 and 4 above, the importing Party may revoke any 
advance ruling ab initio, if the importer or exporter to whom the advance ruling was 
issued had provided false or incorrect information pursuant to the application for the 
ruling.    
 
6. 
Apart from the advance ruling being revoked ab initio, the person who had 
provided the false or incorrect information shall also be liable to appropriate penalties 
under the domestic laws of the respective Parties. 
 
 
ARTICLE 3.14: CONSIGNMENT CRITERIA 
 
The originating goods of the other Party shall be deemed to meet the consignment 
criteria when they are: 
 
(a) 
transported directly from the territory of the other Party; or 
 
(b) 
transported through the territory or territories of one or more non-Parties 
for the purpose of transit or temporary storing in warehouses in such 
territory or territories, and the products have not entered into trade or 
consumption there, provided that  
 
 
23 
 
 
(i) 
they do not undergo operations other than unloading, reloading or 
operations to preserve them in good condition; or 
 
(ii) 
the transit entry is justified for geographical reason or by 
considerations related exclusively to transport requirements. 
 
 
SECTION C: DOCUMENTATION REQUIREMENTS 
 
ARTICLE 3.15: CERTIFICATE OF ORIGIN 
 
Products eligible for preferential concessions shall be supported by a Certificate 
of Origin issued by a government authority designated by the government of the 
exporting Party and notified to the other Party (referred to herein as “the certifying 
authority”) in accordance with the Operational Certification Procedures, as set out in 
Annex 3B.  
 
 
SECTION D : VERIFICATION OF ORIGIN 
 
ARTICLE 3.16: CO-OPERATION ON VERIFICATION OF CERTIFICATES OF ORIGIN 
 
1. 
The Parties shall co-operate with each other to verify the authenticity and the 
correctness of the information given in the certificates of origin.  
 
2. 
For the purpose of implementing the provisions of paragraph 1, the customs 
administration of the importing Party shall return the certificate of origin, or a copy of 
the document, to the certifying authority of the exporting Party, giving the reason for the 
enquiry. Any document and/or information obtained suggesting that the information 
given on the certificate of origin is incorrect shall be forwarded in support of the request 
for verification. 
 
3. 
The verification shall be carried out by the certifying authority of the exporting 
Party.  
 
 
ARTICLE 3.17: DENIAL OF PREFERENTIAL TARIFF TREATMENT 
 
1. 
Export of consignments accompanied by an authentic Certificate of Origin will 
not be subjected to any detention or delays by the Customs Authorities of the importing 
country. 
 
2. 
In case of reasonable doubt about the authenticity of Certificate of Origin, the 
Customs authority of the importing country may seek a clarification from the certifying 
authority of the exporting country, which will furnish the same within a period of 30 
days.  Meanwhile, the subject consignment will be allowed entry into the importing 
country on a provisional basis against a bond or a guarantee i.e. a legally binding 
undertaking as may be required.  After examining the information so provided by the 
 
 
24 
 
certifying authority, the Customs Authority in the importing country would take 
appropriate action to finalise the provisional assessment. 
 
3. 
Where the clarification carried on in above paragraph 2 is not conclusive, the 
importing Party may, upon informing the exporting Party and with the knowledge of the 
importer concerned and with the consent of the exporter or manufacturer concerned, visit 
the exporter or manufacturer concerned for the purpose of verifying the preference claim.  
If no consent is given by the exporter or manufacturer concerned within a period of 45 
days, the importing party may disallow the tariff preference for the particular Certificate 
of Origin.  
 
 
SECTION E : CONSULTATION AND MODIFICATIONS 
 
ARTICLE 3.18: CONSULTATION AND MODIFICATIONS 
 
These rules may be reviewed as and when necessary upon the request of either 
Party and may be modified by mutual agreement pursuant to Article 16.7.
