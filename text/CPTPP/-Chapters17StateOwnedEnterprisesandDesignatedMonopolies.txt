Nothing in this Chapter shall prevent a central bank or monetary authority of a Party from performing regulatory or supervisory activities or conducting monetary and related credit policy and exchange rate policy.  3. Nothing in this Chapter shall prevent a financial regulatory body of a Party, including a non-governmental body, such as a securities or futures exchange or market, clearing agency, or other organisation or association, from exercising regulatory or supervisory authority over financial services suppliers.  4. Nothing in this Chapter shall prevent a Party, or one of its state enterprises or state-owned enterprises from undertaking activities for the purpose of the resolution of a failing or failed financial institution or any other failing or failed enterprise principally engaged in the supply of financial services.  5. This Chapter shall not apply with respect to a sovereign wealth fund of a Party10, except:                                                   8  For the purposes of this Chapter, the terms “financial service supplier”, “financial institution” and “financial services” have the same meaning as in Article 11.1 (Definitions).  9  This Chapter also applies with respect to the activities of state-owned enterprises of a Party that cause adverse effects in the market of a non-Party as provided in Article 17.7 (Adverse Effects).  10  Malaysia shall not be subject to dispute settlement under Chapter 28 (Dispute Settlement) with respect to enterprises owned or controlled by Khazanah Nasional Berhad for a period of two years following the entry into force of this Agreement for Malaysia, in light of ongoing development of state-owned enterprise reform legislation.   17-5 (a) Article 17.6.1 and Article 17.6.3 (Non-commercial Assistance) shall apply with respect to a Party’s indirect provision of non-commercial assistance through a sovereign wealth fund; and  (b) Article 17.6.2 (Non-commercial Assistance) shall apply with respect to a sovereign wealth fund’s provision of non-commercial assistance.  6.

Nothing in this Chapter shall prevent a state-owned enterprise of a Party from providing goods or services exclusively to that Party for the purposes of carrying out that Party’s governmental functions.  9. Nothing in this Chapter shall be construed to prevent a Party from:  (a) establishing or maintaining a state enterprise or a state-owned enterprise; or  (b) designating a monopoly.  10. Article 17.4 (Non-discriminatory Treatment and Commercial Considerations), Article 17.6 (Non-commercial Assistance) and Article 17.10 (Transparency) shall not apply to any service supplied in the exercise of governmental authority.11  11.

Article 17.3:  Delegated Authority  Each Party shall ensure that when its state-owned enterprises, state enterprises and designated monopolies exercise any regulatory, administrative or other governmental authority that the Party has directed or delegated to such entities to carry out, those entities act in a manner that is not inconsistent with that Party’s obligations under this Agreement.12   Article 17.4:  Non-discriminatory Treatment and Commercial Considerations  1.  Each Party shall ensure that each of its state-owned enterprises, when engaging in commercial activities:  (a)  acts in accordance with commercial considerations in its purchase or sale of a good or service, except to fulfil any terms of its public service mandate that are not inconsistent with subparagraph (c)(ii);  (b)  in its purchase of a good or service:  (i) accords to a good or service supplied by an enterprise of another Party treatment no less favourable than it accords to a like good or a like service supplied by enterprises of the Party, of any other Party or of any non-Party; and  (ii)  accords to a good or service supplied by an enterprise that is a covered investment in the Party’s territory treatment no less favourable than it accords to a like good or a like service supplied by enterprises in the relevant market in the Party’s territory that are investments of investors of the Party, of any other Party or of any non-Party; and   (c) in its sale of a good or service:                                                    12  Examples of regulatory, administrative or other governmental authority include the power to expropriate, grant licences, approve commercial transactions, or impose quotas, fees or other charges.   17-7 (i)  accords to an enterprise of another Party treatment no less favourable than it accords to enterprises of the Party, of any other Party or of any non-Party; and  (ii) accords to an enterprise that is a covered investment in the Party’s territory treatment no less favourable than it accords to enterprises in the relevant market in the Party’s territory that are investments of investors of the Party, of any other Party or of any non-Party.13  2. Each Party shall ensure that each of its designated monopolies:  (a)  acts in accordance with commercial considerations in its purchase or sale of the monopoly good or service in the relevant market, except to fulfil any terms of its designation that are not inconsistent with subparagraph (b), (c) or (d);   (b)  in its purchase of the monopoly good or service:  (i)  accords to a good or service supplied by an enterprise of another Party treatment no less favourable than it accords to a like good or a like service supplied by enterprises of the Party, of any other Party or of any non-Party; and  (ii)  accords to a good or service supplied by an enterprise that is a covered investment in the Party’s territory treatment no less favourable than it accords to a like good or a like service supplied by enterprises in the relevant market in the Party’s territory that are investments of investors of the Party, of any other Party or of any non-Party; and  (c) in its sale of the monopoly good or service:  (i)  accords to an enterprise of another Party treatment no less favourable than it accords to enterprises of the Party, of any other Party or of any non-Party; and  (ii)  accords to an enterprise that is a covered investment in the Party’s territory treatment no less favourable than it accords to enterprises in the relevant market in the Party’s territory that are investments of investors of the Party, of any other Party or of any non-Party; and  (d)  does not use its monopoly position to engage in, either directly or indirectly, including through its dealings with its parent, subsidiaries or other entities the Party or the designated monopoly owns,                                                  13  Article 17.4.1 (Non-discriminatory Treatment and Commercial Considerations) shall not apply with respect to the purchase or sale of shares, stock or other forms of equity by a state-owned enterprise as a means of its equity participation in another enterprise.    17-8 anticompetitive practices in a non-monopolised market in its territory that negatively affect trade or investment between the Parties.14  3.  Paragraphs 1(b) and 1(c) and paragraphs 2(b) and 2(c) do not preclude a state-owned enterprise or designated monopoly from:  (a) purchasing or selling goods or services on different terms or conditions including those relating to price; or  (b) refusing to purchase or sell goods or services,  provided that such differential treatment or refusal is undertaken in accordance with commercial considerations.   Article 17.5:  Courts and Administrative Bodies  1. Each Party shall provide its courts with jurisdiction over civil claims against an enterprise owned or controlled through ownership interests by a foreign government based on a commercial activity carried on in its territory.15 This shall not be construed to require a Party to provide jurisdiction over such claims if it does not provide jurisdiction over similar claims against enterprises that are not owned or controlled through ownership interests by a foreign government.  2. Each Party shall ensure that any administrative body that the Party establishes or maintains that regulates a state-owned enterprise exercises its regulatory discretion in an impartial manner with respect to enterprises that it regulates, including enterprises that are not state-owned enterprises.16                                                    14  For greater certainty, a Party may comply with the requirements of this subparagraph through the enforcement or implementation of its generally applicable national competition laws and regulations, its economic regulatory laws and regulations, or other appropriate measures.  15  This paragraph shall not be construed to preclude a Party from providing its courts with jurisdiction over claims against enterprises owned or controlled through ownership interests by a foreign government other than those claims referred to in this paragraph.  16  For greater certainty, the impartiality with which an administrative body exercises its regulatory discretion is to be assessed by reference to a pattern or practice of that administrative body.    17-9 Article 17.6:  Non-commercial Assistance   1.  No Party shall cause17 adverse effects to the interests of another Party through the use of non-commercial assistance that it provides, either directly or indirectly18, to any of its state-owned enterprises with respect to:  (a)  the production and sale of a good by the state-owned enterprise;  (b) the supply of a service by the state-owned enterprise from the territory of the Party into the territory of another Party; or  (c) the supply of a service in the territory of another Party through an enterprise that is a covered investment in the territory of that other Party or any other Party.  2. Each Party shall ensure that its state enterprises and state-owned enterprises do not cause adverse effects to the interests of another Party through the use of non-commercial assistance that the state enterprise or state-owned enterprise provides to any of its state-owned enterprises with respect to:  (a) the production and sale of a good by the state-owned enterprise;  (b)  the supply of a service by the state-owned enterprise from the territory of the Party into the territory of another Party; or  (c) the supply of a service in the territory of another Party through an enterprise that is a covered investment in the territory of that other Party or any other Party.  3. No Party shall cause injury to a domestic industry19 of another Party through the use of non-commercial assistance that it provides, either directly or indirectly, to any of its state-owned enterprises that is a covered investment in the territory of that other Party in circumstances where:  (a)  the non-commercial assistance is provided with respect to the production and sale of a good by the state-owned enterprise in the territory of the other Party; and                                                   17  For the purposes of paragraphs 1 and 2, it must be demonstrated that the adverse effects claimed have been caused by the non-commercial assistance.  Thus, the non-commercial assistance must be examined within the context of other possible causal factors to ensure an appropriate attribution of causality.   18  For greater certainty, indirect provision includes the situation in which a Party entrusts or directs an enterprise that is not a state-owned enterprise to provide non-commercial assistance.    19  The term “domestic industry” refers to the domestic producers as a whole of the like good, or to those domestic producers whose collective output of the like good constitutes a major proportion of the total domestic production of the like good, excluding the state-owned enterprise that is a covered investment that has received the non-commercial assistance referred to in this paragraph.    17-10 (b)  a like good is produced and sold in the territory of the other Party by the domestic industry of that other Party.20  4. A service supplied by a state-owned enterprise of a Party within that Party’s territory shall be deemed not to cause adverse effects.21   Article 17.7:  Adverse Effects  1.  For the purposes of Article 17.6.1 and Article 17.6.2 (Non-commercial Assistance), adverse effects arise if the effect of the non-commercial assistance is:  (a)  that the production and sale of a good by a Party’s state-owned enterprise that has received the non-commercial assistance displaces or impedes from the Party’s market imports of a like good of another Party or sales of a like good produced by an enterprise that is a covered investment in the territory of the Party;  (b)  that the production and sale of a good by a Party’s state-owned enterprise that has received the non-commercial assistance displaces or impedes from:  (i) the market of another Party sales of a like good produced by an enterprise that is a covered investment in the territory of that other Party, or imports of a like good of any other Party; or  (ii) the market of a non-Party imports of a like good of another Party;  (c) a significant price undercutting by a good produced by a Party’s state-owned enterprise that has received the non-commercial assistance and sold by the enterprise in:  (i) the market of a Party as compared with the price in the same market of imports of a like good of another Party or a like good that is produced by an enterprise that is a covered investment in the territory of the Party, or significant price suppression, price depression or lost sales in the same market; or  (ii) the market of a non-Party as compared with the price in the same market of imports of a like good of another Party, or significant price suppression, price depression or lost sales in the same market;                                                   20  In situations of material retardation of the establishment of a domestic industry, it is understood that a domestic industry may not yet produce and sell the like good.  However, in these situations, there must be evidence that a prospective domestic producer has made a substantial commitment to commence production and sales of the like good.  21  For greater certainty, this paragraph shall not be construed to apply to a service that itself is a form of non-commercial assistance.   17-11 (d)  that services supplied by a Party's state-owned enterprise that has received the non-commercial assistance displace or impede from the market of another Party a like service supplied by a service supplier of that other Party or any other Party; or  (e) a significant price undercutting by a service supplied in the market of another Party by a Party’s state-owned enterprise that has received the non-commercial assistance as compared with the price in the same market of a like service supplied by a service supplier of that other Party or any other Party, or significant price suppression, price depression or lost sales in the same market.22   2. For the purposes of paragraphs 1(a), 1(b) and 1(d), the displacing or impeding of a good or service includes any case in which it has been demonstrated that there has been a significant change in relative shares of the market to the disadvantage of the like good or like service.  “Significant change in relative shares of the market” shall include any of the following situations:  (a)  there is a significant increase in the market share of the good or service of the Party’s state-owned enterprise;  (b)  the market share of the good or service of the Party’s state-owned enterprise remains constant in circumstances in which, in the absence of the non-commercial assistance, it would have declined significantly; or  (c)  the market share of the good or service of the Party’s state-owned enterprise declines, but at a significantly slower rate than would have been the case in the absence of the non-commercial assistance.  The change must manifest itself over an appropriately representative period sufficient to demonstrate clear trends in the development of the market for the good or service concerned, which, in normal circumstances, shall be at least one year.  3. For the purposes of paragraphs 1(c) and 1(e), price undercutting shall include any case in which such price undercutting has been demonstrated through a comparison of the prices of the good or service of the state-owned enterprise with the prices of the like good or service.  4. Comparisons of the prices in paragraph 3 shall be made at the same level of trade and at comparable times, and due account shall be taken for factors affecting price comparability. If a direct comparison of transactions is not possible, the existence of price undercutting may be demonstrated on some other reasonable basis, such as, in the case of goods, a comparison of unit values.  5. Non-commercial assistance that a Party provides:  (a)  before the signing of this Agreement; or                                                   22  The purchase or sale of shares, stock or other forms of equity by a state-owned enterprise that has received non-commercial assistance as a means of its equity participation in another enterprise shall not be construed to give rise to adverse effects as provided for in Article 17.7.1 (Adverse Effects).   17-12  (b)  within three years after the signing of this Agreement, pursuant to a law that is enacted, or contractual obligation undertaken, prior to the signing of this Agreement,   shall be deemed not to cause adverse effects.  6. For the purposes of Article 17.6.1(b) and Article 17.6.2(b) (Non-commercial Assistance), the initial capitalisation of a state-owned enterprise, or the acquisition by a Party of a controlling interest in an enterprise, that is principally engaged in the supply of services within the territory of the Party, shall be deemed not to cause adverse effects.    Article 17.8:  Injury  1. For the purposes of Article 17.6.3 (Non-commercial Assistance), the term “injury” shall be taken to mean material injury to a domestic industry, threat of material injury to a domestic industry or material retardation of the establishment of such an industry. A determination of material injury shall be based on positive evidence and involve an objective examination of the relevant factors, including the volume of production by the covered investment that has received non-commercial assistance, the effect of such production on prices for like goods produced and sold by the domestic industry, and the effect of such production on the domestic industry producing like goods.23  2. With regard to the volume of production by the covered investment that has received non-commercial assistance, consideration shall be given as to whether there has been a significant increase in the volume of production, either in absolute terms or relative to production or consumption in the territory of the Party in which injury is alleged to have occurred. With regard to the effect of the production by the covered investment on prices, consideration shall be given as to whether there has been a significant price undercutting by the goods produced and sold by the covered investment as compared with the price of like goods produced and sold by the domestic industry, or whether the effect of production by the covered investment is otherwise to depress prices to a significant degree or to prevent price increases, which otherwise would have occurred, to a significant degree. No one or several of these factors can necessarily give decisive guidance.  3. The examination of the impact on the domestic industry of the goods produced and sold by the covered investment that received the non-commercial assistance shall include an evaluation of all relevant economic factors and indices having a bearing on the state of the industry, such as actual and potential decline in output, sales, market share, profits, productivity, return on investments, or utilisation of capacity; factors affecting domestic prices; actual and potential negative effects on cash flow, inventories, employment, wages, growth, ability to raise capital or investments and, in the case of agriculture, whether there has been an increased burden on government                                                  23  The periods for examination of the non-commercial assistance and injury shall be reasonably established and shall end as closely as practical to the date of initiation of the proceeding before the panel.      17-13 support programmes.  This list is not exhaustive, nor can one or several of these factors necessarily give decisive guidance.  4. It must be demonstrated that the goods produced and sold by the covered investment are, through the effects24 of the non-commercial assistance, causing injury within the meaning of this Article. The demonstration of a causal relationship between the goods produced and sold by the covered investment and the injury to the domestic industry shall be based on an examination of all relevant evidence. Any known factors other than the goods produced by the covered investment which at the same time are injuring the domestic industry shall be examined, and the injuries caused by these other factors must not be attributed to the goods produced and sold by the covered investment that has received non-commercial assistance. Factors which may be relevant in this respect include, among other things, the volumes and prices of other like goods in the market in question, contraction in demand or changes in the patterns of consumption, and developments in technology and the export performance and productivity of the domestic industry.  5. A determination of a threat of material injury shall be based on facts and not merely on allegation, conjecture or remote possibility and shall be considered with special care. The change in circumstances which would create a situation in which non-commercial assistance to the covered investment would cause injury must be clearly foreseen and imminent. In making a determination regarding the existence of a threat of material injury, there should be consideration of relevant factors25 and of whether the totality of the factors considered lead to the conclusion that further availability of goods produced by the covered investment is imminent and that, unless protective action is taken, material injury would occur.                                                  24  As set out in paragraphs 2 and 3.  25  In making a determination regarding the existence of a threat of material injury, a panel pursuant to Chapter 28 (Dispute Settlement) should consider, among other things, such factors as: (a) the nature of the non-commercial assistance in question and the trade effects likely to arise therefrom; (b) a significant rate of increase in sales in the domestic market by the covered investment, indicating a likelihood of substantially increased sales; (c) sufficient freely disposable, or an imminent, substantial increase in, capacity of the covered investment indicating the likelihood of substantially increased production of the good by that covered investment, taking into account the availability of export markets to absorb additional production; (d) whether prices of goods sold by the covered investment will have a significant depressing or suppressing effect on the price of like goods; and (e) inventories of like goods.   17-14   Article 17.9:  Party-Specific Annexes  1. Article 17.4 (Non-discriminatory Treatment and Commercial Considerations) and Article 17.6 (Non-commercial Assistance) shall not apply with respect to the non-conforming activities of state-owned enterprises or designated monopolies that a Party lists in its Schedule to Annex IV in accordance with the terms of the Party’s Schedule.  2. Article 17.4 (Non-discriminatory Treatment and Commercial Considerations), Article 17.5 (Courts and Administrative Bodies), Article 17.6 (Non-commercial Assistance) and Article 17.10 (Transparency) shall not apply with respect to a Party’s state-owned enterprises or designated monopolies as set out in Annex 17-D (Application to Sub-Central State-Owned Enterprises and Designated Monopolies).  3.

The first adjustment shall take place on the first 1 January following the entry into force of this Agreement, in accordance with the formula set out in this Annex.  3. The threshold shall be adjusted for changes in general price levels using a composite SDR inflation rate, calculated as a weighted sum of cumulative per cent changes in the Gross Domestic Product (GDP) deflators of SDR component currencies over the three-year period ending 30 June of the year prior to the adjustment taking effect, and using the following formula:  𝑇1 = (1 + (Σ w𝑖𝑆𝐷𝑅 .  Π𝑖𝑆𝐷𝑅))𝑇0  where:   𝑇0     = threshold value at base period; 𝑇1     = new (adjusted) threshold value; w𝑖𝑆𝐷𝑅   = respective (fixed) weights of each currency, 𝑖, in the SDR (as at 30 June of the year prior to adjustment taking effect); and Π𝑖𝑆𝐷𝑅   = cumulative per cent change in the GDP deflator of each currency, 𝑖, in the SDR over the three-year period ending 30 June of the year prior to adjustment taking effect.  4. Each Party shall convert the threshold into national currency terms where the conversion rates shall be the average of monthly values of that Party’s national currency in SDR terms over the three-year period to 30 June of the year before the threshold is to take effect.  Each Party shall notify the other Parties of their applicable threshold in their respective national currencies.  5. For the purposes of this Chapter, all data shall be drawn from the International Monetary Fund’s International Financial Statistics database.  6. The Parties shall consult if a major change in a national currency vis-à-vis the SDR were to create a significant problem with regard to the application of this Chapter.       17-22 ANNEX 17-B   PROCESS FOR DEVELOPING INFORMATION CONCERNING STATE-OWNED ENTERPRISES AND DESIGNATED MONOPOLIES   1. If a panel has been established pursuant to Chapter 28 (Dispute Settlement) to examine a complaint arising under Article 17.4 (Non-discriminatory Treatment and Commercial Considerations) or Article 17.6 (Non-commercial Assistance), the disputing Parties may exchange written questions and responses, as set forth in paragraphs 2, 3 and 4, to obtain information relevant to the complaint that is not otherwise readily available.  2. A disputing Party (questioning Party) may provide written questions to another disputing Party (answering Party) within 15 days of the date the panel is established.  The answering Party shall provide its responses to the questions to the questioning Party within 30 days of the date it receives the questions.  3. The questioning Party may provide any follow-up written questions to the answering Party within 15 days of the date it receives the responses to the initial questions. The answering Party shall provide its responses to the follow-up questions to the questioning Party within 30 days of the date it receives the follow-up questions.  4. If the questioning Party considers that the answering Party has failed to cooperate in the information-gathering process under this Annex, the questioning Party shall inform the panel and the answering Party in writing within 30 days of the date the responses to the questioning Party’s final questions are due, and provide the basis for its view.  The panel shall afford the answering Party an opportunity to reply in writing.  5. A disputing Party that provides written questions or responses to another disputing Party pursuant to these procedures shall, on the same day, provide the questions or answers to the panel.  In the event that a panel has not yet been composed, each disputing Party shall, upon the composition of the panel, promptly provide the panel with any questions or responses it has provided to the other disputing Party.  6. The answering Party may designate information in its responses as confidential information in accordance with the procedures set out in the Rules of Procedure established under Article 27.2.1(f) (Functions of the Commission) or other rules of procedure agreed to by the disputing Parties.  7. The time periods in paragraphs 2, 3 and 4 may be modified upon agreement of the disputing Parties or approval by the panel.  8. In determining whether a disputing Party has failed to cooperate in the information-gathering process, the panel shall take into account the reasonableness of the questions and the efforts the answering Party has made to respond to the questions in a cooperative and timely manner.    17-23 9. In making findings of fact and its initial report, the panel should draw adverse inferences from instances of non-cooperation by a disputing Party in the information-gathering process.  10. The panel may deviate from the time period set out in Chapter 28 (Dispute Settlement) for the issuance of the initial report if necessary to accommodate the information-gathering process.  11. The panel may seek additional information from a disputing Party that was not provided to the panel through the information-gathering process where the panel considers the information necessary to resolve the dispute.  However, the panel shall not request additional information to complete the record where the information would support a Party’s position and the absence of that information in the record is the result of that Party’s non-cooperation in the information-gathering process.     17-24   ANNEX 17-C   FURTHER NEGOTIATIONS   Within five years of the date of entry into force of this Agreement, the Parties shall conduct further negotiations on extending the application of:  (a) the disciplines in this Chapter to the activities of state-owned enterprises that are owned or controlled by a sub-central level of government, and designated monopolies designated by a sub-central level of government, where such activities have been listed in Annex 17-D (Application to Sub-Central State-Owned Enterprises and Designated Monopolies); and  (b) the disciplines in Article 17.6 (Non-commercial Assistance) and Article 17.7 (Adverse Effects) to address effects caused, in a market of a non-Party, by the supply of services by a state-owned enterprise.     17-25   ANNEX 17-D  APPLICATION TO SUB-CENTRAL  STATE-OWNED ENTERPRISES AND DESIGNATED MONOPOLIES    Pursuant to Article 17.9.2 (Party-Specific Annexes), the following obligations shall not apply with respect to a state-owned enterprise owned or controlled by a sub-central level of government and a designated monopoly designated by a sub-central level of government:36  (a) For Australia:  (i) Article 17.4.1(a) and (b) (Non-discriminatory Treatment and Commercial Considerations);  (ii) Article 17.4.2 (Non-discriminatory Treatment and Commercial Considerations);  (iii) Article 17.6.1(a) (Non-commercial Assistance) and Article 17.6.2(a) (Non-commercial Assistance), with respect to the production and sale of a good in competition with a like good produced and sold by a covered investment in the territory of Australia;  (iv) Article 17.6.1(b) and (c) (Non-commercial Assistance), and Article 17.6.2(b) and (c) (Non-commercial Assistance); and  (v) Article 17.10.1 (Transparency).
