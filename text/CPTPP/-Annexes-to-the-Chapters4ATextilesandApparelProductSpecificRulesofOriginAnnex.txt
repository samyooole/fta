TEXTILES AND APPAREL PRODUCT-SPECIFIC RULES OF ORIGIN 
 
 
Section A: General Interpretative Notes 
 
1.  For the purposes of interpreting the product-specific rules of origin set out in 
this Annex, the following definitions shall apply: 
 
section means a section of the Harmonized System; 
 
chapter means a chapter of the Harmonized System; 
 
heading means the first four digits of the tariff classification number under the 
Harmonized System; and 
 
subheading means the first six digits of the tariff classification number under the 
Harmonized System. 
 
2.  Under this Annex, a good is an originating good if it is produced entirely in the 
territory of one or more of the Parties by one or more producers using non-originating 
materials, and: 
 
(a)  each of the non-originating materials used in the production of the good 
satisfies any applicable change in tariff classification requirement, or 
the good otherwise satisfies the production process requirement or any 
other requirement specified in this Annex; and 
 
(b)  the good satisfies all other applicable requirements of Chapter 3 (Rules 
of Origin and Origin Procedures) or Chapter 4 (Textile and Apparel 
Goods). 
 
3.  For the purposes of interpreting the product-specific rules of origin set out in 
this Annex: 
 
(a)  the specific rule, or specific set of rules, that applies to a particular 
heading, subheading or group of headings or subheadings is set out 
immediately adjacent to the heading, subheading or group of headings 
or subheadings; 
 
 
 
 
ANNEX 4-A – 1  
 
 
 
 
(b)  chapter or heading notes, where applicable, are found at the beginning 
of each chapter, and are read in conjunction with the product-specific 
rules of origin and may impose further conditions on, or provide an 
alternative to the product-specific rules of origin; 
 
(c)  the requirement of a change in tariff classification shall apply only to 
non-originating materials; 
 
(d)  if a product-specific rule of origin excludes certain materials of the 
Harmonized System, it shall be construed to mean that the product-
specific  rule  of  origin  requires  that  the  excluded  materials  be 
originating for the good to be originating; 
 
(e)  if a good is subject to a product-specific rule of origin that includes 
multiple requirements, the good shall be originating only if it satisfies 
all of the requirements; 
 
(f)  if a single product-specific rule of origin applies to a group of headings 
or subheadings and that rule of origin specifies a change of heading or 
subheading,  it  shall  be  understood  that  the  change  in  heading  or 
subheading may occur from any other heading or subheading, as the 
case may be, including from any other heading or subheading within 
the group; and 
 
(g)  the Short Supply List of Products, set out as Appendix 1 to this Annex, 
is read in conjunction with the product-specific rules of origin set out in 
this Annex.
