The Nation has the direct, inalienable and imprescriptible 
ownership of all hydrocarbons in the subsoil of the national 
territory, including the continental shelf and the exclusive 
economic zone located outside the territorial sea and adjacent 
thereto, in strata or deposits, regardless of their physical 
conditions.  Only the Nation shall conduct the exploration and 
production of hydrocarbons, through entitlements or contracts. 
The exploration and production contracts shall invariably 
stipulate that the hydrocarbons in the subsoil are property of the 
Nation. 
 
The Ministry of Energy (Secretaría de Energía) shall establish 
the appropriate contract model for each contractual area that 
undergoes a bidding process and is awarded according to the 
laws; for which it may choose among other contracting models: 
services, profit-sharing, production-sharing or licenses. 
 
The exploration and production activities of hydrocarbons 
conducted in the national territory through entitlements and 
exploration and production contracts must comply with a 
minimum national content percentage goal on average.  This 
national content average goal will not take into account 
exploration and production of hydrocarbons in deep-water and 
ultra-deep water, which will have a different national content 
requirement established by the Ministry of Economy 
(Secretaría de Economía, SE) with the opinion of the Ministry 
of Energy considering the characteristics of those activities.   
 
The above mentioned mandate must comply with the 
methodology established by the Ministry of Economy, and 
must consider that it does not affect the competitive position of 
the Petróleos Mexicanos (PEMEX) or any other state 
productive enterprises and other economic agents developing 
exploration and production of hydrocarbons.  
 
The Federal Executive shall establish safeguard zones in the 
areas in which the State decides to prohibit exploration and 
production activities, different from protected natural areas in 
which entitlements and contracts cannot be awarded.  
 
The Mexican Government should include within the conditions 
ANNEX I – MEXICO – 18  
for the entitlements and exploration and production contracts, 
as well as in the permits, that under the same circumstances of 
prices, quality and timely delivery, preference should be given 
to the purchase of national goods and the contracting of 
domestic services, including the training and hiring, at a 
technical and management level, of Mexican nationals. 
 
The Ministry of Energy and the Energy Regulatory 
Commission (Comisión Reguladora de Energía, CRE) will 
establish the permit models for the transportation, treatment, 
refining, processing, storage, distribution, compression, 
liquefaction, decompression, regasification, sale to the public 
and commercialisation of hydrocarbons, petroleum products 
and petrochemicals, taking into account that permit-holders 
must have an address in Mexico.  The permits for the exporting 
and importing of hydrocarbons and petroleum products will be 
issued according to the Foreign Trade Law, which requires 
permit-holders to have a domicile in Mexico.

The Nation has the direct, inalienable and imprescriptible 
ownership of all hydrocarbons in the subsoil of the national 
territory, including the continental shelf and the exclusive 
economic zone located outside the territorial sea and adjacent 
ANNEX I – MEXICO – 20  
thereto, in strata or deposits, regardless of their physical 
conditions.  Only the Nation shall conduct the exploration and 
production of hydrocarbons, through entitlements or contracts, 
which must invariably stipulate that the hydrocarbons in the 
subsoil are property of the Nation. 
 
The Ministry of Energy (Secretaría de Energía), with technical 
assistance from the National Hydrocarbons Commission 
(Comisión Nacional de Hidrocarburos), might award entitlements 
to Petróleos Mexicanos (PEMEX), as a state productive 
enterprise, for the exploration and production of hydrocarbons. In 
that regard, PEMEX may only transfer an entitlement to another 
state productive enterprise. 
 
In order to perform the activities related to the entitlements, 
PEMEX shall only execute service contracts with private parties. 
 
The State may mandate PEMEX through its entitlements, 
exploration and production contracts, and permits, to include 
preferences for the purchase of national goods, contracting 
domestic services, as well as a preference for nationals, including 
technicians and senior management. 
 
The above mentioned mandate must comply with the 
methodology established by the Ministry of Economy (Secretaría 
de Economía, SE), and consider that it does not affect the 
competitive position of the state productive enterprise and other 
economic agents developing exploration and production of 
hydrocarbons.  
 
The Ministry of Energy (Secretaría de Energía) might establish a 
direct participation for PEMEX, or another state productive 
enterprise, in the contracts for exploration and production of 
hydrocarbons, when the contractual area coexists with an 
entitlement, when there are opportunities to transfer knowledge 
and technology, and when there is the possibility of finding a 
transboundary reservoir. 
 
Until December 31, 2017 PEMEX may be the sole entity in 
charge of the commercialisation of hydrocarbons.  Until 
December 31, 2016 PEMEX will be the only permit-holder for the 
importing and exporting of gasolines and diesel. 
 
The Ministry of Energy (Secretaría de Energía) and the Energy 
Regulatory Commission (Comisión Reguladora de Energía) will 
establish the permit models for the transportation, treatment, 
refining, processing, storage, distribution, compression, 
ANNEX I – MEXICO – 21  
liquefaction, decompression, regasification, sale to the public and 
commercialisation of hydrocarbons, petroleum products and 
petrochemicals, taking into account that permit-holders must have 
an address in Mexico.  The permits for the exporting and 
importing of hydrocarbons and petroleum products will be issued 
according to the Foreign Trade Law, which requires permit-

Description:  Investment and Cross-Border Trade in Services  
 
The operation or exploitation of high-seas navigation vessels, 
including transport and international towing services is open to 
ship-owners and vessels of all countries, on the basis of 
reciprocity according to international treaties.  With the prior 
opinion of the Federal Competition Commission (Comisión 
Federal de Competencia, CFC), the Ministry of 
Communications and Transportation (Secretaría de 
Comunicaciones y Transportes, SCT) may reserve, totally or 
partially, certain international high-seas freight transportation 
services, which could only be carried out by Mexican shipping 
enterprises with Mexican-flagged vessels or vessels reputed as 
such when the principles of free competition are not respected 
or the national economy is affected.  For greater certainty the 
previous sentence does not apply to Canada. 
ANNEX I – MEXICO – 54  
  
The operation and exploitation of cabotage and inland 
navigation is reserved for Mexican ship-owners with Mexican 
vessels.  When Mexican vessels are not appropriate and 
available with the same technical conditions, or it is required by 
the public interest, the SCT may provide temporary navigation 
permits to operate and exploit to Mexican ship-owners with a 
foreign vessel in accordance with the following priorities:  
 
(a)  Mexican ship-owner with a foreign vessel under 
a bareboat charter party; and  
 
(b)  Mexican ship-owner with a foreign vessel under 
any type of charter party. 
 
The operation and exploitation in inland navigation and 
cabotage of tourist cruises as well as dredges and maritime 
devices for the construction, preservation and operation of ports 
may be carried out by Mexican or foreign shipping enterprises 
using Mexican or foreign vessels or maritime devices, on the 
basis of reciprocity with a Party, endeavouring to give priority 
to Mexican enterprises and complying with applicable laws. 
 
With the prior opinion of the CFC, the SCT may resolve that 
totally or partially, certain cabotage or high-seas traffic could 
only be carried by Mexican shipping enterprises with Mexican 
vessels or reputed as such in the absence of conditions of 
effective competition on the relevant market as per the terms of 
the Economic Competition Federal Law. 
 
Investors of another Party or their investments may only own, 
directly or indirectly, up to 49 per cent of the ownership interest 
in a Mexican shipping enterprise or Mexican vessels, 
established or to be established in the territory of Mexico, 
which is engaged in the commercial exploitation of vessels for 
inland and coastal navigation, excluding tourism cruises and 
exploitation of dredges and maritime devices for the 
construction, preservation and operation of ports. 
 
Favourable resolution from the National Commission of 
Foreign Investments (Comisión Nacional de Inversiones

their investments to own, directly or indirectly, more than 49 
per cent of the ownership interest in an enterprise established or
