CHAPTER 16 
 
COMPETITION POLICY 
 
 
Article 16.1:  Competition Law and Authorities and Anticompetitive 
Business Conduct1 
 
1. 
Each Party shall adopt or maintain national competition laws that 
proscribe anticompetitive business conduct, with the objective of promoting 
economic efficiency and consumer welfare, and shall take appropriate action with 
respect to that conduct.  These laws should take into account the APEC Principles 
to Enhance Competition and Regulatory Reform, done at Auckland, September 
13, 1999. 
 
2. 
Each Party shall endeavour to apply its national competition laws to all 
commercial activities in its territory.2  However, each Party may provide for 
certain exemptions from the application of its national competition laws provided 
that those exemptions are transparent and are based on public policy grounds or 
public interest grounds. 
 
3. 
Each Party shall maintain an authority or authorities responsible for the 
enforcement of its national competition laws (national competition authorities).  
Each Party shall provide that it is the enforcement policy of that authority or 
authorities to act in accordance with the objectives set out in paragraph 1 and not 
to discriminate on the basis of nationality.  
 
 
Article 16.2:  Procedural Fairness in Competition Law Enforcement3 
 
1. 
Each Party shall ensure that before it imposes a sanction or remedy against 
a person for violating its national competition laws, it affords that person:  
 
(a) 
information about the national competition authority’s competition 
concerns; 
  
                                                 
1  This Article is subject to Annex 16-A (Application of Article 16.2, Article 16.3 and Article 16.4 
to Brunei Darussalam). 
 
2  For greater certainty, nothing in paragraph 2 shall be construed to preclude a Party from 
applying its competition laws to commercial activities outside its borders that have anticompetitive 
effects within its jurisdiction.  
 
3  This Article is subject to Annex 16-A (Application of Article 16.2, Article 16.3 and Article 16.4 
to Brunei Darussalam). 
 
16-2 
 
(b) 
a reasonable opportunity to be represented by counsel; and  
 
(c) 
a reasonable opportunity to be heard and present evidence in its 
defence, except that a Party may provide for the person to be heard 
and present evidence within a reasonable time after it imposes an 
interim sanction or remedy.  
 
In particular, each Party shall afford that person a reasonable opportunity to 
present evidence or testimony in its defence, including: if applicable, to offer the 
analysis of a properly qualified expert, to cross-examine any testifying witness; 
and to review and rebut the evidence introduced in the enforcement proceeding4.  
 
2. 
Each Party shall adopt or maintain written procedures pursuant to which 
its national competition law investigations are conducted.  If these investigations 
are not subject to definitive deadlines, each Party’s national competition 
authorities shall endeavour to conduct their investigations within a reasonable 
time frame. 
 
3. 
Each Party shall adopt or maintain rules of procedure and evidence that 
apply to enforcement proceedings concerning alleged violations of its national 
competition laws and the determination of sanctions and remedies thereunder.  
These rules shall include procedures for introducing evidence, including expert 
evidence if applicable, and shall apply equally to all parties to a proceeding. 
 
4. 
Each Party shall provide a person that is subject to the imposition of a 
sanction or remedy for violation of its national competition laws with the 
opportunity to seek review of the sanction or remedy, including review of alleged 
substantive or procedural errors, in a court or other independent tribunal 
established under that Party’s laws.  
 
5. 
Each Party shall authorise its national competition authorities to resolve 
alleged violations voluntarily by consent of the authority and the person subject to 
the enforcement action.  A Party may provide for such voluntary resolution to be 
subject to judicial or independent tribunal approval or a public comment period 
before becoming final. 
 
6. 
If a Party’s national competition authority issues a public notice that 
reveals the existence of a pending or ongoing investigation, that authority shall 
avoid implying in that notice that the person referred to in that notice has engaged 
in the alleged conduct or violated the Party’s national competition laws.    
 
7. 
If a Party’s national competition authority alleges a violation of its 
national competition laws, that authority shall be responsible for establishing the 
                                                 
4  For the purposes of this Article, “enforcement proceedings” means judicial or administrative 
proceedings following an investigation into the alleged violation of the competition laws. 
 
 
16-3 
 
legal and factual basis for the alleged violation in an enforcement proceeding.5 
 
8. 
Each Party shall provide for the protection of business confidential 
information, and other information treated as confidential under its law, obtained 
by its national competition authorities during the investigative process.  If a 
Party’s national competition authority uses or intends to use that information in an 
enforcement proceeding, the Party shall, if it is permissible under its law and as 
appropriate, provide a procedure to allow the person under investigation timely 
access to information that is necessary to prepare an adequate defence to the 
national competition authority’s allegations. 
 
9. 
Each Party shall ensure that its national competition authorities afford a 
person under investigation for possible violation of the national competition laws 
of that Party reasonable opportunity to consult with those competition authorities 
with respect to significant legal, factual or procedural issues that arise during the 
investigation. 
 
 
Article 16.3:  Private Rights of Action6 
 
1. 
For the purposes of this Article, “private right of action” means the right of 
a person to seek redress, including injunctive, monetary or other remedies, from a 
court or other independent tribunal for injury to that person’s business or property 
caused by a violation of national competition laws, either independently or 
following a finding of violation by a national competition authority. 
 
2. 
Recognising that a private right of action is an important supplement to the 
public enforcement of national competition laws, each Party should adopt or 
maintain laws or other measures that provide an independent private right of 
action. 
 
3. 
If a Party does not adopt or maintain laws or other measures that provide 
an independent private right of action, the Party shall adopt or maintain laws or 
other measures that provide a right that allows a person: 
 
(a) 
to request that the national competition authority initiate an 
investigation into an alleged violation of national competition laws; 
and  
 
(b) 
to seek redress from a court or other independent tribunal 
following a finding of violation by the national competition 
                                                 
5  Nothing in this paragraph shall prevent a Party from requiring that a person against whom such 
an allegation is made be responsible for establishing certain elements in defence of the allegation. 
 
6  This Article is subject to Annex 16-A (Application of Article 16.2, Article 16.3 and Article 16.4 
to Brunei Darussalam).

authority.  
 
4. 
Each Party shall ensure that a right provided pursuant to paragraph 2 or 3 
is available to persons of another Party on terms that are no less favourable than 
those available to its own persons.  
 
5. 
A Party may establish reasonable criteria for the exercise of any rights it 
creates or maintains in accordance with this Article. 
 
 
Article 16.4:  Cooperation  
 
1. 
The Parties recognise the importance of cooperation and coordination 
between their respective national competition authorities to foster effective 
competition law enforcement in the free trade area.  Accordingly, each Party shall: 
 
(a) 
cooperate in the area of competition policy by exchanging 
information on the development of competition policy; and 
 
(b) 
cooperate, as appropriate, on issues of competition law 
enforcement, including through notification, consultation and the 
exchange of information.  
 
2. 
A Party’s national competition authorities may consider entering into a 
cooperation arrangement or agreement with the competition authorities of another 
Party that sets out mutually agreed terms of cooperation.  
 
3. 
The Parties agree to cooperate in a manner compatible with their 
respective laws, regulations and important interests, and within their reasonably 
available resources. 
 
 
Article 16.5:  Technical Cooperation 
 
Recognising that the Parties can benefit by sharing their diverse 
experience in developing, applying and enforcing competition law and in 
developing and implementing competition policies, the Parties shall consider 
undertaking mutually agreed technical cooperation activities, subject to available 
resources, including: 
 
(a) 
providing advice or training on relevant issues, including through 
the exchange of officials;  
  
(b) 
exchanging information and experiences on competition advocacy, 
including ways to promote a culture of competition; and  
  
(c) 
assisting a Party as it implements a new national competition law.

Article 16.6:  Consumer Protection 
 
1. 
The Parties recognise the importance of consumer protection policy and 
enforcement to creating efficient and competitive markets and enhancing 
consumer welfare in the free trade area. 
 
2. 
For the purposes of this Article, fraudulent and deceptive commercial 
activities refers to those fraudulent and deceptive commercial practices that cause 
actual harm to consumers, or that pose an imminent threat of such harm if not 
prevented, for example:  
 
(a) 
a practice of making misrepresentations of material fact, including 
implied factual misrepresentations, that cause significant detriment 
to the economic interests of misled consumers;  
 
(b) 
a practice of failing to deliver products or provide services to 
consumers after the consumers are charged; or  
 
(c) 
a practice of charging or debiting consumers’ financial, telephone 
or other accounts without authorisation. 
 
3. 
Each Party shall adopt or maintain consumer protection laws or other laws 
or regulations that proscribe fraudulent and deceptive commercial activities.7 
 
4. 
The Parties recognise that fraudulent and deceptive commercial activities 
increasingly transcend national borders and that cooperation and coordination 
between the Parties is desirable to effectively address these activities. 
 
5. 
Accordingly, the Parties shall promote, as appropriate, cooperation and 
coordination on matters of mutual interest related to fraudulent and deceptive 
commercial activities, including in the enforcement of their consumer protection 
laws. 
 
6. 
The Parties shall endeavour to cooperate and coordinate on the matters set 
out in this Article through the relevant national public bodies or officials 
responsible for consumer protection policy, laws or enforcement, as determined 
by each Party and compatible with their respective laws, regulations and 
important interests and within their reasonably available resources. 
 
 
                                                 
7  For greater certainty, the laws or regulations a Party adopts or maintains to proscribe these 
activities can be civil or criminal in nature. 
 
16-6 
 
Article 16.7:  Transparency 
 
1. 
The Parties recognise the value of making their competition enforcement 
policies as transparent as possible.  
 
2. 
Recognising the value of the APEC Competition Law and Policy Database 
in enhancing the transparency of national competition laws, policies and 
enforcement activities, each Party shall endeavour to maintain and update its 
information on that database.

On request of another Party, a Party shall make available to the requesting 
Party public information concerning: 
 
(a) 
its competition law enforcement policies and practices; and 
 
(b) 
exemptions and immunities to its national competition laws, 
provided that the request specifies the particular good or service 
and market of concern and includes information explaining how 
the exemption or immunity may hinder trade or investment 
between the Parties. 
 
4. 
Each Party shall ensure that a final decision finding a violation of its 
national competition laws is made in writing and sets out, in non-criminal matters, 
findings of fact and the reasoning, including legal and, if applicable, economic 
analysis, on which the decision is based.  
 
5. 
Each Party shall further ensure that a final decision referred to in 
paragraph 4 and any order implementing that decision are published, or if 
publication is not practicable, are otherwise made available to the public in a 
manner that enables interested persons and other Parties to become acquainted 
with them.  Each Party shall ensure that the version of the decision or order that is 
made available to the public does not include confidential information that is 
protected from public disclosure by its law.
