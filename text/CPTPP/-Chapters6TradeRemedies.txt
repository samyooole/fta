CHAPTER 6 
 
TRADE REMEDIES 
 
 
Section A:  Safeguard Measures 
 
Article 6.1:  Definitions 
 
 
For the purposes of this Section: 
 
domestic industry means, with respect to an imported good, the producers as a 
whole of the like or directly competitive good operating within the territory of a 
Party, or those producers whose collective production of the like or directly 
competitive good constitutes a major proportion of the total domestic production 
of that good; 
 
serious injury means a significant overall impairment in the position of a 
domestic industry; 
 
threat of serious injury means serious injury that, on the basis of facts and not 
merely on allegation, conjecture or remote possibility, is clearly imminent; 
  
transition period means, in relation to a particular good, the three-year period 
beginning on the date of entry into force of this Agreement, except where the 
tariff elimination for the good occurs over a longer period of time, in which case 
the transition period shall be the period of the staged tariff elimination for that 
good; and 
 
transitional safeguard measure means a measure described in Article 6.3.2 
(Imposition of a Transitional Safeguard Measure). 
 
 
Article 6.2:  Global Safeguards  
 
1. 
Nothing in this Agreement affects the rights and obligations of the Parties 
under Article XIX of GATT 1994 and the Safeguards Agreement.  
 
2. 
Except as provided in paragraph 3, nothing in this Agreement shall confer 
any rights or impose any obligations on the Parties with regard to actions taken 
pursuant to Article XIX of GATT 1994 and the Safeguards Agreement. 
 
3. 
A Party that initiates a safeguard investigatory process shall provide to the 
other Parties an electronic copy of the notification given to the WTO Committee 
on Safeguards under Article 12.1(a) of the Safeguards Agreement.  
 
 
6-2 
4. 
No Party shall apply or maintain a safeguard measure under this Chapter, 
to any product imported under a tariff rate quota (TRQ) established by the Party 
under this Agreement.  A Party taking a safeguard measure under Article XIX of 
GATT 1994 and the Safeguards Agreement may exclude from the safeguard 
measure imports of originating goods under a TRQ established by the Party under 
this Agreement and set out in Appendix A to the Party’s Schedule to Annex 2-D 
(Tariff Commitments), if such imports are not a cause of serious injury or threat 
thereof. 
 
5. 
No Party shall apply or maintain two or more of the following measures, 
with respect to the same good, at the same time: 
 
(a) 
a transitional safeguard measure under this Chapter; 
 
(b) 
a safeguard measure under Article XIX of GATT 1994 and the 
Safeguards Agreement; 
 
(c) 
a safeguard measure set out in Appendix B to its Schedule to 
Annex 2-D (Tariff Commitments); or 
 
 
(d) 
an emergency action under Chapter 4 (Textiles and Apparel 
Goods). 
 
 
Article 6.3:  Imposition of a Transitional Safeguard Measure 
 
1. 
A Party may apply a transitional safeguard measure described in paragraph 
2, during the transition period only, if as a result of the reduction or elimination of 
a customs duty pursuant to this Agreement: 
 
(a) 
an originating good of another Party, individually, is being 
imported into the Party’s territory in such increased quantities, in 
absolute terms or relative to domestic production, and under such 
conditions, as to cause or threaten to cause serious injury to the 
domestic industry that produces a like or directly competitive 
good; or 
 
(b) 
an originating good of two or more Parties, collectively, is being 
imported into the Party’s territory in such increased quantities, in 
absolute terms or relative to domestic production, and under such 
conditions, as to cause or threaten to cause serious injury to the 
domestic industry that produces a like or directly competitive good, 
provided that the Party applying the transitional safeguard measure 
demonstrates, with respect to the imports from each such Party 
against which the transitional safeguard measure is applied, that 
imports of the originating good from each of those Parties have 
increased, in absolute terms or relative to domestic production, 
 
6-3 
since the date of entry into force of this Agreement for those 
Parties. 
 
2. 
If the conditions in paragraph 1 are met, the Party may, to the extent 
necessary to prevent or remedy serious injury and to facilitate adjustment: 
 
(a) 
suspend the further reduction of any rate of customs duty provided 
for under this Agreement on the good; or 
  
(b) 
increase the rate of customs duty on the good to a level not to 
exceed the lesser of: 
 
(i) 
the most-favoured-nation applied rate of customs duty in 
effect at the time the measure is applied; and 
 
(ii) 
the most-favoured-nation applied rate of customs duty in 
effect on the day immediately preceding the date of entry 
into force of this Agreement for that Party. 
 
The Parties understand that neither tariff rate quotas nor quantitative restrictions 
would be a permissible form of transitional safeguard measure. 
 
 
Article 6.4:  Standards for a Transitional Safeguard Measure 
 
1. 
A Party shall maintain a transitional safeguard measure only for such  
period of time as may be necessary to prevent or remedy serious injury and to 
facilitate adjustment. 
 
2. 
That period shall not exceed two years, except that the period may be 
extended by up to one year if the competent authority of the Party that applies the 
measure determines, in conformity with the procedures set out in Article 6.5 
(Investigation Procedures and Transparency Requirements), that the transitional 
safeguard measure continues to be necessary to prevent or remedy serious injury 
and to facilitate adjustment. 
 
3. 
No Party shall maintain a transitional safeguard measure beyond the 
expiration of the transition period. 
 
4. 
In order to facilitate adjustment in a situation where the expected duration 
of a transitional safeguard measure is over one year, the Party that applies the 
measure shall progressively liberalise it at regular intervals during the period of 
application. 
 
5. 
On the termination of a transitional safeguard measure, the Party that 
applied the measure shall apply the rate of customs duty set out in the Party’s 
 
6-4 
Schedule to Annex 2-D (Tariff Commitments) as if that Party had never applied 
the transitional safeguard measure. 
 
6. 
No Party shall apply a transitional safeguard measure more than once on 
the same good. 
 
 
Article 6.5:  Investigation Procedures and Transparency Requirements  
 
1. 
A Party shall apply a transitional safeguard measure only following an 
investigation by the Party’s competent authorities in accordance with Article 3 
and Article 4.2(c) of the Safeguards Agreement; to this end, Article 3 and Article 
4.2(c) of the Safeguards Agreement are incorporated into and made part of this 
Agreement, mutatis mutandis. 
 
2. 
In the investigation described in paragraph 1, the Party shall comply with 
the requirements of Article 4.2(a) and Article 4.2(b) of the Safeguards Agreement; 
to this end, Article 4.2(a) and Article 4.2(b) of the Safeguards Agreement are 
incorporated into and made part of this Agreement, mutatis mutandis. 
 
 
Article 6.6:  Notification and Consultation  
 
1. 
A Party shall promptly notify the other Parties, in writing, if it: 
 
(a) 
initiates a transitional safeguard investigation under this Chapter; 
 
(b) 
makes a finding of serious injury, or threat of serious injury, 
caused by increased imports, as set out in Article 6.3 (Imposition 
of a Transitional Safeguard Measure); 
 
(c) 
takes a decision to apply or extend a transitional safeguard 
measure; and  
 
(d) 
takes a decision to modify a transitional safeguard measure 
previously undertaken. 
 
2. 
A Party shall provide to the other Parties a copy of the public version of 
the report of its competent authorities that is required under Article 6.5.1 
(Investigation Procedures and Transparency Requirements). 
 
3. 
When a Party makes a notification pursuant to paragraph 1(c) that it is 
applying or extending a transitional safeguard measure, that Party shall include in 
that notification: 
 
(a) 
evidence of serious injury, or threat of serious injury, caused by 
increased imports of an originating good of another Party or Parties 
 
6-5 
as a result of the reduction or elimination of a customs duty 
pursuant to this Agreement; 
 
(b) 
a precise description of the originating good subject to the 
transitional safeguard measure including its heading or subheading 
under the HS Code, on which the schedules of tariff commitments 
in Annex 2-D (Tariff Commitments) are based; 
 
(c) 
a precise description of the transitional safeguard measure; 
 
(d) 
the date of the transitional safeguard measure’s introduction, its 
expected duration and, if applicable, a timetable for progressive 
liberalisation of the measure; and 
 
(e) 
in the case of an extension of the transitional safeguard measure, 
evidence that the domestic industry concerned is adjusting. 
 
4. 
On request of a Party whose good is subject to a transitional safeguard 
proceeding under this Chapter, the Party that conducts that proceeding shall enter 
into consultations with the requesting Party to review a notification under 
paragraph 1 or any public notice or report that the competent investigating 
authority issued in connection with the proceeding. 
 
 
Article 6.7:  Compensation 
 
1. 
A Party applying a transitional safeguard measure shall, after consultations 
with each Party against whose good the transitional safeguard measure is applied, 
provide mutually agreed trade liberalising compensation in the form of 
concessions that have substantially equivalent trade effects or equivalent to the 
value of the additional duties expected to result from the transitional safeguard 
measure.  The Party shall provide an opportunity for those consultations no later 
than 30 days after the application of the transitional safeguard measure. 
 
2. 
If the consultations under paragraph 1 do not result in an agreement on 
trade liberalising compensation within 30 days, any Party against whose good the 
transitional safeguard measure is applied may suspend the application of 
substantially equivalent concessions to the trade of the Party applying the 
transitional safeguard measure. 
 
3. 
A Party against whose good the transitional safeguard measure is applied 
shall notify the Party applying the transitional safeguard measure in writing at 
least 30 days before it suspends concessions in accordance with paragraph 2.  
 
4. 
The obligation to provide compensation under paragraph 1 and the right to 
suspend concessions under paragraph 2 terminates on the termination of the 
transitional safeguard measure.

Section B: Antidumping and Countervailing Duties 
 
Article 6.8:  Antidumping and Countervailing Duties  
 
1. 
Each Party retains its rights and obligations under Article VI of GATT 
1994, the AD Agreement and the SCM Agreement. 
 
2. 
Nothing in this Agreement shall confer any rights or impose any 
obligations on the Parties with regard to proceedings or measures taken pursuant 
to Article VI of GATT 1994, the AD Agreement or the SCM Agreement. 
 
3. 
No Party shall have recourse to dispute settlement under Chapter 28 
(Dispute Settlement) for any matter arising under this Section or Annex 6-A 
(Practices Relating to Antidumping and Countervailing Duty Proceedings).  
 
 
 
 
 
 
6-7 
 
 
Annex 6-A 
 
Practices Relating to Antidumping and Countervailing Duty Proceedings 
 
 
The Parties recognise, in Article 6.8 (Antidumping and Countervailing 
Duties), the right of the Parties to apply trade remedy measures consistent with 
Article VI of GATT 1994, the AD Agreement and the SCM Agreement, and 
further recognise the following practices1 as promoting the goals of transparency 
and due process in trade remedy proceedings: 
 
(a) 
Upon receipt by a Party’s investigating authorities of a properly 
documented antidumping or countervailing duty application with 
respect to imports from another Party, and no later than seven days 
before initiating an investigation, the Party provides written 
notification of its receipt of the application to the other Party.  
 
(b) 
In any proceeding in which the investigating authorities determine 
to conduct an in-person verification of information that is provided 
by a respondent,2 and that is pertinent to the calculation of 
antidumping duty margins or the level of a countervailable subsidy, 
the investigating authorities promptly notify each respondent of 
their intent, and: 
 
(i) 
provide to each respondent at least 10 working days 
advance notice of the dates on which the authorities intend 
to conduct an in-person verification of the information;  
 
(ii) 
at least five working days prior to an in-person verification, 
provide to the respondent a document that sets out the 
topics the respondent should be prepared to address during 
the verification and that describes the types of supporting 
documentation to be made available for review; and 
 
                                                           
1  The practices included in this Annex do not constitute a comprehensive list of practices relating 
to antidumping and countervailing duty proceedings.  No inference shall be drawn from the 
inclusion or exclusion of a particular aspect of such proceedings in this list. 
 
2  For the purposes of this paragraph, “respondent” means a producer, manufacturer, exporter, 
importer, and, where appropriate, a government or government entity, that is required by a Party’s 
investigating authorities to respond to an antidumping or countervailing duty questionnaire.  
 
 
6-8 
(iii) 
after an in-person verification is completed, and subject to 
the protection of confidential information3, issue a written 
report that describes the methods and procedures followed 
in carrying out the verification and the extent to which the 
information provided by the respondent was supported by 
the documents reviewed during the verification.  The report 
is made available to all interested parties in sufficient time 
for the parties to defend their interests.  
 
(c) 
A Party’s investigating authorities maintain a public file for each 
investigation and review that contains: 
 
(i) 
all non-confidential documents that are part of the record of 
the investigation or review; and 
 
(ii) 
to the extent feasible without revealing confidential 
information, non-confidential summaries of confidential 
information that is contained in the record of each 
investigation or review.  To the extent that individual 
information is not susceptible of summarisation, it may be 
aggregated by the investigating authority. 
 
 
The public file and a list of all documents that are contained in the 
record of the investigation or review are physically available for 
inspection and copying during the investigating authorities’ normal 
business hours or electronically available for download.4  
 
(d) 
If, in an antidumping or countervailing duty action that involves 
imports from another Party, a Party’s investigating authorities 
determine that a timely response to a request for information does 
not comply with the request, the investigating authorities inform 
the interested party that submitted the response of the nature of the 
deficiency and, to the extent practicable in light of time limits 
established to complete the antidumping or countervailing duty 
action, provide that interested party with an opportunity to remedy 
or explain the deficiency.  If that interested party submits further 
information in response to that deficiency and the investigating 
authorities find that the response is not satisfactory, or that the 
response is not submitted within the applicable time limits, and if 
the investigating authorities disregard all or part of the original and 
                                                           
3  For the purposes of this Annex, “confidential information” includes information which is 
provided on a confidential basis and which is by its nature confidential, for example, because its 
disclosure would be of significant competitive advantage to a competitor or because its disclosure 
would have a significantly adverse effect upon a person supplying the information or upon a 
person from whom that person acquired the information. 
 
 4  Charges for the copies, if any, are limited in amount to the approximate cost of the services 
rendered. 
 
6-9 
subsequent responses, the investigating authorities explain in the 
determination or other written document the reasons for 
disregarding the information. 
 
(e) 
Before a final determination is made, the investigating authorities 
inform all interested parties of the essential facts that form the 
basis of the decision whether to apply definitive measures.  Subject 
to the protection of confidential information, the investigating 
authorities may use any reasonable means to disclose the essential 
facts, which includes a report summarising the data in the record, a 
draft or preliminary determination or some combination of those 
reports or determinations, to provide interested parties an 
opportunity to respond to the disclosure of essential facts.
