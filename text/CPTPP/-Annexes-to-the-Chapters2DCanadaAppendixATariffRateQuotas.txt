APPENDIX A 
 
TARIFF RATE QUOTAS OF CANADA 
 
 
Section A:  General Provisions 
 
1.  
This Appendix sets out the modifications to the Schedule to Canada’s 
Customs Tariff that reflect the tariff rate quotas (TRQs) that Canada shall apply to 
certain originating goods under this Agreement.  In particular, originating goods 
of Parties included under this Appendix shall be subject to the rates of duty set out 
in this Appendix in lieu of the rates of duty specified in Chapters 1 through 97 of 
the Schedule to Canada’s Customs Tariff.  Notwithstanding any other provision of 
Canada’s Customs Tariff, originating goods under this Agreement in the quantities 
described in this Appendix shall be permitted entry into the territory of Canada as 
provided in this Appendix.  Furthermore, any quantity of originating goods 
imported from a Party under a TRQ provided for in this Appendix shall not be 
counted toward the in-quota quantity of any TRQ provided for such goods under 
Canada’s WTO tariff schedule or any other trade agreement. 
 
2. 
The product or products covered by each TRQ set out in Section B are 
informally identified in the title to the paragraph setting out the TRQ.  These titles 
are included solely to assist readers in understanding this Appendix and shall not 
alter or supersede the coverage established through identification of covered codes 
of Canada’s Customs Tariff.  
 
3. 
Canada shall administer all TRQs provided for in this Agreement and set 
out in Section B of this Appendix according to the following provisions: 
 
(a) 
Canada shall administer its TRQs through an import licensing 
system. 
 
(b) 
Notwithstanding the definition of “year” provided in paragraph 
6(c) of Section A to Annex 2-D (Tariff Commitments), “quota 
year” in this appendix means the 12-month period over which a 
TRQ applies and is allocated.  “quota year 1” has the meaning 
assigned to “year 1” in subparagraph 6(a)(iv)(A) of Section A to 
Annex 2-D (Tariff Commitments). 
 
(c) 
Canada shall allocate its TRQs each quota year to eligible 
applicants.  An eligible applicant means a resident of Canada, 
active in the applicable Canadian dairy, poultry or egg sector, as 
appropriate, and that is compliant with the Export and Import 
Permits Act and its regulations.  In assessing eligibility, Canada 
shall not discriminate against applicants who have not previously 
ANNEX 2-D – APPENDIX A – CANADA – 2 
 
imported the product subject to a TRQ but who meet the residency, 
activity and compliance criteria. 
 
(d) 
Canada reserves the right to allocate any TRQ or portion of a TRQ 
through auctioning for no more than the first seven quota years 
after entry into force of the Agreement for Canada. 
 
(e) 
Canada reserves the right to allocate a portion of each TRQ, not to 
exceed 10 per cent of the annual aggregate quantity, in priority for 
the importation of goods that are in scarce supply in the Canadian 
market.  Scarce supply  means a good which is deemed not 
available in Canada in sufficient supply to satisfy Canadian 
demand. 
 
4. 
Canada’s TRQs shall apply to originating goods. 
 
5. 
For the purposes of this Appendix, the term “metric tonnes” shall be 
abbreviated as “MT”.
