Nothing in this Chapter, Chapter 9 (Investment), Chapter 10 (Cross-Border Trade in Services), Chapter 13 (Telecommunications) including specifically Article 13.24 (Relation to Other Chapters), or Chapter 14 (Electronic Commerce), shall apply to non-discriminatory measures of general application taken by any public entity in pursuit of monetary and related credit policies or exchange rate policies.  This paragraph shall not affect a Party’s obligations under Article 9.10 (Performance Requirements) with respect to measures covered by Chapter 9 (Investment), under Article 9.9 (Transfers) or Article 10.12 (Payments and Transfers).                                                   10  The Parties understand that the term “prudential reasons” includes the maintenance of the safety, soundness, integrity, or financial responsibility of individual financial institutions or cross-border financial service suppliers as well as the safety, and financial and operational integrity of payment and clearing systems.  11  For greater certainty, if a measure challenged under Section B of Chapter 9 (Investment) is determined to have been adopted or maintained by a Party for prudential reasons in accordance with procedures in Article 11.22 (Investment Disputes in Financial Services), a tribunal shall find that the measure is not inconsistent with the Party’s obligations in the Agreement and accordingly shall not award any damages with respect to that measure. 11-12 3.

This paragraph does not prejudice any other provision of this Agreement that permits a Party to restrict transfers.  4. For greater certainty, nothing in this Chapter shall be construed to prevent a Party from adopting or enforcing measures necessary to secure compliance with laws or regulations that are not inconsistent with this Chapter, including those relating to the prevention of deceptive and fraudulent practices or to deal with the effects of a default on financial services contracts, subject to the requirement that such measures are not applied in a manner which would constitute a means of arbitrary or unjustifiable discrimination between Parties or between Parties and non-Parties where like conditions prevail, or a disguised restriction on investment in financial institutions or cross-border trade in financial services as covered by this Chapter.   Article 11.12:  Recognition  1. A Party may recognise prudential measures of another Party or a non-Party in the application of measures covered by this Chapter.12  That recognition may be:  (a) accorded autonomously;  (b) achieved through harmonisation or other means; or  (c) based upon an agreement or arrangement with another Party or a non-Party.  2.

Each Party shall, to the extent practicable:  (a) publish in advance any such regulation that it proposes to adopt and the purpose of the regulation; and  (b) provide interested persons and other Parties with a reasonable opportunity to comment on that proposed regulation.  4. At the time that it adopts a final regulation, a Party should, to the extent practicable, address in writing the substantive comments received from interested persons with respect to the proposed regulation.13  5. To the extent practicable, each Party should allow a reasonable period of time between publication of a final regulation of general application and the date when it enters into effect.  6. Each Party shall ensure that the rules of general application adopted or maintained by a self-regulatory organisation of the Party are promptly published or otherwise made available in a manner that enables interested persons to become acquainted with them.  7. Each Party shall maintain or establish appropriate mechanisms for responding to inquiries from interested persons regarding measures of general application covered by this Chapter.                                                   13  For greater certainty, a Party may address those comments collectively on an official government website. 11-14 8. Each Party’s regulatory authorities shall make publicly available the requirements, including any documentation required, for completing an application relating to the supply of financial services.  9. On request of an applicant, a Party’s regulatory authority shall inform the applicant of the status of its application.

An application shall not be considered complete until all relevant hearings have been held and all necessary information has been received.  If it is not practicable for a decision to be made within 120 days, the regulatory authority shall notify the applicant without undue delay and shall endeavour to make the decision within a reasonable period of time thereafter.  11. On request of an unsuccessful applicant, a regulatory authority that has denied an application shall, to the extent practicable, inform the applicant of the reasons for denial of the application.   Article 11.14:  Self-Regulatory Organisations  If a Party requires a financial institution or a cross-border financial service supplier of another Party to be a member of, participate in, or have access to, a self-regulatory organisation in order to provide a financial service in or into its territory, it shall ensure that the self-regulatory organisation observes the obligations contained in Article 11.3 (National Treatment) and Article 11.4 (Most-Favoured-Nation Treatment).   Article 11.15:  Payment and Clearing Systems  Under terms and conditions that accord national treatment, each Party shall grant financial institutions of another Party established in its territory access to payment and clearing systems operated by public entities, and to official funding and refinancing facilities available in the normal course of ordinary business.

Article 11.16:  Expedited Availability of Insurance Services  The Parties recognise the importance of maintaining and developing regulatory procedures to expedite the offering of insurance services by licensed 11-15 suppliers.  These procedures may include: allowing introduction of products unless those products are disapproved within a reasonable period of time; not requiring product approval or authorisation of insurance lines for insurance other than insurance sold to individuals or compulsory insurance; or not imposing limitations on the number or frequency of product introductions.  If a Party maintains regulatory product approval procedures, that Party shall endeavour to maintain or improve those procedures.   Article 11.17:  Performance of Back-Office Functions  1. The Parties recognise that the performance of the back-office functions of a financial institution in its territory by the head office or an affiliate of the financial institution, or by an unrelated service supplier, either inside or outside its territory, is important to the effective management and efficient operation of that financial institution.  While a Party may require financial institutions to ensure compliance with any domestic requirements applicable to those functions, they recognise the importance of avoiding the imposition of arbitrary requirements on the performance of those functions.  2. For greater certainty, nothing in paragraph 1 prevents a Party from requiring a financial institution in its territory to retain certain functions.   Article 11.18:  Specific Commitments  Annex 11-B (Specific Commitments) sets out certain specific commitments by each Party.   Article 11.19:  Committee on Financial Services  1.

Each Party shall establish a contact point to respond to those requests and to facilitate the exchange of information regarding the operation of measures covered by those requests.

These Parties shall enter into consultations with a view to exchanging information on the operation of the measure and to considering whether further steps are necessary and appropriate.  3. Consultations under this Article shall include officials of the authorities specified in Annex 11-D (Authorities Responsible for Financial Services).  4. For greater certainty, nothing in this Article shall be construed to require a Party to derogate from its law regarding sharing of information between financial regulators or the requirements of an agreement or arrangement between financial authorities of the Parties, or to require a regulatory authority to take any action that would interfere with specific regulatory, supervisory, administrative or enforcement matters.     11-17  Article 11.21:  Dispute Settlement  1. Chapter 28 (Dispute Settlement) shall apply as modified by this Article to the settlement of disputes arising under this Chapter.  2.
