TARIFF RATE QUOTAS OF MEXICO 
 
 
Section A: General Provisions 
 
1.   This Appendix sets out the country-specific tariff rate quotas (TRQs) that 
Mexico shall apply to certain originating goods of Parties under this Agreement.  
In particular, originating goods of Parties included under this Appendix shall be 
subject to the rates of duty set out in this Appendix in lieu of the rates of duty 
specified in Chapters 1 through 97 of the Mexico’s tariff schedule of the General 
Import and Export Duties Law (Tarifa de la Ley de los Impuestos Generales de 
Importación y de Exportación – (LIGIE)).  Notwithstanding any other provision 
of the LIGIE, originating goods of Parties to this Agreement in the quantities 
described in this Appendix shall be permitted entry into the territory of Mexico as 
provided in this Appendix. Furthermore, except as provided below, any quantity 
of originating goods imported from a Party under a TRQ provided for in this 
Appendix shall not be counted toward the in-quota quantity of any TRQ provided 
for  such  goods  under  Mexico’s  WTO  Tariff  Schedule  or  any  other  trade 
agreement. 
 
2.  Mexico shall administer its TRQs provided for in this Agreement and set 
out in Section B of this Appendix in accordance with the terms set out in this 
Appendix  and  Section  D  (Tariff  Rate  Quota  Administration)  of  Chapter  2 
(National Treatment and Market Access for Goods). 
 
3.   Should Mexico allocate quotas through auctioning, they shall be published 
online a month in advance, with no restrictions on participation or bid volumes, 
and all winning bidders shall pay the price of the lowest winning bid.  Within two 
weeks of the auction, the names of winning bidders and prices and quantities of 
winning bids shall be published online. 
 
4.  For quotas administered on a first come, first served basis, Mexico may 
require importers to obtain an import licence from the Secretaría de Economía for 
each shipment.  Such licences will be issued forthwith without any conditions, on 
presentation of a proof of purchase of goods covered by quotas listed below, 
provided  quota  volumes  remain  available.    Mexico  may  consider  the 
discontinuation  of  the  import  licence  as  improvements  in  customs  operations 
permit. 
 
5.  The product or products covered by each TRQ set out in Section B are 
informally identified in the title to the paragraph setting out the TRQ.  These titles 
are included solely to assist readers in understanding this Appendix and shall not 
  ANNEX 2-D – APPENDIX A-1/A-2 – MEXICO – 1   
 
alter or supersede the coverage established through identification of covered codes 
of Mexico’s LIGIE. 
 
6.  Each TRQ set out in this Appendix shall apply to an aggregate quantity of 
originating  goods  of  the  Parties  identified  in  the  first  subparagraph  of  the 
paragraph setting out the TRQ. 
 
7.  For the purposes  of this Appendix, the term “metric tonnes” shall be 
abbreviated as “MT”.

COUNTRY SPECIFIC ALLOCATION FOR SUGAR OF MEXICO 
 
 
1.   CSA-MX:  Country Specific Allocation for Sugar 
 
(a)  Mexico  shall  grant  tariff  concessions  for  sugar  under  this 
Agreement only when it requires to import sugar to address its 
domestic  demand  through  unilateral  MFN  tariff  rate  quotas 
(TRQs).    Otherwise,  all  sugar  imports  into  Mexico  under  this 
Agreement shall be subject to the rate of customs duty applied 
under the WTO Agreement. 
 
(b)  The Country Specific Allocation (CSA) set out in this Appendix is 
designated in the Tariff Schedule of Mexico to Annex 2-D (Tariff 
Commitments) as “CSA-MX”. 
 
(c)  Mexico shall grant to Australia 7 per cent of any unilateral MFN 
TRQ Mexico may open, subject to the following conditions: 
 
(i)  The CSA allocated to Australia shall be imported duty free.  
 
(ii)  Mexico  shall  allocate  this  CSA  to  Australia  through 
auctioning  in  accordance  with  Mexico’s  internal  legal 
procedures. 
 
(iii)  Australia shall notify Mexico if it cannot fulfill the CSA, so 
that Mexico can reallocate it to other countries. 
 
(iv)  Australia may export to Mexico under the unilateral MFN 
TRQ during the two months following the date on which 
the respective certificates are issued.  Nevertheless, in cases 
where the validity of the unilateral sugar TRQ under an 
MFN basis exceeds four months, Australia shall have three 
months  to  export  to  Mexico  from  the  date  that  quota 
certificate is issued. 
 
(v)  To  be  eligible  for  the  tariff  preference  established  in 
subparagraph  (i),  the  sugar  from  Australia  shall  comply 
with the applicable product specific rule of origin set out in 
Annex 3-D (Product-Specific Rules of Origin). 
 
(vi)  Any amount of CSA not used by Australia shall not be 
accumulated for subsequent periods. 
  ANNEX 2-D – APPENDIX A-1/A-2 – MEXICO – 12

allocated to Australia, the conditions established for the 
unilateral MFN TRQ shall apply, without prejudice to the 
rights and obligations of this country under the WTO. 
 
(viii)   For the purposes of this CSA, the scope of "sugar" covers 
those goods classified under heading 17.01, and tariff items 
1702.90.01,  1806.10.01  and  2106.90.05.    Mexico  shall

tariff items subject to the CSA.
