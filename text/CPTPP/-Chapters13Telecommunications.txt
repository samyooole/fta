Annex 13-A (Rural Telephone Suppliers – United States) and Annex 13-B (Rural Telephone Suppliers – Peru) include additional provisions relating to the scope of this Chapter.   Article 13.3:  Approaches to Regulation  1. The Parties recognise the value of competitive markets to deliver a wide choice in the supply of telecommunications services and to enhance consumer welfare, and that economic regulation may not be needed if there is effective competition or if a service is new to a market.  Accordingly, the Parties recognise that regulatory needs and approaches differ market by market, and that each Party may determine how to implement its obligations under this Chapter.   2. In this respect, the Parties recognise that a Party may:  (a) engage in direct regulation either in anticipation of an issue that the Party expects may arise or to resolve an issue that has already arisen in the market;  (b)  rely on the role of market forces, particularly with respect to market segments that are, or are likely to be, competitive or that have low barriers to entry, such as services provided by telecommunications suppliers that do not own network facilities;2 or    1  For greater certainty, nothing in this Chapter shall be construed to require a Party to authorise an enterprise of another Party to establish, construct, acquire, lease, operate or supply public telecommunications services, unless otherwise provided for in this Agreement.  2  Consistent with this subparagraph, the United States, based on its evaluation of the state of competition of the U.S. commercial mobile market, has not applied major supplier-related measures pursuant to Article 13.7 (Treatment by Major Suppliers of Public Telecommunications Services), Article 13.9.2 (Resale), Article 13.11 (Interconnection with Major Suppliers), Article 13.13 (Co-Location by Major Suppliers) or Article 13.14 (Access to Poles, Ducts, Conduits and Rights-of-Way Owned or Controlled by Major Suppliers) to the commercial mobile market.  13-4                                                   (c) use any other appropriate means that benefit the long-term interest of end-users.  3.  When a Party engages in direct regulation, it may nonetheless forbear, to the extent provided for in its law, from applying that regulation to a service that the Party classifies as a public telecommunications service, if its telecommunications regulatory body or other competent body determines that:  (a) enforcement of the regulation is not necessary to prevent unreasonable or discriminatory practices;  (b) enforcement of the regulation is not necessary for the protection of consumers; and  (c) forbearance is consistent with the public interest, including promoting and enhancing competition between suppliers of public telecommunications services.   Article 13.4:  Access to and Use of Public Telecommunications Services3  1. Each Party shall ensure that any enterprise of another Party has access to and use of any public telecommunications service, including leased circuits, offered in its territory or across its borders, on reasonable and non-discriminatory terms and conditions.  2. Each Party shall ensure that any service supplier of another Party is permitted to:   (a) purchase or lease, and attach terminal or other equipment that interfaces with a public telecommunications network;  (b) provide services to individual or multiple end-users over leased or owned circuits;   (c) connect leased or owned circuits with public telecommunications networks and services or with circuits leased or owned by another enterprise;4  3  For greater certainty, this Article does not prohibit any Party from requiring an enterprise to obtain a licence to supply any public telecommunications service within its territory.    4  In Viet Nam, networks authorised to establish for the purpose of carrying out, on a non-commercial basis, voice and data telecommunications between members of a closed user group can only directly interconnect with each other where approved in writing by the telecommunications regulatory body.  Viet Nam shall ensure that upon request an applicant receives the reasons for the denial of an authorisation.  Viet Nam shall review this requirement to obtain written approval within two years of the date of entry into force of this Agreement.   13-5                                                   (d) perform switching, signalling, processing and conversion functions; and  (e) use operating protocols of their choice.  3. Each Party shall ensure that an enterprise of any Party may use public telecommunications services for the movement of information in its territory or across its borders, including for intra-corporate communications, and for access to information contained in databases or otherwise stored in machine-readable form in the territory of any Party.   4.  Notwithstanding paragraph 3, a Party may take measures that are necessary to ensure the security and confidentiality of messages and to protect the privacy of personal data of end-users of public telecommunications networks or services, provided that those measures are not applied in a manner that would constitute a means of arbitrary or unjustifiable discrimination or a disguised restriction on trade in services.  5. Each Party shall ensure that no condition is imposed on access to and use of public telecommunications networks and services, other than as necessary to:  (a) safeguard the public service responsibilities of suppliers of public telecommunications networks and services, in particular their ability to make their networks or services generally available to the public; or  (b) protect the technical integrity of public telecommunications networks or services.  6. Provided that they satisfy the criteria set out in paragraph 5, conditions for access to and use of public telecommunications networks and services may include:  (a) a requirement to use a specified technical interface, including an interface protocol, for connection with those networks or services;  (b) a requirement, when necessary, for the interoperability of those networks and services;   (c) type approval of terminal or other equipment that interfaces with the network and technical requirements relating to the attachment of that equipment to those networks; and  (d) a licensing, permit, registration or notification procedure which, if adopted or maintained, is transparent and provides for the processing of applications filed thereunder in accordance with a Party’s laws or regulations. 13-6    Article 13.5:  Obligations Relating to Suppliers of Public Telecommunications Services   Interconnection5  1. Each Party shall ensure that suppliers of public telecommunications services in its territory provide, directly or indirectly within the same territory, interconnection with suppliers of public telecommunications services of another Party.  2. Each Party shall provide its telecommunications regulatory body with the authority to require interconnection at reasonable rates. 3. In carrying out paragraph 1, each Party shall ensure that suppliers of public telecommunications services in its territory take reasonable steps to protect the confidentiality of commercially sensitive information of, or relating to, suppliers and end-users of public telecommunications services obtained as a result of interconnection arrangements and that those suppliers only use that information for the purpose of providing these services. Number Portability  4. Each Party shall ensure that suppliers of public telecommunications services in its territory provide number portability without impairment to quality and reliability, on a timely basis, and on reasonable and non-discriminatory terms and conditions.6   5  For greater certainty, the term “interconnection”, as used in this Chapter, does not include access to unbundled network elements.  6  With respect to certain Parties, this paragraph shall apply as follows:  (a)  for Brunei Darussalam, this paragraph shall not apply until such time as it determines, pursuant to periodic review, that it is economically feasible to implement number portability in Brunei Darussalam;  (b)  for Malaysia, this paragraph shall apply only with respect to commercial mobile services until such time as it determines that it is economically feasible to apply number portability to fixed services; and  (c)  for Viet Nam, this paragraph shall apply to fixed services at such time as it determines that it is technically and economically feasible.  Within four years of the date of entry into force of this Agreement for Viet Nam, it shall conduct a review for it to determine the economic feasibility of applying number portability to fixed services.  With respect to commercial mobile services, this paragraph shall apply to Viet Nam no later than 2020.   13-7                                                   Access to Numbers  5. Each Party shall ensure that suppliers of public telecommunications services of another Party established in its territory are afforded access to telephone numbers on a non-discriminatory basis.7   Article 13.6:  International Mobile Roaming  1. The Parties shall endeavour to cooperate on promoting transparent and reasonable rates for international mobile roaming services that can help promote the growth of trade among the Parties and enhance consumer welfare.  2. A Party may choose to take steps to enhance transparency and competition with respect to international mobile roaming rates and technological alternatives to roaming services, such as:  (a) ensuring that information regarding retail rates is easily accessible to consumers; and  (b) minimising impediments to the use of technological alternatives to roaming, whereby consumers when visiting the territory of a Party from the territory of another Party can access telecommunications services using the device of their choice.  3. The Parties recognise that a Party, when it has the authority to do so, may choose to adopt or maintain measures affecting rates for wholesale international roaming services with a view to ensuring that those rates are reasonable.  If a Party considers it appropriate, it may cooperate on and implement mechanisms with other Parties to facilitate the implementation of those measures, including by entering into arrangements with those Parties.   4. If a Party (the first Party) chooses to regulate rates or conditions for wholesale international mobile roaming services, it shall ensure that a supplier of public telecommunications services of another Party (the second Party) has access to the regulated rates or conditions for wholesale international mobile roaming services for its customers roaming in the territory of the first Party in circumstances in which:8  7  For Viet Nam, this paragraph shall not apply with respect to blocks of numbers that have been allocated prior to entry into force of this Agreement.  8  For greater certainty, no Party shall, solely on the basis of any obligations owed to it by the first Party under a most-favoured-nation provision, or under a telecommunications-specific non-discrimination provision, in any existing international trade agreement, seek or obtain for its suppliers the access to regulated rates or conditions for wholesale international mobile roaming services that is provided under this Article.  13-8                                                   (a) the second Party has entered into an arrangement with the first Party to reciprocally regulate rates or conditions for wholesale international mobile roaming services for suppliers of the two Parties;9 or   (b) in the absence of an arrangement of the type referred to in subparagraph (a), the supplier of public telecommunications services of the second Party, of its own accord:  (i) makes available to suppliers of public telecommunications services of the first Party wholesale international mobile roaming services at rates or conditions that are reasonably comparable to the regulated rates or conditions;10 and   (ii) meets any additional requirements 11  that the first Party imposes with respect to the availability of the regulated rates or conditions.  The first Party may require suppliers of the second Party to fully utilise commercial negotiations to reach agreement on the terms for accessing such rates or conditions.    5. A Party that ensures access to regulated rates or conditions for wholesale international mobile roaming services in accordance with paragraph 4 shall be deemed to be in compliance with its obligations under Article 10.4 (Most-Favoured-Nation Treatment), Article 13.4.1 (Access to and Use of Public Telecommunications Services), and Article 13.7 (Treatment by Major Suppliers of Public Telecommunications Services) with respect to international mobile roaming services.  6.  Each Party shall provide to the other Parties information on rates for retail international mobile roaming services for voice, data and text messages offered to consumers of the Party when visiting the territories of the other Parties.  A Party shall provide that information no later than one year after the date of entry into force of this Agreement for the Party.  Each Party shall update that information 9  For greater certainty, access under this subparagraph to the rates or conditions regulated by the first Party shall be available to a supplier of the second Party only if such regulated rates or conditions are reasonably comparable to those reciprocally regulated under the arrangement referred to in this subparagraph.  The telecommunications regulatory body of the first Party shall, in the case of disagreement, determine whether the rates or conditions are reasonably comparable.    10  For the purposes of this subparagraph, rates or conditions that are reasonably comparable means rates or conditions agreed to be such by the relevant suppliers or, in the case of disagreement, determined to be such by the telecommunications regulatory body of the first Party.  11  For greater certainty, such additional requirements may include, for example, that the rates provided to the supplier of the second Party reflect the reasonable cost of supplying international mobile roaming services by a supplier of the first Party to a supplier of the second Party, as determined through the methodology of the first Party.  13-9                                                   and provide it to the other Parties on an annual basis or as otherwise agreed.  Interested Parties shall endeavour to cooperate on compiling this information into a report to be mutually agreed by the Parties and to be made publicly available.  7. Nothing in this Article shall require a Party to regulate rates or conditions for international mobile roaming services.   Article 13.7:  Treatment by Major Suppliers of Public Telecommunications Services   Each Party shall ensure that a major supplier in its territory accords suppliers of public telecommunications services of another Party treatment no less favourable than that major supplier accords in like circumstances to its subsidiaries, its affiliates or non-affiliated service suppliers regarding:   (a) the availability, provisioning, rates or quality of like public telecommunications services; and  (b) the availability of technical interfaces necessary for interconnection.   Article 13.8:  Competitive Safeguards   1. Each Party shall maintain appropriate measures for the purpose of preventing suppliers of public telecommunications services that, alone or together, are a major supplier in its territory from engaging in or continuing anti-competitive practices.  2. The anti-competitive practices referred to in paragraph 1 include in particular:  (a) engaging in anti-competitive cross-subsidisation;  (b) using information obtained from competitors with anti-competitive results; and  (c) not making available, on a timely basis, to suppliers of public telecommunications services, technical information about essential facilities and commercially relevant information that are necessary for them to provide services.   Article 13.9:  Resale  1. No Party shall prohibit the resale of any public telecommunications 13-10  service.12  2. Each Party shall ensure that a major supplier in its territory:  (a) offers for resale, at reasonable rates 13 , to suppliers of public telecommunications services of another Party, public telecommunications services that the major supplier provides at retail to end-users; and  (b) does not impose unreasonable or discriminatory conditions or limitations on the resale of those services.14  3. Each Party may determine, in accordance with its laws and regulations, which public telecommunications services must be offered for resale by major suppliers pursuant to paragraph 2, based on the need to promote competition or to benefit the long-term interests of end-users.  4. If a Party does not require that a major supplier offer a specific public telecommunications service for resale, it nonetheless shall allow service suppliers to request that the service be offered for resale consistent with paragraph 2, without prejudice to the Party’s decision on the request.   Article 13.10:  Unbundling of Network Elements by Major Suppliers   Each Party shall provide its telecommunications regulatory body or another appropriate body with the authority to require a major supplier in its territory to offer to public telecommunications service suppliers access to network elements on an unbundled basis on terms and conditions, and at cost-oriented rates, that are reasonable, non-discriminatory and transparent for the supply of public telecommunications services.  Each Party may determine the network elements required to be made available in its territory, and the suppliers that may obtain those elements, in accordance with its laws and regulations.   12  Brunei Darussalam may require that licensees who purchase public telecommunications services on a wholesale basis only resell their services to an end-user.  13  For the purposes of this Article, each Party may determine reasonable rates through any methodology it considers appropriate.  14  Where provided in its laws or regulations, a Party may prohibit a reseller that obtains, at wholesale rates, a public telecommunications service available at retail to only a limited category of subscribers from offering the service to a different category of subscribers.  13-11                                                   Article 13.11:  Interconnection with Major Suppliers   General Terms and Conditions  1. Each Party shall ensure that a major supplier in its territory provides interconnection for the facilities and equipment of suppliers of public telecommunications services of another Party:  (a) at any technically feasible point in the major supplier’s network;  (b) under non-discriminatory terms, conditions (including technical standards and specifications) and rates;   (c) of a quality no less favourable than that provided by the major supplier for its own like services, for like services of non-affiliated service suppliers, or for its subsidiaries or other affiliates;  (d) in a timely manner, on terms and conditions (including technical standards and specifications), and at cost-oriented rates, that are transparent, reasonable, having regard to economic feasibility, and sufficiently unbundled so that the suppliers do not have to pay for network components or facilities that they do not require for the service to be provided; and   (e) on request, at points in addition to the network termination points offered to the majority of users, subject to charges that reflect the cost of construction of necessary additional facilities.  Options for Interconnecting with Major Suppliers  2. Each Party shall ensure that a major supplier in its territory provides suppliers of public telecommunications services of another Party with the opportunity to interconnect their facilities and equipment with those of the major supplier through the following options:  (a) a reference interconnection offer or another standard interconnection offer containing the rates, terms and conditions that the major supplier offers generally to suppliers of public telecommunications services; or  (b) the terms and conditions of an interconnection agreement that is in effect.   3. In addition to the options provided in paragraph 2, each Party shall ensure that suppliers of public telecommunications services of another Party have the opportunity to interconnect their facilities and equipment with those of the major supplier through the negotiation of a new interconnection agreement. 13-12   Public Availability of Interconnection Offers and Agreements  4. Each Party shall make publicly available the applicable procedures for interconnection negotiations with a major supplier in its territory.  5. Each Party shall provide means for suppliers of another Party to obtain the rates, terms and conditions necessary for interconnection offered by a major supplier.  Those means include, at a minimum, ensuring:  (a) the public availability of interconnection agreements that are in effect between a major supplier in its territory and other suppliers of public telecommunications services in its territory;  (b) the public availability of rates, terms and conditions for interconnection with a major supplier set by the telecommunications regulatory body or other competent body; or  (c) the public availability of a reference interconnection offer.  Services for which those rates, terms and conditions are made publicly available do not have to include all interconnection-related services offered by a major supplier, as determined by a Party under its laws and regulations.   Article 13.12:  Provisioning and Pricing of Leased Circuits Services by Major Suppliers  1. Each Party shall ensure that a major supplier in its territory provides to service suppliers of another Party leased circuits services that are public telecommunications services in a reasonable period of time on terms and conditions, and at rates, that are reasonable and non-discriminatory, and based on a generally available offer.   2. Further to paragraph 1, each Party shall provide its telecommunications regulatory body or other appropriate bodies the authority to require a major supplier in its territory to offer leased circuits services that are public telecommunications services to service suppliers of another Party at capacity-based and cost-oriented prices.    Article 13.13:  Co-Location by Major Suppliers  1. Subject to paragraphs 2 and 3, each Party shall ensure that a major supplier in its territory provides to suppliers of public telecommunications services of another Party in the Party’s territory physical co-location of equipment necessary for interconnection or access to unbundled network elements based on a generally 13-13  available offer, on a timely basis, and on terms and conditions and at cost-oriented rates, that are reasonable and non-discriminatory.  2. Where physical co-location is not practical for technical reasons or because of space limitations, each Party shall ensure that a major supplier in its territory provides an alternative solution, such as facilitating virtual co-location, based on a generally available offer, on a timely basis, and on terms and conditions and at cost-oriented rates, that are reasonable and non-discriminatory.  3. A Party may determine, in accordance with its laws and regulations, which premises owned or controlled by major suppliers in its territory are subject to paragraphs 1 and 2.  When the Party makes this determination, it shall take into account factors such as the state of competition in the market where co-location is required, whether those premises can be substituted in an economically or technically feasible manner in order to provide a competing service, or other specified public interest factors.   4. If a Party does not require that a major supplier offer co-location at certain premises, it nonetheless shall allow service suppliers to request that those premises be offered for co-location consistent with paragraph 1, without prejudice to the Party’s decision on such a request.   Article 13.14:  Access to Poles, Ducts, Conduits and Rights-of-way Owned or Controlled by Major Suppliers15  1. Each Party shall ensure that a major supplier in its territory provides access to poles, ducts, conduits, and rights-of-way or any other structures as determined by the Party, owned or controlled by the major supplier, to suppliers of public telecommunications services of another Party in the Party’s territory on a timely basis, on terms and conditions and at rates, that are reasonable, non-discriminatory and transparent, subject to technical feasibility.  2. A Party may determine, in accordance with its laws and regulations, the poles, ducts, conduits, rights-of-way or any other structures to which it requires major suppliers in its territory to provide access in accordance with paragraph 1.  When the Party makes this determination, it shall take into account factors such as the competitive effect of lack of such access, whether such structures can be substituted in an economically or technically feasible manner in order to provide a competing service, or other specified public interest factors.   15  Chile may comply with this obligation by maintaining appropriate measures for the purpose of preventing a major supplier in its territory from denying access to poles, ducts, conduits and rights-of-way, owned or controlled by the major supplier.  13-14                                                   Article 13.15:  International Submarine Cable Systems16, 17  Each Party shall ensure that any major supplier who controls international submarine cable landing stations in the Party’s territory provides access to those landing stations, consistent with the provisions of Article 13.11 (Interconnection with Major Suppliers), Article 13.12 (Provisioning and Pricing of Leased Circuits Services by Major Suppliers) and Article 13.13 (Co-Location by Major Suppliers), to public telecommunications suppliers of another Party.   Article 13.16:  Independent Regulatory Bodies and Government Ownership  1. Each Party shall ensure that its telecommunications regulatory body is separate from, and not accountable to, any supplier of public telecommunications services.  With a view to ensuring the independence and impartiality of telecommunications regulatory bodies, each Party shall ensure that its telecommunications regulatory body does not hold a financial interest 18  or maintain an operating or management role 19  in any supplier of public telecommunications services.  2. Each Party shall ensure that the regulatory decisions and procedures of its telecommunications regulatory body or other competent authority related to provisions contained in this Chapter are impartial with respect to all market participants.   3. No Party shall accord more favourable treatment to a supplier of telecommunications services in its territory than that accorded to a like service supplier of another Party on the basis that the supplier receiving more favourable treatment is owned by the national government of the Party.    16  For Chile, this provision shall apply when its telecommunications regulatory body obtains the authority to implement this provision.  Nonetheless, Chile shall ensure reasonable and non-discriminatory access to international submarine cable systems including landing stations in its territory.   17  For Viet Nam, co-location for international submarine landing stations owned or controlled by the major supplier in the territory of Viet Nam excludes physical co-location.  18  This paragraph shall not be construed to prohibit a government entity of a Party other than the telecommunications regulatory body from owning equity in a supplier of public telecommunications services.  19  Viet Nam’s telecommunications regulatory body assumes the role of representing the government as owner of certain telecommunications suppliers.  In this context, Viet Nam shall comply with this provision by ensuring that any regulatory actions with respect to those suppliers do not materially disadvantage any competitor.  13-15                                                   Article 13.17:  Universal Service   Each Party has the right to define the kind of universal service obligation it wishes to maintain.  Each Party shall administer any universal service obligation that it maintains in a transparent, non-discriminatory and competitively neutral manner, and shall ensure that its universal service obligation is not more burdensome than necessary for the kind of universal service that it has defined.   Article 13.18:  Licensing Process  1. If a Party requires a supplier of public telecommunications services to have a licence, the Party shall ensure the public availability of:  (a) all the licensing criteria and procedures that it applies;  (b) the period that it normally requires to reach a decision concerning an application for a licence; and  (c) the terms and conditions of all licences in effect.  2. Each Party shall ensure that, on request, an applicant receives the reasons for the:  (a) denial of a licence;  (b) imposition of supplier-specific conditions on a licence;   (c) revocation of a licence; or  (d) refusal to renew a licence.   Article 13.19:  Allocation and Use of Scarce Resources  1. Each Party shall administer its procedures for the allocation and use of scarce telecommunications resources, including frequencies, numbers and rights-of-way, in an objective, timely, transparent and non-discriminatory manner.  2. Each Party shall make publicly available the current state of frequency bands allocated and assigned to specific suppliers20 but retains the right not to provide detailed identification of frequencies that are allocated or assigned for specific government uses.  3. For greater certainty, a Party’s measures allocating and assigning spectrum 20  For Peru, the commitment to make publicly available assigned bands shall apply only to bands used to provide access to end-users. 13-16                                                   and managing frequency are not per se inconsistent with Article 10.5 (Market Access) either as it applies to cross-border trade in services or through the operation of Article 10.2.2 (Scope) to an investor or covered investment of another Party.  Accordingly, each Party retains the right to establish and apply spectrum and frequency management policies that may have the effect of limiting the number of suppliers of public telecommunications services, provided that the Party does so in a manner that is consistent with other provisions of this Agreement.  This includes the ability to allocate frequency bands, taking into account current and future needs and spectrum availability.  4. When making a spectrum allocation for commercial telecommunications services, each Party shall endeavour to rely on an open and transparent process that considers the public interest, including the promotion of competition.  Each Party shall endeavour to rely generally on market-based approaches in assigning spectrum for terrestrial commercial telecommunications services.  To this end, each Party shall have the authority to use mechanisms such as auctions, if appropriate, to assign spectrum for commercial use.   Article 13.20:  Enforcement  Each Party shall provide its competent authority with the authority to enforce the Party’s measures relating to the obligations set out in Article 13.4 (Access to and Use of Public Telecommunications Services), Article 13.5 (Obligations Relating to Suppliers of Public Telecommunications Services), Article 13.7 (Treatment by Major Suppliers of Public Telecommunications Services), Article 13.8 (Competitive Safeguards), Article 13.9 (Resale), Article 13.10 (Unbundling of Network Elements by Major Suppliers), Article 13.11 (Interconnection with Major Suppliers), Article 13.12 (Provisioning and Pricing of Leased Circuits Services by Major Suppliers), Article 13.13 (Co-Location by Major Suppliers), Article 13.14 (Access to Poles, Ducts, Conduits and Rights-of-way Owned or Controlled by Major Suppliers) and Article 13.15 (International Submarine Cable Systems).
