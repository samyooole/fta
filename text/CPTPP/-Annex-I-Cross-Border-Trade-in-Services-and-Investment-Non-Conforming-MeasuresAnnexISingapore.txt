A non-resident financial institution may in certain 
circumstances be unable to borrow in Singapore dollars more 
than S$5 million from a resident financial institution owing to 
the following restrictions placed on financial institutions’ 
lending of the Singapore dollar to non-resident financial 
institutions. 
 
A financial institution shall not extend to any non-resident 
financial institution Singapore dollar credit facilities exceeding 
S$5 million per non-resident financial institution: 
 
(a)   where the Singapore dollar proceeds are to be 
used outside of Singapore, unless: 
 
(i)   such proceeds are swapped or converted 
into foreign currency upon draw-down 
or before remittance abroad; or  
 
(ii)   such proceeds are for the purpose of 
preventing settlement failures where the 
ANNEX I – SINGAPORE – 29 financial institution extends a temporary 
Singapore dollar overdraft to any vostro 
account of any non-resident financial 
institution, and the financial institution 
takes reasonable efforts to ensure that 
the overdraft is covered within two 
business days; and  
 
(b)   where there is reason to believe that the 
Singapore dollar proceeds may be used for 
Singapore dollar currency speculation, 
regardless of whether the Singapore dollar 
proceeds are to be used in Singapore or outside 
of Singapore.  
 
A financial institution shall not arrange Singapore dollar equity 
or bond issues for any non-resident financial institution where 
the Singapore dollar proceeds are to be used outside Singapore, 
unless the proceeds are swapped or converted into foreign 
currency upon draw-down or before remittance abroad.
