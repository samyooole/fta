of the Parties included under this Appendix shall be subject to the rates of duty set 
out in this Appendix in lieu of the rates of duty specified in Chapters 1 through 97 
of the HSV.  Notwithstanding any other provision of the HSV, originating goods 
of the Parties in the quantities described in this Appendix shall be permitted entry 
into the territory of Viet Nam as provided in this Appendix.  Furthermore, any 
quantity of originating goods imported from a Party under a TRQ provided for in 
this Appendix shall not be counted toward the in-quota quantity of any TRQ 
provided for such goods under Viet Nam’s WTO tariff schedule or any other trade 
agreement.

The product or products covered by each TRQ set out below are 
informally identified in the title to the paragraph setting out the TRQ.  These titles 
are included solely to assist readers in understanding this Appendix and shall not 
alter or supersede the coverage for each TRQ established through identification of 
covered codes of the HSV.
