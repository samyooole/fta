Chile has the right of first offer at market prices and terms for

amounts, in such mining products and that can be

separated” means that the costs incurred to 
recover the four types of substances referred to

commercialise and deliver those substances shall 
be lower than their commercial value. 
 
Furthermore, only the Chilean Nuclear Energy Commission 
(Comisión Chilena de Energía Nuclear), or parties authorised

Only a Chilean natural or juridical person may register an 
aircraft in Chile.  Such juridical person must be constituted in 
Chile with principal domicile and real and effective seat in 
Chile.  In addition, a majority of its ownership must be held by 
 
ANNEX I – CHILE – 29 
Chilean natural or juridical persons, which in turn must comply 
with the aforementioned requisites.  The aviation authority may 
allow the registration of aircrafts owned by foreign natural or 
juridical persons, provided they are employed in Chile or 
exercise a permanent professional activity or industry in Chile. 
 
The president, manager, majority of directors and administrators 
of the juridical person must be Chilean natural persons. 
 
 
 
A foreign registered private aircraft engaged in non-commercial 
activities may not remain in Chile more than 30 days from its 
date of entry into Chile, unless authorised by the General 
Directorate for Civil Aeronautics (Dirección General de 
Aeronáutica Civil).  For greater certainty, this measure shall not 
apply to specialty air services as defined in Article 9.1 
(Definitions), except for glider towing and parachute jumping.  
 
 
 
Foreign aviation personnel that do not hold a licence granted by 
Chilean civil aviation authorities, shall be allowed to work in 
that capacity in Chile, provided that Chilean civil aviation 
authorities validate the licence or authorisation granted by a 
foreign country.  In the absence of an international agreement 
regulating such validation, the licence or authorisation shall be 
granted under conditions of reciprocity.  In that case, proof shall 
be submitted showing that the licences or authorisations were 
issued or validated by the pertinent authorities in the country 
where the aircraft is registered, that the documents are in force, 
and that the requirements for issuing or validating such licences 
and authorisations meet or exceed the standards required in 
Chile for analogous cases. 
 
 
 
Air services may be supplied by Chilean or foreign companies 
subject to the condition that foreigners grant similar rights to 
Chilean aviation companies when so requested.  The Civil 
Aviation Board (Junta de Aeronáutica Civil), by means of a 
substantiated resolution (resolución fundada), may terminate, 
suspend or limit any class of commercial aviation services 
carried out solely in Chilean territory by foreign companies or 
aircraft, if in their country of origin the right to equal treatment 
for Chilean companies and aircraft is denied.

cargo between different points of the national territory and 
between such points and naval artefacts installed in territorial 
waters or in the exclusive economic zone. 
 
 
 
 Foreign merchant vessels may be able to participate in cabotage 
when cargo volumes exceed 900 tons, following a public tender 
called by the user with due anticipation.  When the cargo 
volumes involved are equal to or less than 900 tons, and no 
vessels flying the Chilean flag are available, the Maritime 
Authority may authorise embarking such cargo on foreign 
merchant vessels.  
 
 International maritime transport of cargo to or from Chile is 
subject to the principle of reciprocity. 
 
 In the event that Chile should adopt, for reasons of reciprocity, 
a cargo reservation measure applicable to international cargo 
transportation between Chile and a non-Party, the reserved 
cargo shall be transported in Chilean-flag vessels or in vessels 
considered as such.
