The Parties affirm their commitment to the Declaration on TRIPS and 
Public Health.  In particular, the Parties have reached the following 
understandings regarding this Chapter: 
 
(a) 
The obligations of this Chapter do not and should not prevent a 
Party from taking measures to protect public health.  Accordingly, 
while reiterating their commitment to this Chapter, the Parties 
affirm that this Chapter can and should be interpreted and 
implemented in a manner supportive of each Party’s right to protect 
public health and, in particular, to promote access to medicines for 
all.  Each Party has the right to determine what constitutes a 
national emergency or other circumstances of extreme urgency, it 
being understood that public health crises, including those relating 
to HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis, malaria and other epidemics, can 
represent a national emergency or other circumstances of extreme 
urgency. 
18-4 
 
(b) 
In recognition of the commitment to access to medicines that are 
supplied in accordance with the Decision of the WTO General 
Council of August 30, 2003 on the Implementation of Paragraph 
Six of the Doha Declaration on the TRIPS Agreement and Public 
Health (WT/L/540) and the WTO General Council Chairman’s 
Statement 
Accompanying 
the 
Decision

WTO 
General 
Council 
Chairperson’s 
Statement 
Accompanying 
the 
Decision 
(JOB(05)/319 and Corr. 1,WT/GC/M/100) (collectively, the 
“TRIPS/health solution”), this Chapter does not and should not 
prevent the effective utilisation of the TRIPS/health solution. 
 
(c) 
With respect to the aforementioned matters, if any waiver of any 
provision of the TRIPS Agreement, or any amendment of the 
TRIPS Agreement, enters into force with respect to the Parties, and 
a Party’s application of a measure in conformity with that waiver or 
amendment is contrary to the obligations of this Chapter, the 
Parties shall immediately consult in order to adapt this Chapter as 
appropriate in the light of the waiver or amendment. 
 
2. 
Each Party shall notify, if it has not already done so, the WTO of its 
acceptance of the Protocol amending the TRIPS Agreement, done at Geneva on 
December 6, 2005.

favourable than it accords to its own nationals with regard to the protection4 of 
intellectual property rights. 
 
2. 
With respect to secondary uses of phonograms by means of analog 
communications and free over-the-air broadcasting, however, a Party may limit 
the rights of the performers and producers of another Party to the rights its persons 
are accorded within the jurisdiction of that other Party. 
 
3. 
A Party may derogate from paragraph 1 in relation to its judicial and 
administrative procedures, including requiring a national of another Party to 
designate an address for service of process in its territory, or to appoint an agent in

acquisition, scope, maintenance and enforcement of intellectual property rights as well as matters 
affecting the use of intellectual property rights specifically covered by this Chapter.  Further, for 
the purposes of this paragraph, “protection” also includes the prohibition on the circumvention of 
effective technological measures set out in Article 18.68 (TPMs) and the provisions concerning 
rights management information set out in Article 18.69 (RMI).  For greater certainty, “matters 
affecting the use of intellectual property rights specifically covered by this Chapter” in respect of 
works, performances and phonograms, include any form of payment, such as licensing fees, 
royalties, equitable remuneration, or levies, in respect of uses that fall under the copyright and 
related rights in this Chapter.  The preceding sentence is without prejudice to a Party’s 
interpretation of “matters affecting the use of intellectual property rights” in footnote 3 of the 
TRIPS Agreement. 
18-6

that meets or comes subsequently to meet the criteria for protection under this 
Chapter. 
 
2. 
Unless provided in Article 18.64 (Application of Article 18 of the Berne 
Convention and Article 14.6 of the TRIPS Agreement), a Party shall not be

18-7 
required to restore protection to subject matter that on the date of entry into force 
of this Agreement for that Party has fallen into the public domain in its territory. 
 
3. 
This Chapter does not give rise to obligations in respect of acts that 
occurred before the date of entry into force of this Agreement for a Party. 
 
 
Article 18.11:  Exhaustion of Intellectual Property Rights 
 
Nothing in this Agreement prevents a Party from determining whether or 
under what conditions the exhaustion of intellectual property rights applies under

streamlining the procedures and processes of their respective patent offices for the 
benefit of all users of the patent system and the public as a whole. 
 
2. 
Further to paragraph 1, the Parties shall endeavour to cooperate among 
their respective patent offices to facilitate the sharing and use of search and 
examination work of other Parties.  This may include:

9  The Parties recognise the importance of multilateral efforts to promote the sharing and use of 
search and examination results, with a view to improving the quality of search and examination 
processes and to reducing the costs for both applicants and patent offices. 
18-9 
 
2. 
The Parties also acknowledge the importance of informational materials, 
such as publicly accessible databases of registered intellectual property rights that 
assist in the identification of subject matter that has fallen into the public domain. 
 
 
Article 18.16:  Cooperation in the Area of Traditional Knowledge 
 
1. 
The Parties recognise the relevance of intellectual property systems and 
traditional knowledge associated with genetic resources to each other, when that 
traditional knowledge is related to those intellectual property systems. 
 
2. 
The Parties shall endeavour to cooperate through their respective agencies 
responsible for intellectual property, or other relevant institutions, to enhance the 
understanding of issues connected with traditional knowledge associated with 
genetic resources, and genetic resources. 
 
3. 
The Parties shall endeavour to pursue quality patent examination, which 
may include:

that in determining prior art, relevant publicly available 
documented 
information 
related 
to 
traditional 
knowledge 
associated with genetic resources may be taken into account; 
 
(b) 
an opportunity for third parties to cite, in writing, to the competent 
examining authority prior art disclosures that may have a bearing

18-10 
 
Section C: Trademarks 
 
 
Article 18.18:  Types of Signs Registrable as Trademarks  
 
No Party shall require, as a condition of registration, that a sign be visually 
perceptible, nor shall a Party deny registration of a trademark only on the ground 
that the sign of which it is composed is a sound.  Additionally, each Party shall 
make best efforts to register scent marks.  A Party may require a concise and 
accurate description, or graphical representation, or both, as applicable, of the 
trademark.  
 
 
Article 18.19:  Collective and Certification Marks 
 
 
Each Party shall provide that trademarks include collective marks and 
certification marks.  A Party is not obligated to treat certification marks as a 
separate category in its law, provided that those marks are protected.  Each Party 
shall also provide that signs that may serve as geographical indications are 
capable of protection under its trademark system.10 
 
 
Article 18.20:  Use of Identical or Similar Signs 
 
Each Party shall provide that the owner of a registered trademark has the 
exclusive right to prevent third parties that do not have the owner’s consent from 
using in the course of trade identical or similar signs, including subsequent 
geographical indications,11, 12 for goods or services that are related to those goods 
or services in respect of which the owner’s trademark is registered, where such 
use would result in a likelihood of confusion.  In the case of the use of an identical 
sign for identical goods or services, a likelihood of confusion shall be presumed. 
 
 
                                            
10  Consistent with the definition of a geographical indication in Article 18.1 (Definitions), any 
sign or combination of signs shall be eligible for protection under one or more of the legal means 
for protecting geographical indications, or a combination of such means.  
 
11  For greater certainty, the exclusive right in this Article applies to cases of unauthorised use of 
geographical indications with goods for which the trademark is registered, in cases in which the 
use of that geographical indication in the course of trade would result in a likelihood of confusion 
as to the source of the goods. 
 
12  For greater certainty, the Parties understand that this Article should not be interpreted to affect 
their rights and obligations under Articles 22 and 23 of the TRIPS Agreement. 
18-11 
Article 18.21:  Exceptions 
 
A Party may provide limited exceptions to the rights conferred by a 
trademark, such as fair use of descriptive terms, provided that those exceptions 
take account of the legitimate interest of the owner of the trademark and of third 
parties.  
 
Article 18.22:  Well-Known Trademarks 
 
1. 
No Party shall require as a condition for determining that a trademark is 
well-known that the trademark has been registered in the Party or in another 
jurisdiction, included on a list of well-known trademarks, or given prior 
recognition as a well-known trademark. 
 
2. 
Article 6bis of the Paris Convention shall apply, mutatis mutandis, to 
goods or services that are not identical or similar to those identified by a well-
known trademark,13 whether registered or not, provided that use of that trademark 
in relation to those goods or services would indicate a connection between those 
goods or services and the owner of the trademark, and provided that the interests 
of the owner of the trademark are likely to be damaged by such use. 
 
3. 
Each Party recognises the importance of the Joint Recommendation 
Concerning Provisions on the Protection of Well-Known Marks as adopted by the 
Assembly of the Paris Union for the Protection of Industrial Property and the 
General Assembly of WIPO at the Thirty-Fourth Series of Meetings of the 
Assemblies of the Member States of WIPO September 20 to 29, 1999. 
 
4. 
Each Party shall provide for appropriate measures to refuse the application 
or cancel the registration and prohibit the use of a trademark that is identical or 
similar to a well-known trademark14, for identical or similar goods or services, if 
the use of that trademark is likely to cause confusion with the prior well-known 
trademark.  A Party may also provide such measures including in cases in which 
the subsequent trademark is likely to deceive. 
 
 
Article 18.23:  Procedural Aspects of Examination, Opposition and 
Cancellation 
 
Each Party shall provide a system for the examination and registration of 
trademarks which includes among other things: 
 
                                            
13  In determining whether a trademark is well-known in a Party, that Party need not require that 
the reputation of the trademark extend beyond the sector of the public that normally deals with the 
relevant goods or services. 
  
14  The Parties understand that a well-known trademark is one that was already well-known before, 
as determined by a Party, the application for, registration of or use of the first-mentioned 
trademark. 
18-12 
(a) 
communicating to the applicant in writing, which may be by 
electronic means, the reasons for any refusal to register a 
trademark; 
 
(b) 
providing the applicant with an opportunity to respond to 
communications from the competent authorities, to contest any 
initial refusal, and to make a judicial appeal of any final refusal to 
register a trademark; 
 
(c) 
providing an opportunity to oppose the registration of a trademark 
or to seek cancellation15 of a trademark; and 
 
(d) 
requiring administrative decisions in opposition and cancellation 
proceedings to be reasoned and in writing, which may be provided 
by electronic means. 
 
 
Article 18.24:  Electronic Trademarks System 
 
Each Party shall provide: 
 
(a) 
a system for the electronic application for, and maintenance of, 
trademarks; and 
 
(b) 
a publicly available electronic information system, including an 
online database, of trademark applications and of registered 
trademarks. 
 
 
Article 18.25:  Classification of Goods and Services 
 
Each Party shall adopt or maintain a trademark classification system that is 
consistent with the Nice Agreement Concerning the International Classification of 
Goods and Services for the Purposes of the Registration of Marks, done at Nice, 
June 15, 1957, as revised and amended (Nice Classification).  Each Party shall 
provide that: 
 
(a) 
registrations and the publications of applications indicate the goods 
and services by their names, grouped according to the classes 
established by the Nice Classification;16 and 
 
                                            
15  For greater certainty, cancellation for purposes of this Section may be implemented through 
nullification or revocation proceedings. 
 
16  A Party that relies on translations of the Nice Classification shall follow updated versions of the 
Nice Classification to the extent that official translations have been issued and published. 
18-13 
(b) 
goods or services may not be considered as being similar to each 
other on the ground that, in any registration or publication, they are 
classified in the same class of the Nice Classification.  Conversely, 
each Party shall provide that goods or services may not be 
considered as being dissimilar from each other on the ground that, 
in any registration or publication, they are classified in different 
classes of the Nice Classification. 
 
 
Article 18.26:  Term of Protection for Trademarks 
 
Each Party shall provide that initial registration and each renewal of 
registration of a trademark is for a term of no less than 10 years. 
 
 
Article 18.27:  Non-Recordal of a Licence 
 
No Party shall require recordal of trademark licences: 
 
(a) 
to establish the validity of the licence; or 
 
(b) 
as a condition for use of a trademark by a licensee to be deemed to 
constitute use by the holder in a proceeding that relates to the 
acquisition, maintenance or enforcement of trademarks. 
 
 
Article 18.28:  Domain Names  
 
1. 
In connection with each Party’s system for the management of its country-
code top-level domain (ccTLD) domain names, the following shall be available: 
 
(a) 
an appropriate procedure for the settlement of disputes, based on, 
or modelled along the same lines as, the principles established in 
the Uniform Domain-Name Dispute-Resolution Policy, as approved 
by the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers 
(ICANN) or that: 
 
(i) 
is designed to resolve disputes expeditiously and at low 
cost; 
 
(ii) 
is fair and equitable; 
 
(iii) 
is not overly burdensome; and 
 
(iv) 
does not preclude resort to judicial proceedings; and 
 
18-14 
(b) 
online public access to a reliable and accurate database of contact 
information concerning domain name registrants,  
 
in accordance with each Party’s law and, if applicable, relevant administrator 
policies regarding protection of privacy and personal data. 
 
2. 
In connection with each Party’s system for the management of ccTLD 
domain names, appropriate remedies17 shall be available at least in cases in which 
a person registers or holds, with a bad faith intent to profit, a domain name that is 
identical or confusingly similar to a trademark.  
 
 
Section D: Country Names 
 
 
Article 18.29:  Country Names 
 
 
Each Party shall provide the legal means for interested persons to prevent 
commercial use of the country name of a Party in relation to a good in a manner 
that misleads consumers as to the origin of that good. 
 
 
Section E: Geographical Indications 
 
 
Article 18.30:  Recognition of Geographical Indications 
 
 
The Parties recognise that geographical indications may be protected 
through a trademark or sui generis system or other legal means.  
 
 
Article 18.31:  Administrative Procedures for the Protection or Recognition 
of Geographical Indications 
 
 
If a Party provides administrative procedures for the protection or 
recognition of geographical indications, whether through a trademark or a sui 
generis system, that Party shall with respect to applications for that protection or 
petitions for that recognition: 
 
(a) 
accept those applications or petitions without requiring intercession 
by a Party on behalf of its nationals;18 
 
                                            
17  The Parties understand that such remedies may, but need not, include, among other things, 
revocation, cancellation, transfer, damages or injunctive relief. 
  
18  This subparagraph also applies to judicial procedures that protect or recognise a geographical 
indication. 
18-15 
(b) 
process those applications or petitions without imposition of overly 
burdensome formalities;  
 
(c) 
ensure that its laws and regulations governing the filing of those 
applications or petitions are readily available to the public and 
clearly set out the procedures for these actions; 
 
(d) 
make available information sufficient to allow the general public to 
obtain guidance concerning the procedures for filing applications or 
petitions and the processing of those applications or petitions in 
general; and allow an applicant, a petitioner, or their representative 
to ascertain the status of specific applications and petitions; 
 
(e) 
ensure that those applications or petitions are published for 
opposition and provide procedures for opposing geographical 
indications that are the subject of applications or petitions; and  
 
(f) 
provide for cancellation19 of the protection or recognition afforded 
to a geographical indication. 
 
 
Article 18.32:  Grounds of Opposition and Cancellation20 
 
1. 
If a Party protects or recognises a geographical indication through the 
procedures referred to in Article 18.31 (Administrative Procedures for the 
Protection or Recognition of Geographical Indications), that Party shall provide 
procedures that allow interested persons to object to the protection or recognition 
of a geographical indication, and that allow for any such protection or recognition 
to be refused or otherwise not afforded, at least, on the following grounds: 
 
(a) 
the geographical indication is likely to cause confusion with a 
trademark that is the subject of a pre-existing good faith pending 
application or registration in the territory of the Party; 
 
(b) 
the geographical indication is likely to cause confusion with a pre-
existing trademark, the rights to which have been acquired in 
accordance with the Party’s law; and 
 
(c) 
the geographical indication is a term customary in common 
language as the common name 21  for the relevant good in the 
territory of the Party. 
                                            
19  For greater certainty, for the purposes of this Section, cancellation may be implemented through 
nullification or revocation proceedings. 
 
20  A Party is not required to apply this Article to geographical indications for wines and spirits or 
to applications or petitions for those geographical indications. 
 
18-16 
 
2. 
If a Party has protected or recognised a geographical indication through 
the procedures referred to in Article 18.31 (Administrative Procedures for the 
Protection or Recognition of Geographical Indications), that Party shall provide 
procedures that allow for interested persons to seek the cancellation of a 
geographical indication, and that allow for the protection or recognition to be 
cancelled, at least, on the grounds listed in paragraph 1.  A Party may provide that 
the grounds listed in paragraph 1 shall apply as of the time of filing the request for 
protection or recognition of a geographical indication in the territory of the 
Party.22 
 
3. 
No Party shall preclude the possibility that the protection or recognition of 
a geographical indication may be cancelled, or otherwise cease, on the basis that 
the protected or recognised term has ceased meeting the conditions upon which 
the protection or recognition was originally granted in that Party. 
 
4. 
If a Party has in place a sui generis system for protecting unregistered 
geographical indications by means of judicial procedures, that Party shall provide 
that its judicial authorities have the authority to deny the protection or recognition 
of a geographical indication if any of the circumstances identified in paragraph 1 
has been established. 23  That Party shall also provide a process that allows 
interested persons to commence a proceeding on the grounds identified in 
paragraph 1. 
 
5. 
If a Party provides protection or recognition of a geographical indication 
through the procedures referred to in Article 18.31 (Administrative Procedures for 
the Protection or Recognition of Geographical Indications) to the translation or 
transliteration of that geographical indication, that Party shall make available 
procedures that are equivalent to, and grounds that are the same as, those referred 
to in paragraphs 1 and 2 with respect to that translation or transliteration.  
 
                                                                                                                        
21  For greater certainty, if a Party provides for the procedures in Article 18.31 (Administrative 
Procedures for the Protection or Recognition of Geographical Indications) and this Article to be 
applied to geographical indications for wines and spirits or applications or petitions for those 
geographical indications, the Parties understand nothing shall require a Party to protect or 
recognise a geographical indication of any other Party with respect to products of the vine for 
which the relevant indication is identical with the customary name of a grape variety existing in 
the territory of that Party. 
 
22  For greater certainty, if the grounds listed in paragraph 1 did not exist in a Party’s law as of the 
time of filing of the request for protection or recognition of a geographical indication under Article 
18.31 (Administrative Procedures for the Protection or Recognition of Geographical Indications), 
that Party is not required to apply those grounds for the purposes of paragraph 2 or paragraph 4 of 
this Article in relation to that geographical indication. 
 
23  As an alternative to this paragraph, if a Party has in place a sui generis system of the type 
referred to in this paragraph as of the applicable date under Article 18.36.6 (International 
Agreements), that Party shall at least provide that its judicial authorities have the authority to deny 
the protection or recognition of a geographical indication if the circumstances identified in 
paragraph 1(c) have been established. 
18-17 
 
Article 18.33:  Guidelines for Determining Whether a Term is the Term 
Customary in the Common Language 
 
 
With respect to the procedures in Article 18.31 (Administrative Procedures 
for the Protection or Recognition of Geographical Indications) and Article 18.32 
(Grounds of Opposition and Cancellation), in determining whether a term is the 
term customary in common language as the common name for the relevant good 
in the territory of a Party, that Party’s authorities shall have the authority to take 
into account how consumers understand the term in the territory of that Party.  
Factors relevant to such consumer understanding may include: 
 
(a) 
whether the term is used to refer to the type of good in question, as 
indicated by competent sources such as dictionaries, newspapers 
and relevant websites; and 
 
(b) 
how the good referenced by the term is marketed and used in trade 
in the territory of that Party.24 
 
 
Article 18.34:  Multi-Component Terms 
 
 
With respect to the procedures in Article 18.31 (Administrative Procedures 
for the Protection or Recognition of Geographical Indications) and Article 18.32 
(Grounds of Opposition and Cancellation), an individual component of a multi-
component term that is protected as a geographical indication in the territory of a 
Party shall not be protected in that Party if that individual component is a term 
customary in the common language as the common name for the associated good. 
 
 
Article 18.35:  Date of Protection of a Geographical Indication 
 
 
If a Party grants protection or recognition to a geographical indication 
through the procedures referred to in Article 18.31 (Administrative Procedures for 
the Protection or Recognition of Geographical Indications), that protection or 
recognition shall commence no earlier than the filing date25 in the Party or the 
registration date in the Party, as applicable. 
 
 
                                            
24  For the purposes of this subparagraph, a Party’s authorities may take into account, as 
appropriate, whether the term is used in relevant international standards recognised by the Parties 
to refer to a type or class of good in the territory of the Party. 
 
25  For greater certainty, the filing date referred to in this paragraph includes, as applicable, the 
priority filing date under the Paris Convention. 
18-18 
Article 18.36:  International Agreements 
 
1. 
If a Party protects or recognises a geographical indication pursuant to an 
international agreement, as of the applicable date under paragraph 6, involving a 
Party or a non-Party and that geographical indication is not protected through the 
procedures referred to in Article 18.31 (Administrative Procedures for the 
Protection or Recognition of Geographical Indications) 26  or Article 18.32.4 
(Grounds of Opposition and Cancellation), that Party shall apply at least 
procedures and grounds that are equivalent to those in Article 18.31(e) 
(Administrative Procedures for the Protection or Recognition of Geographical 
Indications) and Article 18.32.1 (Grounds of Opposition and Cancellation), as 
well as: 
 
(a) 
make available information sufficient to allow the general public to 
obtain guidance concerning the procedures for protecting or 
recognising the geographical indication and allow interested 
persons to ascertain the status of requests for protection or 
recognition; 
 
(b) 
make available to the public, on the Internet, details regarding the 
terms that the Party is considering protecting or recognising 
through an international agreement involving a Party or a non-
Party, including specifying whether the protection or recognition is 
being considered for any translations or transliterations of those 
terms, and with respect to multi-component terms, specifying the 
components, if any, for which protection or recognition is being 
considered, or the components that are disclaimed; 
 
(c) 
in respect of opposition procedures, provide a reasonable period of 
time for interested persons to oppose the protection or recognition 
of the terms referred to in subparagraph (b).  That period shall 
provide a meaningful opportunity for interested persons to 
participate in an opposition process; and 
 
(d) 
inform the other Parties of the opportunity to oppose, no later than 
the commencement of the opposition period. 
 
2. 
In respect of international agreements referred to in paragraph 6 that 
permit the protection or recognition of a new geographical indication, a Party 
shall:27, 28 
                                            
26  Each Party shall apply Article 18.33 (Guidelines for Determining Whether a Term is the Term 
Customary in the Common Language) and Article 18.34 (Multi-Component Terms) in determining 
whether to grant protection or recognition of a geographical indication pursuant to this paragraph. 
 
27  In respect of an international agreement referred to in paragraph 6 that has geographical 
indications that have been identified, but have not yet received protection or recognition in the 
territory of the Party that is a party to that agreement, that Party may fulfil the obligations of 
paragraph 2 by complying with the obligations of paragraph 1. 
18-19 
 
(a) 
apply paragraph 1(b); 
 
(b) 
provide an opportunity for interested persons to comment regarding 
the protection or recognition of the new geographical indication for 
a reasonable period of time before such a term is protected or 
recognised; and 
 
(c) 
inform the other Parties of the opportunity to comment, no later 
than the commencement of the period for comment. 
 
3. 
For the purposes of this Article, a Party shall not preclude the possibility 
that the protection or recognition of a geographical indication could cease. 
 
4. 
For the purposes of this Article, a Party is not required to apply Article 
18.32 (Grounds of Opposition and Cancellation), or obligations equivalent to 
Article 18.32, to geographical indications for wines and spirits or applications for 
those geographical indications. 
 
5. 
Protection or recognition provided pursuant to paragraph 1 shall 
commence no earlier than the date on which the agreement enters into force or, if 
that Party grants that protection or recognition on a date after the entry into force 
of the agreement, on that later date. 
 
6. 
No Party shall be required to apply this Article to geographical indications 
that have been specifically identified in, and that are protected or recognised 
pursuant to, an international agreement involving a Party or a non-Party, provided 
that the agreement: 
 
(a) 
was concluded, or agreed in principle 29 , prior to the date of 
conclusion, or agreement in principle, of this Agreement; 
 
(b) 
was ratified by a Party prior to the date of ratification of this 
Agreement by that Party; or 
 
(c) 
entered into force for a Party prior to the date of entry into force of 
this Agreement for that Party. 
 
 
                                                                                                                        
 
28  A Party may comply with this Article by applying Article 18.31 (Administrative Procedures for 
the Protection or Recognition of Geographical Indications) and Article 18.32 (Grounds of 
Opposition and Cancellation). 
 
29  For the purpose of this Article, an agreement “agreed in principle” means an agreement 
involving another government, government entity or international organisation in respect of which 
a political understanding has been reached and the negotiated outcomes of the agreement have 
been publically announced. 
18-20 
Section F:  Patents and Undisclosed Test or Other Data 
 
 
Subsection A:  General Patents 
 
 
Article 18.37:  Patentable Subject Matter 
 
1. 
Subject to paragraphs 3 and 4, each Party shall make patents available for 
any invention, whether a product or process, in all fields of technology, provided 
that the invention is new, involves an inventive step and is capable of industrial 
application.30 
 
2. 
Subject to paragraphs 3 and 4 and consistent with paragraph 1, each Party 
confirms that patents are available for inventions claimed as at least one of the 
following: new uses of a known product, new methods of using a known product, 
or new processes of using a known product.  A Party may limit those new 
processes to those that do not claim the use of the product as such.  
 
3. 
A Party may exclude from patentability inventions, the prevention within 
their territory of the commercial exploitation of which is necessary to protect 
ordre public or morality, including to protect human, animal or plant life or health 
or to avoid serious prejudice to nature or the environment, provided that such 
exclusion is not made merely because the exploitation is prohibited by its law.  A 
Party may also exclude from patentability: 
 
(a) 
diagnostic, therapeutic and surgical methods for the treatment of 
humans or animals; 
 
(b) 
animals other than microorganisms, and essentially biological 
processes for the production of plants or animals, other than non-
biological and microbiological processes. 
 
4. 
A Party may also exclude from patentability plants other than 
microorganisms.  However, consistent with paragraph 1 and subject to paragraph 
3, each Party confirms that patents are available at least for inventions that are 
derived from plants. 
 
 
                                            
30  For the purposes of this Section, a Party may deem the terms “inventive step” and “capable of 
industrial application” to be synonymous with the terms “non-obvious” and “useful”, respectively.  
In determinations regarding inventive step, or non-obviousness, each Party shall consider whether 
the claimed invention would have been obvious to a person skilled, or having ordinary skill in the 
art, having regard to the prior art. 
18-21 
Article 18.38:  Grace Period 
 
Each Party shall disregard at least information contained in public 
disclosures used to determine if an invention is novel or has an inventive step, if 
the public disclosure:31, 32 
 
(a) 
was made by the patent applicant or by a person that obtained the 
information directly or indirectly from the patent applicant; and 
 
(b) 
occurred within 12 months prior to the date of the filing of the 
application in the territory of the Party. 
 
 
Article 18.39:  Patent Revocation 
 
1. 
Each Party shall provide that a patent may be cancelled, revoked or 
nullified only on grounds that would have justified a refusal to grant the patent.  A 
Party may also provide that fraud, misrepresentation or inequitable conduct may 
be the basis for cancelling, revoking or nullifying a patent or holding a patent 
unenforceable. 
 
2. 
Notwithstanding paragraph 1, a Party may provide that a patent may be 
revoked, provided it is done in a manner consistent with Article 5A of the Paris 
Convention and the TRIPS Agreement. 
 
 
Article 18.40:  Exceptions 
 
A Party may provide limited exceptions to the exclusive rights conferred 
by a patent, provided that such exceptions do not unreasonably conflict with a 
normal exploitation of the patent and do not unreasonably prejudice the legitimate 
interests of the patent owner, taking account of the legitimate interests of third 
parties. 
 
 
                                            
31  No Party shall be required to disregard information contained in applications for, or 
registrations of, intellectual property rights made available to the public or published by a patent 
office, unless erroneously published or unless the application was filed without the consent of the 
inventor or their successor in title, by a third person who obtained the information directly or 
indirectly from the inventor. 
 
32  For greater certainty, a Party may limit the application of this Article to disclosures made by, or 
obtained directly or indirectly from, the inventor or joint inventor.  For greater certainty, a Party 
may provide that, for the purposes of this Article, information obtained directly or indirectly from 
the patent applicant may be information contained in the public disclosure that was authorised by, 
or derived from, the patent applicant. 
18-22 
Article 18.41:  Other Use Without Authorisation of the Right Holder 
 
 
The Parties understand that nothing in this Chapter limits a Party’s rights 
and obligations under Article 31 of the TRIPS Agreement, any waiver or any 
amendment to that Article that the Parties accept. 
 
 
Article 18.42:  Patent Filing 
 
Each Party shall provide that if an invention is made independently by 
more than one inventor, and separate applications claiming that invention are filed 
with, or for, the relevant authority of the Party, that Party shall grant the patent on 
the application that is patentable and that has the earliest filing date or, if 
applicable, priority date,33 unless that application has, prior to publication,34 been 
withdrawn, abandoned or refused. 
 
 
Article 18.43:  Amendments, Corrections and Observations 
 
Each Party shall provide a patent applicant with at least one opportunity to 
make amendments, corrections and observations in connection with its 
application.35 
 
 
Article 18.44:  Publication of Patent Applications  
 
1. 
Recognising the benefits of transparency in the patent system, each Party 
shall endeavour to publish unpublished pending patent applications promptly after 
the expiration of 18 months from the filing date or, if priority is claimed, from the 
earliest priority date. 
 
2. 
If a pending application is not published promptly in accordance with 
paragraph 1, a Party shall publish that application or the corresponding patent, as 
soon as practicable. 
 
                                            
33  A Party shall not be required to apply this Article in cases involving derivation or in situations 
involving any application that has or had, at any time, at least one claim having an effective filing 
date before the date of entry into force of this Agreement for that Party or any application that has 
or had, at any time, a priority claim to an application that contains or contained such a claim. 
 
34  For greater certainty, a Party may grant the patent to the subsequent application that is 
patentable, if an earlier application has been withdrawn, abandoned, or refused, or is not prior art 
against the subsequent application. 
 
35  A Party may provide that such amendments do not go beyond the scope of the disclosure of the 
invention, as of the filing date. 
18-23 
3. 
Each Party shall provide that an applicant may request the early 
publication of an application prior to the expiration of the period referred to in 
paragraph 1. 
 
 
Article 18.45:  Information Relating to Published Patent Applications and 
Granted Patents 
 
For published patent applications and granted patents, and in accordance 
with the Party’s requirements for prosecution of such applications and patents, 
each Party shall make available to the public at least the following information, to 
the extent that such information is in the possession of the competent authorities 
and is generated on, or after, the date of the entry into force of this Agreement for 
that Party: 
 
(a) 
search and examination results, including details of, or information 
related to, relevant prior art searches;  
 
(b) 
as appropriate, non-confidential communications from applicants; 
and 
 
(c) 
patent and non-patent related literature citations submitted by 
applicants and relevant third parties. 
 
 
Article 18.46:  Patent Term Adjustment for Unreasonable Granting 
Authority Delays 
 
1. 
Each Party shall make best efforts to process patent applications in an 
efficient and timely manner, with a view to avoiding unreasonable or unnecessary 
delays. 
 
2. 
A Party may provide procedures for a patent applicant to request to 
expedite the examination of its patent application. 
 
3. 
If there are unreasonable delays in a Party’s issuance of patents, that Party 
shall provide the means to, and at the request of the patent owner shall, adjust the 
term of the patent to compensate for such delays.36 
 
4. 
For the purposes of this Article, an unreasonable delay at least shall 
include a delay in the issuance of a patent of more than five years from the date of 
filing of the application in the territory of the Party, or three years after a request 
for examination of the application has been made, whichever is later.  A Party 
may exclude, from the determination of such delays, periods of time that do not 
                                            
36  Annex 18-D applies to this paragraph. 
18-24 
occur during the processing37 of, or the examination of, the patent application by 
the granting authority; periods of time that are not directly attributable38 to the 
granting authority; as well as periods of time that are attributable to the patent 
applicant.39 
 
 
Subsection B:  Measures Relating to Agricultural Chemical Products 
 
 
Article 18.47:  Protection of Undisclosed Test or Other Data for Agricultural 
Chemical Products 
 
1. 
If a Party requires, as a condition for granting marketing approval40 for a 
new agricultural chemical product, the submission of undisclosed test or other 
data concerning the safety and efficacy of the product,41 that Party shall not permit 
third persons, without the consent of the person that previously submitted such 
information, to market the same or a similar 42 product on the basis of that 
information or the marketing approval granted to the person that submitted such 
test or other data for at least 10 years43 from the date of marketing approval of the 
new agricultural chemical product in the territory of the Party. 
 
2. 
If a Party permits, as a condition of granting marketing approval for a new 
agricultural chemical product, the submission of evidence of a prior marketing 
approval of the product in another territory, that Party shall not permit third 
persons, without the consent of the person that previously submitted undisclosed 
                                            
37  For the purposes of this paragraph, a Party may interpret processing to mean initial 
administrative processing and administrative processing at the time of grant. 
 
38  A Party may treat delays “that are not directly attributable to the granting authority” as delays 
that are outside the direction or control of the granting authority. 
 
39  Notwithstanding Article 18.10 (Application of Chapter to Existing Subject Matter and Prior 
Acts), this Article shall apply to all patent applications filed after the date of entry into force of this 
Agreement for that Party, or the date two years after the signing of this Agreement, whichever is 
later for that Party. 
 
40  For the purposes of this Chapter, the term “marketing approval” is synonymous with “sanitary 
approval” under a Party’s law. 
. 
41  Each Party confirms that the obligations of this Article apply to cases in which the Party 
requires the submission of undisclosed test or other data concerning: (a) only the safety of the 
product, (b) only the efficacy of the product or (c) both. 
 
42  For greater certainty, for the purposes of this Section, an agricultural chemical product is 
“similar” to a previously approved agricultural chemical product if the marketing approval, or, in 
the alternative, the applicant’s request for such approval, of that similar agricultural chemical 
product is based upon the undisclosed test or other data concerning the safety and efficacy of the 
previously approved agricultural chemical product, or the prior approval of that previously 
approved product. 
 
43  For greater certainty, a Party may limit the period of protection under this Article to 10 years. 
18-25 
test or other data concerning the safety and efficacy of the product in support of 
that prior marketing approval, to market the same or a similar product based on 
that undisclosed test or other data, or other evidence of the prior marketing 
approval in the other territory, for at least 10 years from the date of marketing 
approval of the new agricultural chemical product in the territory of the Party. 
 
3. 
For the purposes of this Article, a new agricultural chemical product is one 
that contains44 a chemical entity that has not been previously approved in the 
territory of the Party for use in an agricultural chemical product. 
 
 
Subsection C: Measures Relating to Pharmaceutical Products 
 
 
Article 18.48:  Patent Term Adjustment for Unreasonable Curtailment 
 
1. 
Each Party shall make best efforts to process applications for marketing 
approval of pharmaceutical products in an efficient and timely manner, with a 
view to avoiding unreasonable or unnecessary delays. 
 
2. 
With respect to a pharmaceutical product45 that is subject to a patent, each 
Party shall make available an adjustment46 of the patent term to compensate the 
patent owner for unreasonable curtailment of the effective patent term as a result 
of the marketing approval process.47, 48 
 
3. 
For greater certainty, in implementing the obligations of this Article, each 
Party may provide for conditions and limitations, provided that the Party 
continues to give effect to this Article. 
 
4. 
With the objective of avoiding unreasonable curtailment of the effective 
patent term, a Party may adopt or maintain procedures that expedite the 
processing of marketing approval applications. 
                                            
44  For the purposes of this Article, a Party may treat “contain” as meaning utilise.  For greater 
certainty, for the purposes of this Article, a Party may treat “utilise” as requiring the new chemical 
entity to be primarily responsible for the product’s intended effect. 
 
45  A Party may comply with the obligations of this paragraph with respect to a pharmaceutical 
product or, alternatively, with respect to a pharmaceutical substance. 
 
46  For greater certainty, a Party may alternatively make available a period of additional sui generis 
protection to compensate for unreasonable curtailment of the effective patent term as a result of the 
marketing approval process.  The sui generis protection shall confer the rights conferred by the 
patent, subject to any conditions and limitations pursuant to paragraph 3. 
 
47  Notwithstanding Article 18.10 (Application of Chapter to Existing Subject Matter and Prior 
Acts), this Article shall apply to all applications for marketing approval filed after the date of entry 
into force of this Article for that Party. 
 
48  Annex 18-D applies to this paragraph. 
18-26 
 
 
Article 18.49:  Regulatory Review Exception 
 
 
Without prejudice to the scope of, and consistent with, Article 18.40 
(Exceptions), each Party shall adopt or maintain a regulatory review exception49 
for pharmaceutical products. 
 
 
Article 18.50:  Protection of Undisclosed Test or Other Data50 
 
1. 
(a) 
If a Party requires, as a condition for granting marketing approval 
for a new pharmaceutical product, the submission of undisclosed 
test or other data concerning the safety and efficacy of the 
product,51 that Party shall not permit third persons, without the 
consent of the person that previously submitted such information, 
to market the same or a similar52 product on the basis of:  
 
(i) 
that information; or 
 
(ii) 
the marketing approval granted to the person that submitted 
such information, 
 
for at least five years53 from the date of marketing approval of the 
new pharmaceutical product in the territory of the Party. 
 
(b) 
If a Party permits, as a condition of granting marketing approval 
for a new pharmaceutical product, the submission of evidence of 
prior marketing approval of the product in another territory, that 
Party shall not permit third persons, without the consent of a person 
that previously submitted such information concerning the safety 
                                            
49  For greater certainty, consistent with Article 18.40 (Exceptions), nothing prevents a Party from 
providing that regulatory review exceptions apply for purposes of regulatory reviews in that Party, 
in another country or both. 
 
50  Annex 18-B and Annex 18-C apply to paragraphs 1 and 2 of this Article. 
 
51  Each Party confirms that the obligations of this Article, and Article 18.51 (Biologics) apply to 
cases in which the Party requires the submission of undisclosed test or other data concerning: (a) 
only the safety of the product, (b) only the efficacy of the product or (c) both. 
 
52  For greater certainty, for the purposes of this Section, a pharmaceutical product is “similar” to a 
previously approved pharmaceutical product if the marketing approval, or, in the alternative, the 
applicant’s request for such approval, of that similar pharmaceutical product is based upon the 
undisclosed test or other data concerning the safety and efficacy of the previously approved 
pharmaceutical product, or the prior approval of that previously approved product. 
 
53  For greater certainty, a Party may limit the period of protection under paragraph 1 to five years, 
and the period of protection under Article 18.51.1(a) (Biologics) to eight years.  
18-27 
and efficacy of the product, to market a same or a similar product 
based on evidence relating to prior marketing approval in the other 
territory for at least five years from the date of marketing approval 
of the new pharmaceutical product in the territory of that Party.54 
 
2. 
Each Party shall:55 
 
(a) 
apply paragraph 1, mutatis mutandis, for a period of at least three 
years with respect to new clinical information submitted as 
required in support of a marketing approval of a previously 
approved pharmaceutical product covering a new indication, new 
formulation or new method of administration; or, alternatively, 
 
(b) 
apply paragraph 1, mutatis mutandis, for a period of at least five 
years to new pharmaceutical products that contain 56 a chemical 
entity that has not been previously approved in that Party.57 
 
3. 
Notwithstanding paragraphs 1 and 2 and Article 18.51 (Biologics), a Party 
may take measures to protect public health in accordance with: 
 
(a) 
the Declaration on TRIPS and Public Health; 
 
(b) 
any waiver of any provision of the TRIPS Agreement granted by 
WTO Members in accordance with the WTO Agreement to 
implement the Declaration on TRIPS and Public Health and that is 
in force between the Parties; or 
 
(c) 
any amendment of the TRIPS Agreement to implement the 
Declaration on TRIPS and Public Health that enters into force with 
respect to the Parties. 
 
 
                                            
54  Annex 18-D applies to this subparagraph. 
 
55  A Party that provides a period of at least eight years of protection pursuant to paragraph 1 is not 
required to apply paragraph 2. 
 
56  For the purposes of this Article, a Party may treat “contain” as meaning utilise. 
 
57  For the purposes of Article 18.50.2(b) (Protection of Undisclosed Test or Other Data), a Party 
may choose to protect only the undisclosed test or other data concerning the safety and efficacy 
relating to the chemical entity that has not been previously approved. 
18-28 
Article 18.51:  Biologics58 
 
1. 
With regard to protecting new biologics, a Party shall either: 
 
(a) 
with respect to the first marketing approval in a Party of a new 
pharmaceutical product that is or contains a biologic,59,60 provide 
effective market protection through the implementation of Article 
18.50.1 (Protection of Undisclosed Test or Other Data) and Article 
18.50.3, mutatis mutandis, for a period of at least eight years from 
the date of first marketing approval of that product in that Party; or, 
alternatively, 
 
(b) 
with respect to the first marketing approval in a Party of a new 
pharmaceutical product that is or contains a biologic, provide 
effective market protection:  
 
(i) 
through the implementation of Article 18.50.1 (Protection 
of Undisclosed Test or Other Data) and Article 18.50.3, 
mutatis mutandis, for a period of at least five years from the 
date of first marketing approval of that product in that Party, 
 
(ii) 
through other measures, and 
 
(iii) 
recognising that market circumstances also contribute to 
effective market protection 
 
   to deliver a comparable outcome in the market. 
 
2. 
For the purposes of this Section, each Party shall apply this Article to, at a 
minimum, a product that is, or, alternatively, contains, a protein produced using 
biotechnology processes, for use in human beings for the prevention, treatment, or 
cure of a disease or condition. 
 
                                            
58  Annex 18-B, Annex 18-C and Annex 18-D apply to this Article. 
 
59  Nothing requires a Party to extend the protection of this paragraph to: 
 
(a) 
any second or subsequent marketing approval of such a pharmaceutical product; or 
 
(b) a pharmaceutical product that is or contains a previously approved biologic. 
 
60  Each Party may provide that an applicant may request approval of a pharmaceutical product 
that is or contains a biologic under the procedures set forth in Article 18.50.1(a) (Protection of 
Undisclosed Test or Other Data) and Article 18.50.1(b) within five years of the date of entry into 
force of this Agreement for that Party, provided that other pharmaceutical products in the same 
class of products have been approved by that Party under the procedures set forth in Article 
18.50.1(a) and Article 18.50.1(b) before the date of entry into force of this Agreement for that 
Party. 
18-29 
3. 
Recognising that international and domestic regulation of new 
pharmaceutical products that are or contain a biologic is in a formative stage and 
that market circumstances may evolve over time, the Parties shall consult after 10 
years from the date of entry into force of this Agreement, or as otherwise decided 
by the Commission, to review the period of exclusivity provided in paragraph 1 
and the scope of application provided in paragraph 2, with a view to providing 
effective incentives for the development of new pharmaceutical products that are 
or contain a biologic, as well as with a view to facilitating the timely availability 
of follow-on biosimilars, and to ensuring that the scope of application remains 
consistent with international developments regarding approval of additional 
categories of new pharmaceutical products that are or contain a biologic. 
 
 
Article 18.52:  Definition of New Pharmaceutical Product 
 
For the purposes of Article 18.50.1 (Protection of Undisclosed Test or 
Other Data), a new pharmaceutical product means a pharmaceutical product 
that does not contain61 a chemical entity that has been previously approved in that 
Party.   
 
 
Article 18.53:  Measures Relating to the Marketing of Certain 
Pharmaceutical Products 
 
1. 
If a Party permits, as a condition of approving the marketing of a 
pharmaceutical product, persons, other than the person originally submitting the 
safety and efficacy information, to rely on evidence or information concerning the 
safety and efficacy of a product that was previously approved, such as evidence of 
prior marketing approval by the Party or in another territory, that Party shall 
provide: 
 
(a) 
a system to provide notice to a patent holder62 or to allow for a 
patent holder to be notified prior to the marketing of such a 
pharmaceutical product, that such other person is seeking to market 
that product during the term of an applicable patent claiming the 
approved product or its approved method of use; 
 
(b) 
adequate time and opportunity for such a patent holder to seek, 
prior to the marketing 63  of an allegedly infringing product, 
available remedies in subparagraph (c); and 
                                            
61  For the purposes of this Article, a Party may treat “contain” as meaning utilise. 
 
62  For greater certainty, for the purposes of this Article, a Party may provide that a “patent holder” 
includes a patent licensee or the authorised holder of marketing approval. 
 
63  For the purposes of paragraph 1(b), a Party may treat “marketing” as commencing at the time of 
listing for purposes of the reimbursement of pharmaceutical products pursuant to a national 
18-30 
 
(c) 
procedures, such as judicial or administrative proceedings, and 
expeditious remedies, such as preliminary injunctions or equivalent 
effective provisional measures, for the timely resolution of disputes 
concerning the validity or infringement of an applicable patent 
claiming an approved pharmaceutical product or its approved 
method of use. 
 
2. 
As an alternative to paragraph 1, a Party shall instead adopt or maintain a 
system other than judicial proceedings that precludes, based upon patent-related 
information submitted to the marketing approval authority by a patent holder or 
the applicant for marketing approval, or based on direct coordination between the 
marketing approval authority and the patent office, the issuance of marketing 
approval to any third person seeking to market a pharmaceutical product subject 
to a patent claiming that product, unless by consent or acquiescence of the patent 
holder. 
 
 
Article 18.54:  Alteration of Period of Protection 
 
Subject to Article 18.50.3 (Protection of Undisclosed Test or Other Data), 
if a product is subject to a system of marketing approval in the territory of a Party 
pursuant to Article 18.47 (Protection of Undisclosed Test or Other Data for 
Agricultural Chemical Products), Article 18.50 or Article 18.51 (Biologics) and is 
also covered by a patent in the territory of that Party, the Party shall not alter the 
period of protection that it provides pursuant to Article 18.47, Article 18.50 or 
Article 18.51 in the event that the patent protection terminates on a date earlier 
than the end of the period of protection specified in Article 18.47, Article 18.50 or 
Article 18.51. 
 
 
Section G: Industrial Designs 
 
 
Article 18.55:  Protection 
 
1. 
Each Party shall ensure adequate and effective protection of industrial 
designs and also confirms that protection for industrial designs is available for 
designs: 
 
(a) 
embodied in a part of an article; or, alternatively, 
 
(b) 
having a particular regard, where appropriate, to a part of an article 
in the context of the article as a whole. 
 
                                                                                                                        
healthcare programme operated by a Party and inscribed in the Appendix to Annex 26-A 
(Transparency and Procedural Fairness for Pharmaceutical Products and Medical Devices). 
18-31 
2. 
This Article is subject to Articles 25 and 26 of the TRIPS Agreement. 
 
 
Article 18.56:  Improving Industrial Design Systems 
 
The Parties recognise the importance of improving the quality and 
efficiency of their respective industrial design registration systems, as well as 
facilitating the process of cross-border acquisition of rights in their respective 
industrial design systems, including giving due consideration to ratifying or 
acceding to the Geneva Act of the Hague Agreement Concerning the International 
Registration of Industrial Designs, done at Geneva, July 2, 1999. 
 
 
Section H: Copyright and Related Rights 
 
 
Article 18.57:  Definitions 
 
For the purposes of Article 18.58 (Right of Reproduction) and Article 
18.60 (Right of Distribution) through Article 18.70 (Collective Management), the 
following definitions apply with respect to performers and producers of 
phonograms: 
 
broadcasting means the transmission by wireless means for public reception of 
sounds or of images and sounds or of the representations thereof; such 
transmission by satellite is also “broadcasting”; transmission of encrypted signals 
is “broadcasting” if the means for decrypting are provided to the public by the 
broadcasting organisation or with its consent; 
 
communication to the public of a performance or a phonogram means the 
transmission to the public by any medium, other than by broadcasting, of sounds 
of a performance or the sounds or the representations of sounds fixed in a 
phonogram; 
 
fixation means the embodiment of sounds, or of the representations thereof, from 
which they can be perceived, reproduced, or communicated through a device; 
 
performers means actors, singers, musicians, dancers, and other persons who act, 
sing, deliver, declaim, play in, interpret, or otherwise perform literary or artistic 
works or expressions of folklore; 
 
phonogram means the fixation of the sounds of a performance or of other sounds, 
or of a representation of sounds, other than in the form of a fixation incorporated 
in a cinematographic or other audio-visual work; 
 
18-32 
producer of a phonogram means a person that takes the initiative and has the 
responsibility for the first fixation of the sounds of a performance or other sounds, 
or the representations of sounds; and 
 
publication of a performance or phonogram means the offering of copies of the 
performance or the phonogram to the public, with the consent of the right holder, 
and provided that copies are offered to the public in reasonable quantity. 
 
 
Article 18.58:  Right of Reproduction 
 
 
Each Party shall provide 64  to authors, performers and producers of 
phonograms65 the exclusive right to authorise or prohibit all reproduction of their 
works, performances or phonograms in any manner or form, including in 
electronic form. 
 
 
Article 18.59:  Right of Communication to the Public 
 
Without prejudice to Article 11(1)(ii), Article 11bis(1)(i) and (ii), Article 
11ter(1)(ii), Article 14(1)(ii), and Article 14bis(1) of the Berne Convention, each 
Party shall provide to authors the exclusive right to authorise or prohibit the 
communication to the public of their works, by wire or wireless means, including 
the making available to the public of their works in such a way that members of 
the public may access these works from a place and at a time individually chosen 
by them.66 
 
 
Article 18.60:  Right of Distribution 
 
Each Party shall provide to authors, performers and producers of 
phonograms the exclusive right to authorise or prohibit the making available to 
the public of the original and copies 67  of their works, performances and 
phonograms through sale or other transfer of ownership. 
                                            
64  For greater certainty, the Parties understand that it is a matter for each Party’s law to prescribe 
that works, performances or phonograms in general or any specified categories of works, 
performances and phonograms are not protected by copyright or related rights unless the work, 
performance or phonogram has been fixed in some material form. 
 
65  References to “authors, performers, and producers of phonograms” refer also to any of their 
successors in interest. 
 
66  The Parties understand that the mere provision of physical facilities for enabling or making a 
communication does not in itself amount to communication within the meaning of this Chapter or 
the Berne Convention.  The Parties further understand that nothing in this Article precludes a Party 
from applying Article 11bis(2) of the Berne Convention. 
 
67  The expressions “copies” and “original and copies”, that are subject to the right of distribution 
in this Article, refer exclusively to fixed copies that can be put into circulation as tangible objects. 
18-33 
 
 
Article 18.61:  No Hierarchy  
 
Each Party shall provide that in cases in which authorisation is needed from 
both the author of a work embodied in a phonogram and a performer or producer 
that owns rights in the phonogram: 
 
(a) 
the need for the authorisation of the author does not cease to exist 
because the authorisation of the performer or producer is also 
required; and 
 
(b) 
the need for the authorisation of the performer or producer does not 
cease to exist because the authorisation of the author is also required. 
 
 
Article 18.62:  Related Rights 
 
1. 
Each Party shall accord the rights provided for in this Chapter with respect 
to performers and producers of phonograms: to the performers and producers of 
phonograms that are nationals 68  of another Party; and to performances or 
phonograms first published or first fixed69 in the territory of another Party.70  A 
performance or phonogram shall be considered first published in the territory of a 
Party if it is published in the territory of that Party within 30 days of its original 
publication. 
 
2. 
Each Party shall provide to performers the exclusive right to authorise or 
prohibit: 
 
(a) 
the broadcasting and communication to the public of their unfixed 
performances, unless the performance is already a broadcast 
performance; and 
 
(b) 
the fixation of their unfixed performances. 
 
                                                                                                                        
 
68  For the purposes of determining criteria for eligibility under this Article, with respect to 
performers, a Party may treat “nationals” as those who would meet the criteria for eligibility under 
Article 3 of the WPPT. 
  
69  For the purposes of this Article, fixation means the finalisation of the master tape or its 
equivalent. 
 
70  For greater certainty, in this paragraph with respect to performances or phonograms first 
published or first fixed in the territory of a Party, a Party may apply the criterion of publication, or 
alternatively, the criterion of fixation, or both.  For greater certainty, consistent with Article 18.8 
(National Treatment), each Party shall accord to performances and phonograms first published or 
first fixed in the territory of another Party treatment no less favourable than it accords to 
performances or phonograms first published or first fixed in its own territory.  
18-34 
3. 
(a) 
Each Party shall provide to performers and producers of 
phonograms the exclusive right to authorise or prohibit the 
broadcasting or any communication to the public of their 
performances or phonograms, by wire or wireless means,71, 72 and 
the making available to the public of those performances or 
phonograms in such a way that members of the public may access 
them from a place and at a time individually chosen by them. 
 
(b) 
Notwithstanding subparagraph (a) and Article 18.65 (Limitations 
and Exceptions), the application of the right referred to in 
subparagraph (a) to analog transmissions and non-interactive free 
over-the-air broadcasts, and exceptions or limitations to this right 
for those activities, is a matter of each Party’s law.73 
 
 
Article 18.63:  Term of Protection for Copyright and Related Rights 
 
Each Party shall provide that in cases in which the term of protection of a 
work, performance or phonogram is to be calculated:74 
 
(a) 
on the basis of the life of a natural person, the term shall be not less 
than the life of the author and 70 years after the author’s death;75 
and 
 
(b) 
on a basis other than the life of a natural person, the term shall be: 
                                            
71  With respect to broadcasting and communication to the public, a Party may satisfy the 
obligation by applying Article 15(1) and Article 15(4) of the WPPT and may also apply Article 
15(2) of the WPPT, provided that it is done in a manner consistent with that Party’s obligations 
under Article 18.8 (National Treatment). 
   
72  For greater certainty, the obligation under this paragraph does not include broadcasting or 
communication to the public, by wire or wireless means, of the sounds or representations of 
sounds fixed in a phonogram that are incorporated in a cinematographic or other audio-visual 
work. 
 
73  For the purposes of this subparagraph the Parties understand that a Party may provide for the 
retransmission of non-interactive, free over-the-air broadcasts, provided that these retransmissions 
are lawfully permitted by that Party’s government communications authority; any entity engaging 
in these retransmissions complies with the relevant rules, orders or regulations of that authority; 
and these retransmissions do not include those delivered and accessed over the Internet.  For 
greater certainty this footnote does not limit a Party’s ability to avail itself of this subparagraph. 
 
74  For greater certainty, in implementing this Article, nothing prevents a Party from promoting 
certainty for the legitimate use and exploitation of a work, performance or phonogram during its 
term of protection, consistent with Article 18.65 (Limitations and Exceptions) and that Party’s 
international obligations. 
 
75  The Parties understand that if a Party provides its nationals a term of copyright protection that 
exceeds life of the author plus 70 years, nothing in this Article or Article 18.8 (National Treatment) 
shall preclude that Party from applying Article 7(8) of the Berne Convention with respect to the 
term in excess of the term provided in this subparagraph of protection for works of another Party. 
18-35 
 
(i) 
not less than 70 years from the end of the calendar year of 
the first authorised publication76 of the work, performance 
or phonogram; or 
 
(ii) 
failing such authorised publication within 25 years from the 
creation of the work, performance or phonogram, not less 
than 70 years from the end of the calendar year of the 
creation of the work, performance or phonogram.77 
 
 
Article 18.64:  Application of Article 18 of the Berne Convention and Article 
14.6 of the TRIPS Agreement  
 
Each Party shall apply Article 18 of the Berne Convention and Article 14.6 
of the TRIPS Agreement, mutatis mutandis, to works, performances and 
phonograms, and the rights in and protections afforded to that subject matter as 
required by this Section. 
 
 
Article 18.65:  Limitations and Exceptions 
 
1. 
With respect to this Section, each Party shall confine limitations or 
exceptions to exclusive rights to certain special cases that do not conflict with a 
normal exploitation of the work, performance or phonogram, and do not 
unreasonably prejudice the legitimate interests of the right holder. 
 
2. 
This Article does not reduce or extend the scope of applicability of the 
limitations and exceptions permitted by the TRIPS Agreement, the Berne 
Convention, the WCT or the WPPT. 
 
 
Article 18.66:  Balance in Copyright and Related Rights Systems 
 
Each Party shall endeavour to achieve an appropriate balance in its 
copyright and related rights system, among other things by means of limitations or 
exceptions that are consistent with Article 18.65 (Limitations and Exceptions), 
including those for the digital environment, giving due consideration to legitimate 
purposes such as, but not limited to: criticism; comment; news reporting; 
teaching, scholarship, research, and other similar purposes; and facilitating access 
                                            
76  For greater certainty, for the purposes of subparagraph (b), if a Party’s law provides for the 
calculation of term from fixation rather than from the first authorised publication, that Party may 
continue to calculate the term from fixation. 
 
77  For greater certainty, a Party may calculate a term of protection for an anonymous or 
pseudonymous work or a work of joint authorship in accordance with Article 7(3) or Article 7bis 
of the Berne Convention, provided that the Party implements the corresponding numerical term of 
protection required under this Article. 
18-36 
to published works for persons who are blind, visually impaired or otherwise print 
disabled.78, 79  
 
 
Article 18.67:  Contractual Transfers 
 
Each Party shall provide that for copyright and related rights, any person 
acquiring or holding any economic right80 in a work, performance or phonogram: 
 
(a) 
may freely and separately transfer that right by contract; and 
 
(b) 
by virtue of contract, including contracts of employment 
underlying the creation of works, performances or phonograms, 
shall be able to exercise that right in that person’s own name and 
enjoy fully the benefits derived from that right.81 
 
 
Article 18.68:  Technological Protection Measures (TPMs)82 
 
1. 
In order to provide adequate legal protection and effective legal remedies 
against the circumvention of effective technological measures that authors, 
performers, and producers of phonograms use in connection with the exercise of 
their rights and that restrict unauthorised acts in respect of their works, 
performances, and phonograms,  each Party shall provide that any person that: 
 
(a) 
knowingly, or having reasonable grounds to know,83 circumvents 
without authority any effective technological measure that controls 
access to a protected work, performance, or phonogram;84 or   
                                            
78  As recognised by the Marrakesh Treaty to Facilitate Access to Published Works for Persons 
Who Are Blind, Visually Impaired, or Otherwise Print Disabled, done at Marrakesh, June 27, 2013 
(Marrakesh Treaty).  The Parties recognise that some Parties facilitate the availability of works in 
accessible formats for beneficiaries beyond the requirements of the Marrakesh Treaty. 
 
79  For greater certainty, a use that has commercial aspects may in appropriate circumstances be 
considered to have a legitimate purpose under Article 18.65 (Limitations and Exceptions). 
 
80  For greater certainty, this provision does not affect the exercise of moral rights. 
 
81  Nothing in this Article affects a Party’s ability to establish: (i) which specific contracts 
underlying the creation of works, performances or phonograms shall, in the absence of a written 
agreement, result in a transfer of economic rights by operation of law; and (ii) reasonable limits to 
protect the interests of the original right holders, taking into account the legitimate interests of the 
transferees. 
 
82  Nothing in this Agreement requires a Party to restrict the importation or domestic sale of a 
device that does not render effective a technological measure the only purpose of which is to 
control market segmentation for legitimate physical copies of a cinematographic film, and is not 
otherwise a violation of its law. 
 
18-37 
 
(b) 
manufactures, imports, distributes,85 offers for sale or rental to the 
public, or otherwise provides devices, products, or components, or 
offers to the public or provides services, that: 
 
(i) 
are promoted, advertised, or otherwise marketed by that 
person 86 for the purpose of circumventing any effective 
technological measure; 
 
(ii) 
have only a limited commercially significant purpose or use 
other than to circumvent any effective technological 
measure;87 or 
 
(iii) 
are primarily designed, produced, or performed for the 
purpose of circumventing any effective technological 
measure, 
 
is liable and subject to the remedies provided for in Article 18.74 (Civil and 
Administrative Procedures and Remedies). 
 
Each Party shall provide for criminal procedures and penalties to be applied if any 
person is found to have engaged wilfully88 and for the purposes of commercial 
advantage or financial gain89 in any of the above activities.90  
                                                                                                                        
83  For the purposes of this subparagraph, a Party may provide that reasonable grounds to know 
may be demonstrated through reasonable evidence, taking into account the facts and circumstances 
surrounding the alleged illegal act. 
 
84  For greater certainty, no Party is required to impose civil or criminal liability under this 
subparagraph for a person that circumvents any effective technological measure that protects any 
of the exclusive rights of copyright or related rights in a protected work, performance or 
phonogram, but does not control access to such that work, performance or phonogram. 
 
85  A Party may provide that the obligations described in this subparagraph with respect to 
manufacturing, importation, and distribution apply only in cases in which those activities are 
undertaken for sale or rental, or if those activities prejudice the interests of the right holder of the 
copyright or related right. 
 
86  The Parties understand that this provision still applies in cases in which the person promotes, 
advertises, or markets through the services of a third person. 
 
87  A Party may comply with this paragraph if the conduct referred to in this subparagraph does not 
have a commercially significant purpose or use other than to circumvent an effective technological 
measure. 
 
88  For greater certainty, for purposes of this Article and Article 18.69 (RMI), wilfulness contains a 
knowledge element. 
 
89  For greater certainty, for purposes of this Article, Article 18.69 (RMI) and Article 18.77 
(Criminal Procedures and Penalties), the Parties understand that a Party may treat “financial gain” 
as “commercial purposes”. 
18-38 
 
A Party may provide that the criminal procedures and penalties do not apply to a 
non-profit library, museum, archive, educational institution, or public non-
commercial broadcasting entity.  A Party may also provide that the remedies 
provided for in Article 18.74 (Civil and Administrative Procedures and Remedies) 
do not apply to any of the same entities provided that the above activities are 
carried out in good faith without knowledge that the conduct is prohibited. 
 
2. 
In implementing paragraph 1, no Party shall be obligated to require that 
the design of, or the design and selection of parts and components for, a consumer 
electronics, telecommunications, or computing product provide for a response to 
any particular technological measure, provided that the product does not 
otherwise violate a measure implementing paragraph 1.  
 
3. 
Each Party shall provide that a violation of a measure implementing this 
Article is independent of any infringement that might occur under the Party’s law 
on copyright and related rights.91 
 
4. 
With regard to measures implementing paragraph 1: 
 
(a) 
a Party may provide certain limitations and exceptions to the 
measures implementing paragraph 1(a) or paragraph 1(b) in order 
to enable non-infringing uses if there is an actual or likely adverse 
impact of those measures on those non-infringing uses, as 
determined through a legislative, regulatory, or administrative 
process in accordance with the Party’s law, giving due 
consideration to evidence when presented in that process, 
including with respect to whether appropriate and effective 
measures have been taken by rights holders to enable the 
beneficiaries to enjoy the limitations and exceptions to copyright 
and related rights under that Party’s law;92 
 
(b) 
any limitations or exceptions to a measure that implements 
paragraph 1(b) shall be permitted only to enable the legitimate use 
of a limitation or exception permissible under this Article by its 
                                                                                                                        
90  For greater certainty, no Party is required to impose liability under this Article and Article 18.69 
(RMI) for actions taken by that Party or a third person acting with the authorisation or consent of 
that Party. 
  
91  For greater certainty, a Party is not required to treat the criminal act of circumvention set forth 
in paragraph 1(a) as an independent violation, where the Party criminally penalises such acts 
through other means. 
 
92  For greater certainty, nothing in this provision requires a Party to make a new determination via 
the legislative, regulatory, or administrative process with respect to limitations and exceptions to 
the legal protection of effective technological measures: (i) previously established pursuant to 
trade agreements in force between two or more Parties; or (ii) previously implemented by the 
Parties, provided that such limitations and exceptions are otherwise consistent with this paragraph. 
18-39 
intended beneficiaries 93  and does not authorise the making 
available of devices, products, components, or services beyond 
those intended beneficiaries;94 and 
 
(c) 
a Party shall not, by providing limitations and exceptions under 
paragraph 4(a) and paragraph 4(b), undermine the adequacy of 
that Party’s legal system for the protection of effective 
technological measures, or the effectiveness of legal remedies 
against the circumvention of such measures, that authors, 
performers, or producers of phonograms use in connection with 
the exercise of their rights, or that restrict unauthorised acts in 
respect of their works, performances or phonograms, as provided 
for in this Chapter. 
 
5. 
Effective technological measure means any effective 95  technology, 
device, or component that, in the normal course of its operation, controls access to 
a protected work, performance, or phonogram, or protects copyright or related 
rights related to a work, performance or phonogram. 
 
 
Article 18.69:  Rights Management Information (RMI)96 
 
1. 
In order to provide adequate and effective legal remedies to protect RMI: 
 
(a) 
each Party shall provide that any person that, without authority, and 
knowing, or having reasonable grounds to know, that it would 
induce, enable, facilitate or conceal an infringement of the 
copyright or related right of authors, performers or producers of 
phonograms: 
 
 
 
(i) 
knowingly97 removes or alters any RMI; 
 
                                            
93  For greater certainty, a Party may provide an exception to paragraph 1(b) without providing a 
corresponding exception to paragraph 1(a), provided that the exception to paragraph 1(b) is limited 
to enabling a legitimate use that is within the scope of limitations or exceptions to paragraph 1(a) 
as provided under this subparagraph. 
   
94  For the purposes of interpreting paragraph 4(b) only, paragraph 1(a) should be read to apply to 
all effective technological measures as defined in paragraph 5, mutatis mutandis. 
 
95  For greater certainty, a technological measure that can, in a usual case, be circumvented 
accidentally is not an “effective” technological measure. 
  
96  A Party may comply with the obligations in this Article by providing legal protection only to 
electronic RMI. 
  
97  For greater certainty, a Party may extend the protection afforded by this paragraph to 
circumstances in which a person engages without knowledge in the acts in sub-subparagraphs (i), 
(ii) and (iii), and to other related right holders. 
18-40 
(ii) 
knowingly distributes or imports for distribution RMI 
knowing that the RMI has been altered without authority;98 
or 
 
(iii) 
knowingly distributes, imports for distribution, broadcasts, 
communicates or makes available to the public copies of 
works, performances or phonograms, knowing that RMI has 
been removed or altered without authority, 
 
is liable and subject to the remedies set out in Article 18.74 (Civil and 
Administrative Procedures and Remedies). 
 
Each Party shall provide for criminal procedures and penalties to be applied if any 
person is found to have engaged wilfully and for purposes of commercial 
advantage or financial gain in any of the above activities. 
 
A Party may provide that the criminal procedures and penalties do not apply to a 
non-profit library, museum, archive, educational institution or public non-
commercial broadcasting entity.99 
 
2. 
For greater certainty, nothing prevents a Party from excluding from a 
measure that implements paragraph 1 a lawfully authorised activity that is carried 
out for the purpose of law enforcement, essential security interests or other related 
governmental purposes, such as the performance of a statutory function. 
 
3. 
For greater certainty, nothing in this Article shall obligate a Party to 
require a right holder in a work, performance or phonogram to attach RMI to 
copies of the work, performance or phonogram, or to cause RMI to appear in 
connection with a communication of the work, performance or phonogram to the 
public. 
 
4. 
RMI means: 
 
(a) 
information that identifies a work, performance or phonogram, the 
author of the work, the performer of the performance or the 
producer of the phonogram; or the owner of any right in the work, 
performance or phonogram; 
 
(b) 
information about the terms and conditions of the use of the work, 
performance or phonogram; or 
                                            
98  A Party may comply with its obligations under this sub-subparagraph by providing for civil 
judicial proceedings concerning the enforcement of moral rights under its copyright law.  A Party 
may also meet its obligation under this sub-subparagraph, if it provides effective protection for 
original compilations, provided that the acts described in this sub-subparagraph are treated as 
infringements of copyright in those original compilations. 
 
99  For greater certainty, a Party may treat a broadcasting entity established without a profit-making 
purpose under its law as a public non-commercial broadcasting entity. 
18-41 
 
(c) 
any numbers or codes that represent the information referred to in 
subparagraphs (a) and (b), 
 
if any of these items is attached to a copy of the work, performance or 
phonogram or appears in connection with the communication or making 
available of a work, performance or phonogram to the public. 
 
 
Article 18.70:  Collective Management 
 
The Parties recognise the important role of collective management 
societies for copyright and related rights in collecting and distributing royalties100 
based on practices that are fair, efficient, transparent and accountable, which may 
include appropriate record keeping and reporting mechanisms. 
 
 
Section I: Enforcement 
  
 
Article 18.71:  General Obligations 
 
1. 
Each Party shall ensure that enforcement procedures as specified in this 
Section are available under its law101 so as to permit effective action against any 
act of infringement of intellectual property rights covered by this Chapter, 
including expeditious remedies to prevent infringements and remedies that 
constitute a deterrent to future infringements. 102   These procedures shall be 
applied in such a manner as to avoid the creation of barriers to legitimate trade 
and to provide for safeguards against their abuse. 
 
2. 
Each Party confirms that the enforcement procedures set forth in Article 
18.74 (Civil and Administrative Procedures and Remedies), Article 18.75 
(Provisional Measures) and Article 18.77 (Criminal Procedures and Penalties) 
shall be available to the same extent with respect to acts of trademark 
infringement, as well as copyright or related rights infringement, in the digital 
environment. 
 
3. 
Each Party shall ensure that its procedures concerning the enforcement of 
intellectual property rights are fair and equitable.  These procedures shall not be 
unnecessarily complicated or costly, or entail unreasonable time-limits or 
unwarranted delays. 
                                            
100  For greater certainty, royalties may include equitable remuneration. 
 
101  For greater certainty, “law” is not limited to legislation. 
 
102  For greater certainty, and subject to Article 44 of the TRIPS Agreement and the provisions of 
this Agreement, each Party confirms that it makes such remedies available with respect to 
enterprises, regardless of whether the enterprises are private or state-owned. 
18-42 
 
4. 
This Section does not create any obligation: 
 
(a) 
to put in place a judicial system for the enforcement of intellectual 
property rights distinct from that for the enforcement of law in 
general, nor does it affect the capacity of each Party to enforce its 
law in general; or 
 
(b) 
with respect to the distribution of resources as between the 
enforcement of intellectual property rights and the enforcement of 
law in general. 
 
5. 
In implementing the provisions of this Section in its intellectual property 
system, each Party shall take into account the need for proportionality between the 
seriousness of the infringement of the intellectual property right and the 
applicable remedies and penalties, as well as the interests of third parties. 
 
 
Article 18.72:  Presumptions 
 
1. 
In civil, criminal and, if applicable, administrative proceedings involving 
copyright or related rights, each Party shall provide for a presumption103 that, in 
the absence of proof to the contrary:  
 
(a) 
the person whose name is indicated in the usual manner104 as the 
author, performer or producer of the work, performance or 
phonogram, or if applicable the publisher, is the designated right 
holder in that work, performance or phonogram; and 
 
(b) 
the copyright or related right subsists in such subject matter. 
 
2. 
In connection with the commencement of a civil, administrative or 
criminal enforcement proceeding involving a registered trademark that has been 
substantively examined by its competent authority, each Party shall provide that 
the trademark be considered prima facie valid.  
 
3. 
In connection with the commencement of a civil or administrative 
enforcement proceeding involving a patent that has been substantively examined 
and granted105 by the competent authority of a Party, that Party shall provide that 
                                            
103  For greater certainty, a Party may implement this Article on the basis of sworn statements or 
documents having evidentiary value, such as statutory declarations.  A Party may also provide that 
these presumptions are rebuttable presumptions that may be rebutted by evidence to the contrary. 
 
104  For greater certainty, a Party may establish the means by which it shall determine what 
constitutes the “usual manner” for a particular physical support. 
 
105  For greater certainty, nothing in this Chapter prevents a Party from making available third 
party procedures in connection with its fulfilment of the obligations under paragraphs 2 and 3. 
18-43 
each claim in the patent be considered prima facie to satisfy the applicable criteria 
of patentability in the territory of the Party.106, 107 
 
 
Article 18.73:  Enforcement Practices with Respect to Intellectual Property 
Rights 
 
1. 
Each Party shall provide that final judicial decisions and administrative 
rulings of general application pertaining to the enforcement of intellectual 
property rights: 
 
(a) 
preferably are in writing and state any relevant findings of fact and 
the reasoning or the legal basis on which the decisions and rulings 
are based; and 
 
(b) 
are published108 or, if publication is not practicable, otherwise made 
available to the public in a national language in such a manner as to 
enable interested persons and Parties to become acquainted with 
them. 
  
2. 
Each Party recognises the importance of collecting and analysing 
statistical data and other relevant information concerning infringements of 
intellectual property rights as well as collecting information on best practices to 
prevent and combat infringements. 
 
3. 
Each Party shall publish or otherwise make available to the public 
information on its efforts to provide effective enforcement of intellectual property 
rights in its civil, administrative and criminal systems, such as statistical 
information that the Party may collect for such purposes. 
 
 
                                                                                                                        
 
106  For greater certainty, if a Party provides its administrative authorities with the exclusive 
authority to determine the validity of a registered trademark or patent, nothing in paragraphs 2 and 
3 shall prevent that Party’s competent authority from suspending enforcement procedures until the 
validity of the registered trademark or patent is determined by the administrative authority.  In 
those validity procedures, the party challenging the validity of the registered trademark or patent 
shall be required to prove that the registered trademark or patent is not valid.  Notwithstanding this 
requirement, a Party may require the trademark holder to provide evidence of first use. 
 
107  A Party may provide that this paragraph applies only to those patents that have been applied 
for, examined and granted after the entry into force of this Agreement for that Party. 
 
108  For greater certainty, a Party may satisfy the requirement for publication by making the 
decision or ruling available to the public on the Internet. 
18-44 
Article 18.74:  Civil and Administrative Procedures and Remedies 
 
1. 
Each Party shall make available to right holders civil judicial procedures 
concerning the enforcement of any intellectual property right covered in this 
Chapter.109  
 
2. 
Each Party shall provide that its judicial authorities have the authority to 
order injunctive relief that conforms to Article 44 of the TRIPS Agreement, 
including to prevent goods that involve the infringement of an intellectual 
property right under the law of the Party providing that relief from entering into 
the channels of commerce. 
 
3. 
Each Party shall provide110 that, in civil judicial proceedings, its judicial 
authorities have the authority at least to order the infringer to pay the right holder 
damages adequate to compensate for the injury the right holder has suffered 
because of an infringement of that person’s intellectual property right by an 
infringer who knowingly, or with reasonable grounds to know, engaged in 
infringing activity. 
 
4. 
In determining the amount of damages under paragraph 3, each Party’s 
judicial authorities shall have the authority to consider, among other things, any 
legitimate measure of value the right holder submits, which may include lost 
profits, the value of the infringed goods or services measured by the market price, 
or the suggested retail price. 
 
5. 
At least in cases of copyright or related rights infringement and trademark 
counterfeiting, each Party shall provide that, in civil judicial proceedings, its 
judicial authorities have the authority to order the infringer, at least in cases 
described in paragraph 3, to pay the right holder the infringer’s profits that are 
attributable to the infringement.111 
 
6. 
In civil judicial proceedings with respect to the infringement of copyright 
or related rights protecting works, phonograms or performances, each Party shall 
establish or maintain a system that provides for one or more of the following: 
 
                                            
109  For the purposes of this Article, the term “right holders” shall include those authorised 
licensees, federations and associations that have the legal standing and authority to assert such 
rights.  The term “authorised licensee” shall include the exclusive licensee of any one or more of 
the exclusive intellectual property rights encompassed in a given intellectual property. 
 
110  A Party may also provide that the right holder may not be entitled to any of the remedies set 
out in paragraphs 3, 5 and 7 if there is a finding of non-use of a trademark.  For greater certainty, 
there is no obligation for a Party to provide for the possibility of any of the remedies in paragraphs 
3, 5, 6 and 7 to be ordered in parallel. 
 
111  A Party may comply with this paragraph through presuming those profits to be the damages 
referred to in paragraph 3.  
18-45 
(a) 
pre-established damages, which shall be available on the election of 
the right holder; or 
 
(b) 
additional damages.112 
 
7. 
In civil judicial proceedings with respect to trademark counterfeiting, each 
Party shall also establish or maintain a system that provides for one or more of the 
following: 
 
(a) 
pre-established damages, which shall be available on the election of 
the right holder; or 
 
(b) 
additional damages.113 
 
8. 
Pre-established damages under paragraphs 6 and 7 shall be set out in an 
amount that would be sufficient to compensate the right holder for the harm 
caused by the infringement, and with a view to deterring future infringements. 
 
9. 
In awarding additional damages under paragraphs 6 and 7, judicial 
authorities shall have the authority to award such additional damages as they 
consider appropriate, having regard to all relevant matters, including the nature of 
the infringing conduct and the need to deter similar infringements in the future. 
 
10. 
Each Party shall provide that its judicial authorities, if appropriate, have 
the authority to order, at the conclusion of civil judicial proceedings concerning 
infringement of at least copyright or related rights, patents and trademarks, that 
the prevailing party be awarded payment by the losing party of court costs or fees 
and appropriate attorney’s fees, or any other expenses as provided for under the 
Party’s law. 
 
11. 
If a Party’s judicial or other authorities appoint a technical or other expert 
in a civil proceeding concerning the enforcement of an intellectual property right 
and require that the parties to the proceeding pay the costs of that expert, that 
Party should seek to ensure that those costs are reasonable and related 
appropriately, among other things, to the quantity and nature of work to be 
performed and do not unreasonably deter recourse to such proceedings. 
 
12. 
Each Party shall provide that in civil judicial proceedings: 
 
(a) 
at least with respect to pirated copyright goods and counterfeit 
trademark goods, its judicial authorities have the authority, at the 
right holder’s request, to order that the infringing goods be 
destroyed, 
except 
in 
exceptional 
circumstances, 
without 
compensation of any sort; 
                                            
112  For greater certainty, additional damages may include exemplary or punitive damages. 
 
113  For greater certainty, additional damages may include exemplary or punitive damages. 
18-46 
 
(b) 
its judicial authorities have the authority to order that materials and 
implements that have been used in the manufacture or creation of 
the infringing goods be, without undue delay and without 
compensation of any sort, destroyed or disposed of outside the 
channels of commerce in such a manner as to minimise the risk of 
further infringement; and 
 
(c) 
in regard to counterfeit trademark goods, the simple removal of the 
trademark unlawfully affixed is not sufficient, other than in 
exceptional circumstances, to permit the release of goods into the 
channels of commerce. 
 
13. 
Without prejudice to its law governing privilege, the protection of 
confidentiality of information sources or the processing of personal data, each 
Party shall provide that, in civil judicial proceedings concerning the enforcement 
of an intellectual property right, its judicial authorities have the authority, on a 
justified request of the right holder, to order the infringer or, in the alternative, the 
alleged infringer to provide to the right holder or to the judicial authorities, at least 
for the purpose of collecting evidence, relevant information as provided for in its 
applicable laws and regulations that the infringer or alleged infringer possesses or 
controls.  The information may include information regarding any person involved 
in any aspect of the infringement or alleged infringement and the means of 
production or the channels of distribution of the infringing or allegedly infringing 
goods or services, including the identification of third persons alleged to be 
involved in the production and distribution of the goods or services and of their 
channels of distribution. 
  
14. 
Each Party shall provide that in relation to a civil judicial proceeding 
concerning the enforcement of an intellectual property right, its judicial or other 
authorities have the authority to impose sanctions on a party, counsel, experts or 
other persons subject to the court’s jurisdiction for violation of judicial orders 
concerning the protection of confidential information produced or exchanged in 
that proceeding. 
 
15. 
Each Party shall ensure that its judicial authorities have the authority to 
order a party at whose request measures were taken and that has abused 
enforcement procedures with regard to intellectual property rights, including 
trademarks, geographical indications, patents, copyright and related rights and 
industrial designs, to provide to a party wrongfully enjoined or restrained 
adequate compensation for the injury suffered because of that abuse.  The judicial 
authorities shall also have the authority to order the applicant to pay the defendant 
expenses, which may include appropriate attorney’s fees. 
 
16. 
To the extent that any civil remedy can be ordered as a result of 
administrative procedures on the merits of a case, each Party shall provide that 
18-47 
those procedures conform to principles equivalent in substance to those set out in 
this Article. 
 
17. 
In civil judicial proceedings concerning the acts described in Article 18.68 
(TPMs) and Article 18.69 (RMI): 
 
(a) 
each Party shall provide that its judicial authorities have the 
authority at least to:114 
 
(i) 
impose provisional measures, including seizure or other 
taking into custody of devices and products suspected of 
being involved in the prohibited activity; 
 
(ii) 
order the type of damages available for copyright 
infringement, as provided under its law in accordance with 
this Article;115  
 
(iii) 
order court costs, fees or expenses as provided for under 
paragraph 10; and 
 
(iv) 
order the destruction of devices and products found to be 
involved in the prohibited activity; and 
 
(b) 
a Party may provide that damages shall not be available against a 
non-profit library, archive, educational institution, museum or 
public non-commercial broadcasting entity, if it sustains the burden 
of proving that it was not aware or had no reason to believe that its 
acts constituted a prohibited activity. 
 
 
Article 18.75:  Provisional Measures 
 
1. 
Each Party’s authorities shall act on a request for relief in respect of an 
intellectual property right inaudita altera parte expeditiously in accordance with 
that Party’s judicial rules. 
 
2.  
Each Party shall provide that its judicial authorities have the authority to 
require the applicant for a provisional measure in respect of an intellectual 
property right to provide any reasonably available evidence in order to satisfy the 
judicial authority, with a sufficient degree of certainty, that the applicant’s right is 
being infringed or that the infringement is imminent, and to order the applicant to 
                                            
114  For greater certainty, a Party may, but is not required to, put in place separate remedies in 
respect of Article 18.68 (TPMs) and Article 18.69 (RMI), if those remedies are available under its 
copyright law. 
 
115  If a Party’s copyright law provides for both pre-established damages and additional damages, 
that Party may comply with the requirements of this subparagraph by providing for only one of 
these forms of damages. 
18-48 
provide security or equivalent assurance set at a level sufficient to protect the 
defendant and to prevent abuse.  Such security or equivalent assurance shall not 
unreasonably deter recourse to those procedures. 
 
3. 
In civil judicial proceedings concerning copyright or related rights 
infringement and trademark counterfeiting, each Party shall provide that its 
judicial authorities have the authority to order the seizure or other taking into 
custody of suspected infringing goods, materials and implements relevant to the 
infringement, and, at least for trademark counterfeiting, documentary evidence 
relevant to the infringement.  
 
 
Article 18.76:  Special Requirements related to Border Measures 
 
1. 
Each Party shall provide for applications to suspend the release of, or to 
detain, any suspected counterfeit or confusingly similar trademark or pirated 
copyright goods that are imported into the territory of the Party.116 
 
2. 
Each Party shall provide that any right holder initiating procedures for its 
competent authorities117 to suspend release of suspected counterfeit or confusingly 
similar trademark or pirated copyright goods into free circulation is required to 
provide adequate evidence to satisfy the competent authorities that, under the law 
of the Party providing the procedures, there is prima facie an infringement of the 
right holder's intellectual property right and to supply sufficient information that 
may reasonably be expected to be within the right holder’s knowledge to make the 
suspect goods reasonably recognisable by its competent authorities.  The 
requirement to provide that information shall not unreasonably deter recourse to 
these procedures. 
 
3. 
Each Party shall provide that its competent authorities have the authority 
to require a right holder initiating procedures to suspend the release of suspected 
counterfeit or confusingly similar trademark or pirated copyright goods, to 
provide a reasonable security or equivalent assurance sufficient to protect the 
                                            
116  For the purposes of this Article: 
 
(a) counterfeit trademark goods means any goods, including packaging, bearing without 
authorisation a trademark that is identical to the trademark validly registered in respect of 
such goods, or that cannot be distinguished in its essential aspects from such a trademark, 
and that thereby infringes the rights of the owner of the trademark in question under the 
law of the Party providing the procedures under this Section; and 
 
(b) pirated copyright goods means any goods that are copies made without the consent of the 
right holder or person duly authorised by the right holder in the country of production and 
that are made directly or indirectly from an article where the making of that copy would 
have constituted an infringement of a copyright or a related right under the law of the 
Party providing the procedures under this Section. 
 
117  For the purposes of this Article, unless otherwise specified, competent authorities may include 
the appropriate judicial, administrative or law enforcement authorities under a Party’s law. 
18-49 
defendant and the competent authorities and to prevent abuse.  Each Party shall 
provide that such security or equivalent assurance does not unreasonably deter 
recourse to these procedures.  A Party may provide that the security may be in the 
form of a bond conditioned to hold the defendant harmless from any loss or 
damage resulting from any suspension of the release of goods in the event the 
competent authorities determine that the article is not an infringing good. 
 
4. 
Without prejudice to a Party’s law pertaining to privacy or the 
confidentiality of information: 
 
(a) 
if a Party’s competent authorities have detained or suspended the 
release of goods that are suspected of being counterfeit trademark or 
pirated copyright goods, that Party may provide that its competent 
authorities have the authority to inform the right holder without 
undue delay of the names and addresses of the consignor, exporter, 
consignee or importer; a description of the goods; the quantity of 
the goods; and, if known, the country of origin of the goods;118 or 
 
(b) 
if a Party does not provide its competent authority with the authority 
referred to in subparagraph (a) when suspect goods are detained or 
suspended from release, it shall provide, at least in cases of 
imported goods, its competent authorities with the authority to 
provide the information specified in subparagraph (a) to the right 
holder normally within 30 working days of the seizure or 
determination that the goods are counterfeit trademark goods or 
pirated copyright goods. 
 
5. 
Each Party shall provide that its competent authorities may initiate border 
measures ex officio119 with respect to goods under customs control120 that are: 
 
(a) 
imported;  
 
(b) 
destined for export;121 or 
 
(c) 
in transit,122, 123  
                                            
118  For greater certainty, a Party may establish reasonable procedures to receive or access that 
information. 
 
119  For greater certainty, that ex officio action does not require a formal complaint from a third 
party or right holder. 
 
120  For the purposes of this Article, a Party may treat “goods under customs control” as meaning 
goods that are subject to a Party’s customs procedures. 
 
121  For the purposes of this Article, a Party may treat goods “destined for export” as meaning 
exported. 
 
122  This subparagraph applies to suspect goods that are in transit from one customs office to 
another customs office in the Party’s territory from which the goods will be exported. 
18-50 
 
and that are suspected of being counterfeit trademark goods or pirated 
copyright goods. 
 
6. 
Each Party shall adopt or maintain a procedure by which its competent 
authorities may determine within a reasonable period of time after the initiation of 
the procedures described in paragraph 1, paragraph 5(a), paragraph 5(b) and, if 
applicable, paragraph 5(c), whether the suspect goods infringe an intellectual 
property right. 124   If a Party provides administrative procedures for the 
determination of an infringement, it may also provide its authorities with the 
authority to impose administrative penalties or sanctions, which may include fines 
or the seizure of the infringing goods following a determination that the goods are 
infringing. 
 
7. 
Each Party shall provide that its competent authorities have the authority 
to order the destruction of goods following a determination that the goods are 
infringing. In cases in which the goods are not destroyed, each Party shall ensure 
that, except in exceptional circumstances, the goods are disposed of outside the 
channels of commerce in such a manner as to avoid any harm to the right holder.  
In regard to counterfeit trademark goods, the simple removal of the trademark 
unlawfully affixed shall not be sufficient, other than in exceptional cases, to 
permit the release of the goods into the channels of commerce. 
 
8. 
If a Party establishes or assesses, in connection with the procedures 
described in this Article, an application fee, storage fee or destruction fee, that fee 
shall not be set at an amount that unreasonably deters recourse to these 
procedures. 
 
9. 
This Article also shall apply to goods of a commercial nature sent in small 
consignments.  A Party may exclude from the application of this Article small 
quantities of goods of a non-commercial nature contained in travellers’ personal 
luggage.125 
 
 
                                                                                                                        
 
123  As an alternative to this subparagraph, a Party shall instead endeavour to provide, if 
appropriate and with a view to eliminating international trade in counterfeit trademark goods or 
pirated copyright goods, available information to another Party in respect of goods that it has 
examined without a local consignee and that are transhipped through its territory and destined for 
the territory of the other Party, to inform that other Party’s efforts to identify suspect goods upon 
arrival in its territory. 
 
124  A Party may comply with the obligation in this Article with respect to a determination that 
suspect goods under paragraph 5 infringe an intellectual property right through a determination 
that the suspect goods bear a false trade description. 
 
125  For greater certainty, a Party may also exclude from the application of this Article small 
quantities of goods of a non-commercial nature sent in small consignments. 
18-51 
Article 18.77:  Criminal Procedures and Penalties 
 
1. 
Each Party shall provide for criminal procedures and penalties to be 
applied at least in cases of wilful trademark counterfeiting or copyright or related 
rights piracy on a commercial scale.  In respect of wilful copyright or related 
rights piracy, “on a commercial scale” includes at least: 
 
(a) 
acts carried out for commercial advantage or financial gain; and 
 
(b)  
significant acts, not carried out for commercial advantage or 
financial gain, that have a substantial prejudicial impact on the 
interests of the copyright or related rights holder in relation to the 
marketplace.126, 127 
 
2. 
Each Party shall treat wilful importation or exportation of counterfeit 
trademark goods or pirated copyright goods on a commercial scale as unlawful 
activities subject to criminal penalties.128 
 
3. 
Each Party shall provide for criminal procedures and penalties to be 
applied in cases of wilful importation129 and domestic use, in the course of trade 
and on a commercial scale, of a label or packaging:130 
 
(a) 
to which a trademark has been applied without authorisation that is 
identical to, or cannot be distinguished from, a trademark registered 
in its territory; and 
 
(b) 
that is intended to be used in the course of trade on goods or in 
relation to services that are identical to goods or services for which 
that trademark is registered. 
 
  
                                            
126  The Parties understand that a Party may comply with subparagraph (b) by addressing such 
significant acts under its criminal procedures and penalties for non-authorised uses of protected 
works, performances and phonograms in its law. 
 
127  A Party may provide that the volume and value of any infringing items may be taken into 
account in determining whether the act has a substantial prejudicial impact on the interests of the 
copyright or related rights holder in relation to the marketplace. 
 
128  The Parties understand that a Party may comply with its obligation under this paragraph by 
providing that distribution or sale of counterfeit trademark goods or pirated copyright goods on a 
commercial scale is an unlawful activity subject to criminal penalties.  Furthermore, criminal 
procedures and penalties as specified in paragraphs 1, 2 and 3 are applicable in any free trade 
zones in a Party. 
 
129  A Party may comply with its obligation relating to importation of labels or packaging through 
its measures concerning distribution. 
 
130  A Party may comply with its obligations under this paragraph by providing for criminal 
procedures and penalties to be applied to attempts to commit a trademark offence. 
18-52 
4. 
Recognising the need to address the unauthorised copying 131  of a 
cinematographic work from a performance in a movie theatre that causes 
significant harm to a right holder in the market for that work, and recognising the 
need to deter such harm, each Party shall adopt or maintain measures, which shall 
at a minimum include, but need not be limited to, appropriate criminal procedures 
and penalties. 
 
5. 
With respect to the offences for which this Article requires a Party to 
provide for criminal procedures and penalties, each Party shall ensure that 
criminal liability for aiding and abetting is available under its law. 
 
6. 
With respect to the offences described in paragraphs 1 through 5, each 
Party shall provide the following: 
 
(a) 
Penalties that include sentences of imprisonment as well as 
monetary fines sufficiently high to provide a deterrent to future acts 
of infringement, consistent with the level of penalties applied for 
crimes of a corresponding gravity.132 
 
(b) 
Its judicial authorities have the authority, in determining penalties, 
to account for the seriousness of the circumstances, which may 
include circumstances that involve threats to, or effects on, health 
or safety.133 
 
(c) 
Its judicial or other competent authorities have the authority to 
order the seizure of suspected counterfeit trademark goods or 
pirated copyright goods, any related materials and implements used 
in the commission of the alleged offence, documentary evidence 
relevant to the alleged offence and assets derived from, or obtained 
through the alleged infringing activity.  If a Party requires 
identification of items subject to seizure as a prerequisite for 
issuing a judicial order referred to in this subparagraph, that Party 
shall not require the items to be described in greater detail than 
necessary to identify them for the purpose of seizure. 
 
(d) 
Its judicial authorities have the authority to order the forfeiture, at 
least for serious offences, of any assets derived from or obtained 
through the infringing activity. 
 
(e) 
Its judicial authorities have the authority to order the forfeiture or 
destruction of: 
                                            
131  For the purposes of this Article, a Party may treat the term “copying” as synonymous with 
reproduction. 
 
132  The Parties understand that there is no obligation for a Party to provide for the possibility of 
imprisonment and monetary fines to be imposed in parallel. 
 
133  A Party may also account for such circumstances through a separate criminal offence. 
18-53 
 
(i) 
all counterfeit trademark goods or pirated copyright goods; 
 
(ii) 
materials and implements that have been predominantly 
used in the creation of pirated copyright goods or 
counterfeit trademark goods; and 
 
(iii) 
any other labels or packaging to which a counterfeit 
trademark has been applied and that have been used in the 
commission of the offence. 
 
In cases in which counterfeit trademark goods and pirated copyright goods 
are not destroyed, the judicial or other competent authorities shall ensure 
that, except in exceptional circumstances, those goods are disposed of 
outside the channels of commerce in such a manner as to avoid causing 
any harm to the right holder.  Each Party shall further provide that 
forfeiture or destruction under this subparagraph and subparagraph (c) 
shall occur without compensation of any kind to the defendant. 
 
(f) 
Its judicial or other competent authorities have the authority to 
release or, in the alternative, provide access to, goods, material, 
implements, and other evidence held by the relevant authority to a 
right holder for civil134 infringement proceedings. 
 
(g) 
Its competent authorities may act upon their own initiative to 
initiate legal action without the need for a formal complaint by a 
third person or right holder.135 
 
7. 
With respect to the offences described in paragraphs 1 through 5, a Party 
may provide that its judicial authorities have the authority to order the seizure or 
forfeiture of assets, or alternatively, a fine, the value of which corresponds to the 
assets derived from, or obtained directly or indirectly through, the infringing 
activity. 
 
 
Article 18.78:  Trade Secrets136  
 
1. 
In the course of ensuring effective protection against unfair competition as 
provided in Article 10bis of the Paris Convention, each Party shall ensure that 
                                            
134  A Party may also provide this authority in connection with administrative infringement 
proceedings. 
 
135  With regard to copyright and related rights piracy provided for under paragraph 1, a Party may 
limit application of this subparagraph to the cases in which there is an impact on the right holder’s 
ability to exploit the work, performance or phonogram in the market. 
 
136  For greater certainty, this Article is without prejudice to a Party’s measures protecting good 
faith lawful disclosures to provide evidence of a violation of that Party’s law. 
18-54 
persons have the legal means to prevent trade secrets lawfully in their control 
from being disclosed to, acquired by, or used by others (including state-owned 
enterprises) without their consent in a manner contrary to honest commercial 
practices.137  As used in this Chapter, trade secrets encompass, at a minimum, 
undisclosed information as provided for in Article 39.2 of the TRIPS Agreement. 
 
2. 
Subject to paragraph 3, each Party shall provide for criminal procedures 
and penalties for one or more of the following: 
 
(a) 
the unauthorised and wilful access to a trade secret held in a 
computer system; 
 
(b) 
the unauthorised and wilful misappropriation138 of a trade secret, 
including by means of a computer system; or 
 
(c) 
the fraudulent disclosure, or alternatively, the unauthorised and 
wilful disclosure, of a trade secret, including by means of a 
computer system. 
 
3. 
With respect to the relevant acts referred to in paragraph 2, a Party may, as 
appropriate, limit the availability of its criminal procedures, or limit the level of 
penalties available, to one or more of the following cases in which: 
 
(a) 
the acts are for the purposes of commercial advantage or financial 
gain; 
 
(b) 
the acts are related to a product or service in national or 
international commerce; 
 
(c) 
the acts are intended to injure the owner of such trade secret;  
 
(d) 
the acts are directed by or for the benefit of or in association with a 
foreign economic entity; or 
 
(e) 
the acts are detrimental to a Party’s economic interests, 
international relations, or national defence or national security. 
 
 
                                            
137  For the purposes of this paragraph “a manner contrary to honest commercial practices” means 
at least practices such as breach of contract, breach of confidence and inducement to breach, and 
includes the acquisition of undisclosed information by third parties that knew, or were grossly 
negligent in failing to know, that those practices were involved in the acquisition. 
 
138  A Party may deem the term “misappropriation” to be synonymous with “unlawful acquisition”. 
18-55 
Article 18.79:  Protection of Encrypted Program-Carrying Satellite and 
Cable Signals 
 
1. 
Each Party shall make it a criminal offence to: 
 
(a) 
manufacture, assemble, modify, 139 import, export, sell, lease or 
otherwise distribute a tangible or intangible device or system 
knowing or having reason to know140 that the device or system 
meets at least one of the following conditions: 
 
(i) 
it is intended to be used to assist; 
 
(ii) 
it is primarily of assistance; or 
 
 
(iii) 
its principal function is solely to assist, 
 
in decoding an encrypted program-carrying satellite signal without the 
authorisation of the lawful distributor141 of such signal;142 and 
 
(b) 
with respect to an encrypted program-carrying satellite signal, 
wilfully: 
 
(i) 
receive143 such a signal; or 
(ii) 
further distribute144 such signal, 
 
knowing that it has been decoded without the authorisation of the lawful 
distributor of the signal. 
 
                                            
139  For greater certainty, a Party may treat “assemble” and “modify” as incorporated in 
“manufacture”. 
 
140  For the purposes of this paragraph, a Party may provide that “having reason to know” may be 
demonstrated through reasonable evidence, taking into account the facts and circumstances 
surrounding the alleged illegal act, as part of the Party’s “knowledge” requirements.  A Party may 
treat “having reason to know” as meaning “wilful negligence”. 
 
141  With regard to the criminal offences and penalties in paragraph 1 and paragraph 3, a Party may 
require a demonstration of intent to avoid payment to the lawful distributor, or a demonstration of 
intent to otherwise secure a pecuniary benefit to which the recipient is not entitled. 
 
142  The obligation regarding export may be met by making it a criminal offence to possess and 
distribute a device or system described in this paragraph.  For the purposes of this Article, a Party 
may provide that a “lawful distributor” means a person that has the lawful right in that Party’s 
territory to distribute the encrypted program-carrying signal and authorise its decoding. 
 
143  For greater certainty and for the purposes of paragraph 1(b) and paragraph 3(b), a Party may 
provide that wilful receipt of an encrypted program-carrying satellite or cable signal means receipt 
and use of the signal, or means receipt and decoding of the signal. 
 
144  For greater certainty, a Party may interpret “further distribute” as “retransmit to the public”. 
18-56 
2. 
Each Party shall provide for civil remedies for a person that holds an 
interest in an encrypted program-carrying satellite signal or its content and that is 
injured by an activity described in paragraph 1. 
 
3. 
Each Party shall provide for criminal penalties or civil remedies145 for 
wilfully: 
  
(a) 
manufacturing or distributing equipment knowing that the 
equipment is intended to be used in the unauthorised reception of 
any encrypted  program-carrying cable signal; and 
 
(b) 
receiving, or assisting another to receive,146 an encrypted program-
carrying cable signal without authorisation of the lawful distributor 
of the signal. 
 
 
Article 18.80:  Government Use of Software 
 
1. 
Each Party recognises the importance of promoting the adoption of 
measures to enhance government awareness of respect for intellectual property 
rights and of the detrimental effects of the infringement of intellectual property 
rights. 
 
2. 
Each Party shall adopt or maintain appropriate laws, regulations, policies, 
orders, government-issued guidelines, or administrative or executive decrees that 
provide that its central government agencies use only non-infringing computer 
software protected by copyright and related rights, and, if applicable, only use that 
computer software in a manner authorised by the relevant licence.  These 
measures shall apply to the acquisition and management of the software for 
government use.147 
 
 
                                            
145  If a Party provides for civil remedies, it may require a demonstration of injury. 
 
146  A Party may comply with its obligation in respect of “assisting another to receive” by 
providing for criminal penalties to be available against a person wilfully publishing any 
information in order to enable or assist another person to receive a signal without authorisation of 
the lawful distributor of the signal. 
 
147  For greater certainty, paragraph 2 should not be interpreted as encouraging regional 
government agencies to use infringing computer software or, if applicable, to use computer 
software in a manner which is not authorised by the relevant licence. 
 
18-57 
Section J: Internet Service Providers148 
 
 
Article 18.81:  Definitions  
 
For the purposes of this Section: 
 
the term copyright includes related rights; and 
 
Internet Service Provider means: 
 
(a) 
a provider of online services for the transmission, routing, or 
providing of connections for digital online communications, 
between or among points specified by a user, of material of the 
user’s choosing, undertaking the function in Article 18.82.2(a) 
(Legal Remedies and Safe Harbours); or 
 
(b) 
a provider of online services undertaking the functions in Article 
18.82.2(c) or Article 18.82.2(d) (Legal Remedies and Safe 
Harbours).  
 
For greater certainty, Internet Service Provider includes a provider of the services 
listed above that engages in caching carried out through an automated process. 
 
 
Article 18.82:  Legal Remedies and Safe Harbours149 
 
1. 
The Parties recognise the importance of facilitating the continued 
development of legitimate online services operating as intermediaries and, in a 
manner consistent with Article 41 of the TRIPS Agreement, providing 
enforcement procedures that permit effective action by right holders against 
copyright infringement covered under this Chapter that occurs in the online 
environment.  Accordingly, each Party shall ensure that legal remedies are 
available for right holders to address such copyright infringement and shall 
establish or maintain appropriate safe harbours in respect of online services that 
are Internet Service Providers.  This framework of legal remedies and safe 
harbours shall include: 
 
(a) 
legal incentives150 for Internet Service Providers to cooperate with 
copyright owners to deter the unauthorised storage and 
transmission of copyrighted materials or, in the alternative, to take 
                                            
148  Annex 18-F applies to this Section. 
 
149  Annex 18-E applies to Article 18.82.3 and Article 18.82.4 (Legal Remedies and Safe 
Harbours). 
 
150  For greater certainty, the Parties understand that implementation of the obligations in 
paragraph 1(a) on “legal incentives” may take different forms. 
18-58 
other action to deter the unauthorised storage and transmission of 
copyrighted materials; and 
 
(b) 
limitations in its law that have the effect of precluding monetary 
relief 
against 
Internet 
Service 
Providers 
for 
copyright 
infringements that they do not control, initiate or direct, and that 
take place through systems or networks controlled or operated by 
them or on their behalf.151  
 
2. 
The limitations described in paragraph 1(b) shall include limitations in 
respect of the following functions: 
 
(a) 
transmitting, routing or providing connections for material 
without modification of its content152 or the intermediate and 
transient storage of that material done automatically in the 
course of such a technical process; 
 
(b) 
caching carried out through an automated process; 
 
(c) 
storage153, at the direction of a user, of material residing on a 
system or network controlled or operated by or for the Internet 
Service Provider;154 and 
 
(d)  
referring or linking users to an online location by using 
information location tools, including hyperlinks and directories. 
 
3. 
To facilitate effective action to address infringement, each Party shall 
prescribe in its law conditions for Internet Service Providers to qualify for the 
limitations described in paragraph 1(b), or, alternatively, shall provide for 
circumstances under which Internet Service Providers do not qualify for the 
limitations described in paragraph 1(b):155, 156 
                                            
151  The Parties understand that, to the extent that a Party determines, consistent with its 
international legal obligations, that a particular act does not constitute copyright infringement, 
there is no obligation to provide for a limitation in relation to that act. 
 
152  The Parties understand that such modification does not include a modification made as part of 
a technical process or for solely technical reasons such as division into packets. 
 
153  For greater certainty, a Party may interpret “storage” as “hosting”. 
 
154  For greater certainty, the storage of material may include e-mails and their attachments stored 
in the Internet Service Provider’s server and web pages residing on the Internet Service Provider’s 
server. 
  
155  A Party may comply with the obligations in paragraph 3 by maintaining a framework in which: 
 
(a) there is a stakeholder organisation that includes representatives of both Internet Service 
Providers and right holders, established with government involvement;  
 
18-59 
 
(a) 
With respect to the functions referred to in paragraph 2(c) and 
paragraph 2(d), these conditions shall include a requirement for 
Internet Service Providers to expeditiously remove or disable 
access to material residing on their networks or systems upon 
obtaining actual knowledge of the copyright infringement or 
becoming aware of facts or circumstances from which the 
infringement is apparent, such as through receiving a notice157 of 
alleged infringement from the right holder or a person authorised to 
act on its behalf, 
 
(b) 
An Internet Service Provider that removes or disables access to 
material in good faith under subparagraph (a) shall be exempt from 
any liability for having done so, provided that it takes reasonable 
steps in advance or promptly after to notify the person whose 
material is removed or disabled.158 
                                                                                                                        
(b) that stakeholder organisation develops and maintains effective, efficient and timely 
procedures for entities certified by the stakeholder organisation to verify, without undue 
delay, the validity of each notice of alleged copyright infringement by confirming that the 
notice is not the result of mistake or misidentification, before forwarding the verified 
notice to the relevant Internet Service Provider; 
 
(c) there are appropriate guidelines for Internet Service Providers to follow in order to qualify 
for the limitation described in paragraph 1(b), including requiring that the Internet Service 
Provider promptly removes or disables access to the identified materials upon receipt of a 
verified notice; and be exempted from liability for having done so in good faith in 
accordance with those guidelines; and 
 
(d)  there are appropriate measures that provide for liability in cases in which an Internet 
Service Provider has actual knowledge of the infringement or awareness of facts or 
circumstances from which the infringement is apparent. 
 
156  The Parties understand that a Party that has yet to implement the obligations in paragraphs 3 
and 4 will do so in a manner that is both effective and consistent with that Party’s existing 
constitutional provisions.  To that end, a Party may establish an appropriate role for the 
government that does not impair the timeliness of the process provided in paragraphs 3 and 4, and 
does not entail advance government review of each individual notice. 
 
157  For greater certainty, a notice of alleged infringement, as may be set out under a Party’s law, 
must contain information that: 
 
(a) 
is reasonably sufficient to enable the Internet Service Provider to identify the work, 
performance or phonogram claimed to be infringed, the alleged infringing material, and 
the online location of the alleged infringement; and 
 
(b) 
has a sufficient indicia of reliability with respect to the authority of the person sending 
the notice. 
  
158  With respect to the function in subparagraph 2(b), a Party may limit the requirements of 
paragraph 3 related to an Internet Service Provider removing or disabling access to material to 
circumstances in which the Internet Service Provider becomes aware or receives notification that 
the cached material has been removed or access to it has been disabled at the originating site. 
18-60 
4. 
If a system for counter-notices is provided under a Party’s law, and if 
material has been removed or access has been disabled in accordance with 
paragraph 3, that Party shall require that the Internet Service Provider restores the 
material subject to a counter-notice, unless the person giving the original notice 
seeks judicial relief within a reasonable period of time. 
 
5. 
Each Party shall ensure that monetary remedies are available in its legal 
system against any person that makes a knowing material misrepresentation in a 
notice or counter-notice that causes injury to any interested party159 as a result of 
an Internet Service Provider relying on the misrepresentation. 
 
6. 
Eligibility for the limitations in paragraph 1 shall not be conditioned on the 
Internet Service Provider monitoring its service or affirmatively seeking facts 
indicating infringing activity.  
 
7.  
Each Party shall provide procedures, whether judicial or administrative, in 
accordance with that Party’s legal system, and consistent with principles of due 
process and privacy, that enable a copyright owner that has made a legally 
sufficient claim of copyright infringement to obtain expeditiously from an Internet 
 
Service Provider information in the provider’s possession identifying the 
alleged infringer, in cases in which that information is sought for the purpose of 
protecting or enforcing that copyright. 
 
8.  
The Parties understand that the failure of an Internet Service Provider to 
qualify for the limitations in paragraph 1(b) does not itself result in liability.  
Further, this Article is without prejudice to the availability of other limitations and 
exceptions to copyright, or any other defences under a Party’s legal system. 
 
9. 
The Parties recognise the importance, in implementing their obligations 
under this Article, of taking into account the impacts on right holders and Internet 
Service Providers.  
 
 
Section K: Final Provisions 
 
 
Article 18.83:  Final Provisions 
 
1. 
Except as otherwise provided in Article 18.10 (Application of Chapter to 
Existing Subject Matter and Prior Acts) and paragraphs 2, 3 and 4, each Party 
                                            
159  For greater certainty, the Parties understand that, “any interested party” may be limited to those 
with a legal interest recognised under that Party’s law. 
 
18-61 
shall give effect to the provisions of this Chapter on the date of entry into force of 
this Agreement for that Party.160

18-67 
(A) 
The Parties will consider a justified request from Viet Nam 
for an extension of the transition period for up to two 
additional years. Viet Nam’s request shall include the reason 
for the requested extension.  Viet Nam may avail itself of 
this one-time extension upon providing a request in 
accordance with this paragraph unless the Commission 
decides otherwise within 60 days of receiving the request.  
No later than the date on which the additional two-year 
period expires, Viet Nam shall provide to the Commission 
in writing a report on the measures it has taken to fulfil its 
obligation under Article 18.50 (Protection of Undisclosed 
Test or Other Data) and Article 18.51 (Biologics).    
 
(B) 
Viet Nam may make a further request for an additional one-
time extension pursuant to Chapter 27 (Administrative and

the reason for the request.  The Commission shall decide 
pursuant to the procedures set forth in Article 27.3 
(Decision-Making), whether to grant the request based on 
relevant factors, which may include capacity as well as 
other appropriate circumstances.  Viet Nam shall make the 
request no later than one year prior to the expiration of the 
two-year transition period referred to in the first sentence of 
paragraph (A).  The Parties shall give due consideration to 
that request.  If the Committee grants Viet Nam’s request,

report on the measures it has taken to fulfil its obligations 
under Article 18.50 (Protection of Undisclosed Test or 
Other Data) and Article 18.51 (Biologics) no later than the 
date on which the extension period expires.

Viet Nam’s implementation of Article 18.50 (Protection of 
Undisclosed Test or Other Data) and Article 18.51 
(Biologics) during three years after the conclusion of the 
extension period referred to in paragraph (A) shall not be 
subject to dispute settlement under Chapter 28 (Dispute 
Settlement).

under Article 18.50 (Protection of Undisclosed Test or Other Data) 
and Article 18.51 (Biologics) in connection with subparagraphs 
(f)(x) and (f)(xi), Viet Nam may consider adopting measures to 
incentivise the timely initiation of the filing of these applications 
with a view to the introduction of new pharmaceutical products in 
its market.  To that end, Viet Nam shall notify the other Parties

Notwithstanding the obligations in Article 18.7.2 (International 
Agreements), and subject to paragraphs 2, 3 and 4 of this Annex, New Zealand 
shall: 
  
(a) 
accede to UPOV 1991 within three years of the date of entry into 
force of this Agreement for New Zealand; or 
  
(b) 
adopt a sui generis plant variety rights system that gives effect to 
UPOV 1991 within three years of the date of entry into force of this 
Agreement for New Zealand. 
  
2. 
Nothing in paragraph 1 shall preclude the adoption by New Zealand of 
measures it deems necessary to protect indigenous plant species in fulfilment of 
its obligations under the Treaty of Waitangi, provided that such measures are not 
used as a means of arbitrary or unjustified discrimination against a person of 
another Party. 
  
3. 
The consistency of any measures referred to in paragraph 2 with the 
obligations in paragraph 1 shall not be subject to the dispute settlement provisions 
of this Agreement. 
  
4. 
The interpretation of the Treaty of Waitangi, including as to the nature of 
the rights and obligations arising under it, shall not be subject to the dispute 
settlement provisions of this Agreement.  Chapter 28 (Dispute Settlement) shall 
otherwise apply to this Annex.  A panel established under Article 28.7 
(Establishment of a Panel) may be requested to determine only whether any 
measure referred to in paragraph 2 is inconsistent with a Party’s rights under this 
Agreement.

Annex 18-B 
 
Chile 
 
 
1. 
Nothing in Article 18.50.1 or Article 18.50.2 (Protection of Undisclosed 
Test or Other Data) or Article 18.51 (Biologics) prevents Chile from maintaining 
or applying the provisions of Article 91 of Chile’s Law No. 19.039 on Industrial 
Property, as in effect on the date of agreement in principle of this Agreement.   
 
2. 
Notwithstanding Article 1.2 (Relation to Other Agreements), paragraph 1 
is without prejudice to any Party’s rights and obligations under an international 
agreement in effect prior to the date of entry into force of this Agreement for 
Chile, including any rights and obligations under a trade agreement between Chile 
and another Party.

Annex 18-C 
 
Malaysia 
 
 
1. 
Malaysia may, for the purpose of granting protection as specified in Article 
18.50.1 and Article 18.50.2 (Protection of Undisclosed Test or Other Data) and 
Article 18.51.1 (Biologics), require an applicant to commence the process of 
obtaining marketing approval for pharmaceutical products covered under those 
Articles within 18 months from the date that the product is first granted marketing 
approval in any country.   
 
2. 
For greater certainty, the periods of protection referred to in Article 
18.50.1 and Article 18.50.2 (Protection of Undisclosed Test or Other Data) and 
Article 18.51.1 (Biologics) shall begin on the date of marketing approval of the 
pharmaceutical product in Malaysia.

Annex 18-D 
 
Peru 
 
 
Part 1:  Applicable to Article 18.46 (Patent Term Adjustment for 
Unreasonable Granting Authority Delays) and Article 18.48 (Patent Term 
Adjustment for Unreasonable Curtailment) 
 
 
To the extent that Andean Decision 486, Common Industrial Property 
Regime, and Andean Decision 689, Adequacy of Certain Articles of Decision 486, 
restricts Peru’s implementation of its obligations set forth in Article 18.46.3 
(Patent Term Adjustment for Unreasonable Granting Authority Delays) and 
Article 18.48.2 (Patent Term Adjustment for Unreasonable Curtailment), Peru 
commits to make its best efforts to obtain a waiver from the Andean Community 
that allows it to adjust its patent term in a way that is consistent with Article 
18.46.3 (Patent Term Adjustment for Unreasonable Granting Authority Delays) 
and Article 18.48.2 (Patent Term Adjustment for Unreasonable Curtailment).  
Further, if Peru demonstrates that the Andean Community withheld its request for 
a waiver despite its best efforts, Peru will continue ensuring that it does not 
discriminate with respect to the availability or enjoyment of patent rights based on 
the field of technology, the place of invention, and whether products are imported 
or locally produced.  Thus, Peru confirms that the treatment of pharmaceutical 
patents will be no less favourable than treatment of other patents in respect of the 
processing and examination of patent applications. 
 
Part 2:  Applicable to Article 18.50 (Protection of Undisclosed Test or Other 
Data) and Article 18.51 (Biologics) 
 
1. 
If Peru relies, pursuant to Article 18.50.1(b) (Protection of Undisclosed Test 
or Other Data), on a marketing approval granted by another Party, and grants 
approval within six months of the date of the filing of a complete application for 
marketing approval filed in Peru, Peru may provide that the protection specified in 
Article 18.50.1(b) (Protection of Undisclosed Test or Other Data) and Article 18.51 
(Biologics), as applicable, shall begin with the date of the first marketing approval 
relied on.  In implementing Article 18.50.1(b) (Protection of Undisclosed Test or 
Other Data) and Article 18.51.1(b)(i) (Biologics), Peru may apply the period of 
protection established in Article 16.10.2(b) of the United States – Peru Trade 
Promotion Agreement, done at Washington, District of Columbia, April 12, 2006. 
 
2. 
Peru may apply paragraph 1 to Article 18.50.2 (Protection of Undisclosed 
Test or Other Data).

prescribe in its law circumstances under which Internet Service 
Providers do not qualify for the limitations described in Article 
18.82.1(b) (Legal Remedies and Safe Harbours); 
 
(b) 
provide statutory secondary liability for copyright infringement in 
cases in which a person, by means of the Internet or another digital 
network, provides a service primarily for the purpose of enabling 
acts of copyright infringement, in relation to factors set out in its law, 
such as:  
 
(i) 
whether the person marketed or promoted the service as one 
that could be used to enable acts of copyright infringement; 
 
(ii) 
whether the person had knowledge that the service was used to 
enable a significant number of acts of copyright infringement; 
 
(iii) whether the service has significant uses other than to enable 
acts of copyright infringement;  
 
(iv) the person’s ability, as part of providing the service, to limit 
acts of copyright infringement, and any action taken by the 
person to do so;  
 
(v) 
any benefits the person received as a result of enabling the acts 
of copyright infringement; and 
 
(vi) the economic viability of the service if it were not used to 
enable acts of copyright infringement; 
 
(c) 
require Internet Service Providers carrying out the functions referred 
to in Article 18.82.2(a) and (c) (Legal Remedies and Safe Harbours) 
to participate in a system for forwarding notices of alleged 
infringement, including if material is made available online, and if 
18-74 
the Internet Service Provider fails to do so, subjecting that provider  
to pre-established monetary damages for that failure; 
 
(d) 
induce Internet Service Providers offering information location tools 
to remove within a specified period of time any reproductions of 
material that they make, and communicate to the public, as part of 
offering the information location tool upon receiving a notice of 
alleged infringement and after the original material has been 
removed from the electronic location set out in the notice; and 
 
(e) 
induce Internet Service Providers carrying out the function referred 
to in Article 18.82.2(c) (Legal Remedies and Safe Harbours) to 
remove or disable access to material upon becoming aware of a 
decision of a court of that Party to the effect that the person storing 
the material infringes copyright in the material. 
 
2. 
For a Party to which Article 18.82.3 and Article 18.82.4 (Legal Remedies 
and Safe Harbours) do not apply pursuant to paragraph 1 of this Annex, and in 
light of, among other things, paragraph 1(b) of this Annex, for the purposes of 
Article 18.82.1(a), legal incentives shall not mean the conditions for Internet 
Service Providers to qualify for the limitations provided for in Article 18.82.1(b), 
as set out in Article 18.82.3.

Agreement, done at Miami, June 6, 2003, which is incorporated into and made 
part of this Annex.
