11  For greater certainty, this does not preclude a Bruneian enterprise from holding a majority share in a joint 
venture or other similar arrangement as a result of commercial negotiations between such an investor of another 
Party, or its investment, and that Bruneian enterprise. 
ANNEX II – BRUNEI DARUSSALAM – 13
