APPENDIX C 
 
 TARIFF DIFFERENTIALS OF MEXICO 
 
 
1. 
For an originating good identified in Table C-1, if Mexico applies different 
preferential tariff treatment to other Parties for that originating good in accordance 
with the Tariff Schedule of Mexico to Annex 2-D (Tariff Commitments), Mexico 
shall apply the rate of customs duty for the originating good of the Party: 
 
(a) 
where the good is wholly obtained, either in that Party or in that 
Party and Mexico;  
 
(b) 
where the good is produced entirely, exclusively from originating 
materials, excluding any materials produced in another Party other 
than Mexico;  
 
(c) 
where the good is produced entirely, from originating materials, 
excluding any materials produced in another Party other than 
Mexico, and from non-originating materials that have met the 
relevant product specific rule in Annex 3-D (Product-Specific 
Rules of Origin); or 
 
(d) 
where the good is produced from originating materials produced in 
Parties other than that Party or Mexico, provided that each of those 
materials satisfies the applicable change in tariff classification 
requirement set out in Table C-1. 
 
2. 
If the originating good is produced in a Party from originating materials 
produced in Parties other than that Party or Mexico and any of those 
materials do not satisfy the applicable change in tariff classification 
requirement in Table C-1, an importer may: 
 
(a) 
claim the highest rate of customs duty for the originating good 
among the Parties where those originating materials were 
produced; or 
 
(b) 
in accordance with paragraph 10 of Section B of Annex 2-D (Tariff 
Commitments), claim the highest rate of customs duty applicable 
to all Parties for the originating good.
