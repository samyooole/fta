regulators in Malaysia.  Shariah requirements may be measures for the purposes of Article 
11.11.1 (Exceptions). 
 
3.  To clarify Malaysia’s commitments with respect to Article 11.5 (Market Access for 
Financial Institutions), juridical persons supplying financial services and constituted under the

juridical form.1 
 
4.  For entries in: 
 
(a)  Section A, all elements of the entry shall be considered in their totality for the 
purpose of its interpretation.  Where there is any discrepancy between the 
Measures element and the Description element of that entry, the Description 
element shall prevail to the extent of that discrepancy. 
 
(b)  Section B, in accordance with Article 11.10.2 (Non-Conforming Measures), 
the Articles specified in the Obligations Concerned element of an entry shall 
not apply to the sectors, subsectors, and activities identified in the Description 
element of that entry. 
   
                                                 
1  For example, partnerships and sole proprietorships are generally not acceptable juridical forms for depository 
financial institutions in Malaysia.  This headnote is not itself intended to affect, or otherwise limit, the choice of 
a financial institution of the other Party between setting up as a branch or subsidiary.

Description:  The carrying on of a licensed business or an approved business 
regulated by Bank Negara Malaysia (the Bank) requires a licence 
by the Minister of Finance or an approval by the Bank, 
respectively.  A licence or an approval will not be granted unless 
the Minister of Finance or the Bank determines that the application 
for licence or approval will be in the best interest of Malaysia.  In 
making a determination, the Minister and the Bank will have regard 
to: 
 
(a)   the effect of the investment on the level and nature 
of economic activity in Malaysia, including the 
effect on productivity, efficiency and quality of 
financial services; 
 
(b)   the contribution towards enhancing international 
trade and investment linkages between Malaysia and 
other countries; 
 
(c)   the effect of the investment on the stability of the 
financial system, including on conduct and 
behaviours that could pose a risk to the financial 
system; or  
 
(d)   the degree and significance of participation of 
Malaysians in the financial sector.3

sector.
