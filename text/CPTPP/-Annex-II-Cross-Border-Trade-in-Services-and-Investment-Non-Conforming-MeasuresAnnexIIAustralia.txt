(a)  the  ability  of  individual  education  and  training  institutions  to  maintain 
autonomy in admissions policies (including in relation to considerations of 
equal  opportunity  for  students  and  recognition  of  credits  and  degrees),  in 
setting tuition rates and in the development of curricula or course content; 
 
(b)  non-discriminatory  accreditation  and  quality  assurance  procedures  for 
education  and  training  institutions  and  their  programmes,  including  the 
standards that must be met; 
 
(c)  government funding, subsidies or grants, such as land grants, preferential tax 
treatment  and  other  public  benefits,  provided  to  education  and  training 
institutions; or 
 
(d)  the  need  for  education  and  training  institutions  to  comply  with  non-
discriminatory requirements related to the establishment and operation of a 
facility in a particular jurisdiction. 
 
2.  For greater certainty, where Australia has more than one entry in its Schedule to 
Annex II that could apply to a measure, each entry is to be read independently, and is without 
prejudice to the application of any other entry to the measure.

21  For the purposes of this entry:  
 
“legal advisory services” – includes provision of advice to and consultation with clients in matters, including 
transactions, relationships and disputes, involving the application or interpretation of law; participation with or on 
behalf of clients in negotiations and other dealings with third parties in such matters; and preparation of documents 
governed in whole or in part by law, and the verification of documents of any kind for purposes of and in accordance

service suppliers entrusted with public functions, such as notary services, or services provided by patent or trade mark 
attorneys. 
 
“legal representational services” – includes preparation of documents intended to be submitted to courts, 
administrative agencies, and other duly constituted official tribunals in matters involving the application and 
interpretation of law; and appearance before courts, administrative agencies, and other duly constituted official 
tribunals in matters involving the application and interpretation of the specified body of law.  (Note: The inclusion of 
representational services before administrative agencies and other duly constituted official tribunals within the 
context of legal services does not necessarily mean that a licensed lawyer must supply such services in all cases.  The 
precise scope of services subject to licensing requirements is subject to the discretion of the relevant regulatory 
authority.)  Does not include documentation services performed by service suppliers entrusted with public functions, 
such as notary services, or services provided by patent or trade mark attorneys. 
 
“legal arbitration, conciliation and mediation services” – preparation of documents to be submitted to, preparation for 
and appearance before, an arbitrator, conciliator or mediator in any dispute involving the application and 
interpretation of law.  Does not include arbitration, conciliation and mediation services in disputes for which the law 
has no bearing which fall under services incidental to management consulting.  As a sub-category, international legal 
arbitration, conciliation and mediation services refer to the same services when the dispute involves parties from two 
or more countries. 
 
“domestic law (host country law)” – the law of Australia.   
 
“foreign law” –  the law of the territories of WTO Members and other countries other than the law of Australia.

For the purposes of these definitions: 
 
“arbitration” is taken to mean a process in which the parties to a dispute present arguments and evidence to a dispute 
resolution practitioner (the arbitrator) who makes a determination.  
 
“mediation” is taken to mean a process in which the parties to a dispute, with the assistance of a dispute resolution 
practitioner (the mediator), identify the disputed issues, develop options, consider alternatives and endeavour to reach 
an agreement.  The mediator has no advisory or determinative role in regard to the content of the dispute or the 
outcome of its resolution, but may advise on or determine the process of mediation whereby resolution is attempted.  
 
“conciliation” is taken to mean a process in which the parties to a dispute, with the assistance of a dispute resolution 
practitioner (the conciliator), identify the issues in dispute, develop options, consider alternatives and endeavour to 
reach an agreement.  The conciliator may have an advisory role on the content of the dispute or the outcome of its 
resolution, but not a determinative role.  The conciliator may advise on or determine the process of conciliation 
whereby resolution is attempted, and may make suggestions for terms of settlement, give expert advice on likely 
settlement terms, and may actively encourage the participants to reach an agreement.
