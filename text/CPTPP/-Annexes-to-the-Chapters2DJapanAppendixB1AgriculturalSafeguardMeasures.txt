agricultural safeguard measures under paragraph 5 of the General 
Notes of the Tariff Schedule of Japan;   
 
(b)  the trigger levels for applying such measures; and   
 
(c)  the maximum rate of customs duty that may be applied in each 
year for each such good.   
 
2.  Notwithstanding Article 2.4 (Elimination of Customs Duties), Japan may 
apply a safeguard measure on specific originating agricultural goods provided for 
in the tariff items indicated with “SG1*”, “SG1**”, “SG2”, “SG3”, “SG4*”, 
“SG4**”, “SG5” or “SG6” in Column “Remarks” in Tariff Schedule of Japan.   
Japan may apply such a safeguard measure only under the conditions set out in 
this Appendix and only in accordance with the terms set out in this Appendix, 
including this Notes. 
 
3.  If the conditions specified in this Appendix have been satisfied, Japan may, 
as an agricultural safeguard measure, increase the rate of customs duty on such an 
originating agricultural good to a level not to exceed the lesser of:   
 
(a)  the most-favoured-nation applied rate of customs duty in effect at 
the time the agricultural safeguard measure is applied;   
 
(b)  the most-favoured-nation applied rate of customs duty in effect on 
the day immediately preceding the date of entry into force of this 
Agreement: 
 
(i)  for Japan, when the agricultural safeguard measure applies 
to originating agricultural goods from all the other Parties; 
and 
 
(ii)  with  respect  to  Japan  and  the  Party  for  which  the 
agricultural safeguard measure applies, when an agricultural 
safeguard measure applies only to originating agricultural 
goods from that one Party; and 
ANNEX 2-D – APPENDIX B-1 – JAPAN – 1  
 
(c)  the rate of customs duty set out in this Appendix. 
   
4.  Japan shall implement any agricultural safeguard measure in a transparent 
manner.  Japan  shall,  within  60  days  of  the  date  of  imposing  the  agricultural 
safeguard  measure,  notify  in  writing  any  other  Party  whose  originating 
agricultural goods are subject to the measure and provide each such other Party 
with relevant data concerning the measure.    Japan shall, on the written request of 
any such other Party, respond to specific questions from, and provide information 
to, that other Party, including by e-mail, teleconference, video-conference and 
in-person, regarding application of the measure. 
 
5.  For the purposes of this Appendix, an originating agricultural good is from 
the Party if the originating agricultural good is wholly obtained in that Party or if 
the last change of tariff heading took place in that Party. 
 
6.  For greater certainty, no agricultural safeguard measure may be applied or 
maintained on or after the date on which the rate of customs duty referred to in 
paragraph 3(c) of this Section is zero.   
 
7.  For the purposes of this Appendix: 
 
(a)  year means: 
 
(i)  with respect to Year 1, the period from the date of entry into 
force of this Agreement for Japan through the following 
March 31; and

originating  agricultural  goods  provided  for  in  the  tariff  items 
indicated with “SG1*” or “SG1**” in Column “Remarks” of the 
Tariff Schedule of Japan from all the other Parties in any quarter

Japan from all the other Parties exceeds the trigger level set out in 
paragraph 1(k) for the respective year, and at the same time the 
aggregate volume of imports of the originating agricultural goods 
provided for in those tariff items from all the other Parties in the 
ANNEX 2-D – APPENDIX B-1 – JAPAN – 6  
quarter exceeds the quarterly safeguard trigger volume set out in 
subparagraph (b), Japan may maintain an agricultural safeguard 
measure under this Section until the later of the end of the 90-day 
period provided for in subparagraph (a) or the date provided for in

6.    If, during any four consecutive fiscal years after Year 15, Japan does not 
apply an agricultural safeguard measure under this Section, Japan shall not apply 
any further agricultural safeguard measures under this Section.

or substantially suspended for more than three years due to sanitary concerns, 
Japan shall not apply an agricultural safeguard measure under this Section to such 
goods from that Party for four years after the whole or substantial lifting of the

Japan shall not apply an agricultural safeguard measure under this Section to such 
goods from that Party shall be five years. 
 
8.  Japan shall not apply the tariff emergency measures on beef referred to in 
Article 7.5 of the Temporary Tariff Measures Law of Japan (Law No.36 of 1960)

“SG1*” in Column “Remarks” of the Tariff Schedule of Japan. 
 
9.  If Year 1 is less than 12 months, the applicable trigger level for Year 1 for 
the purposes of paragraph 1(a) shall be determined by multiplying 590,000 metric 
tonnes by  a fraction the numerator of which shall be the number of  months 
between the date of entry into force of this Agreement for Japan and the following 
March  31  and  the  denominator  of  which  shall  be  12.    For  the  purpose  of 
determining the numerator specified in the previous sentence and for the purpose 
of  determining  the  applicable  trigger  level  in  accordance  with  the  previous 
sentence, any fraction of less than 1.0 shall be rounded to the nearest whole 
number (in the case of 0.5, the fraction shall be rounded to 1.0). 
 
10.  (a)  The aggregate volume  of imports into Japan of the originating 
goods,  as  defined  in  subparagraph  (o)  of  Article  1.2  of  the

under the JAEPA, shall be counted towards the aggregate volume 
of  imports  of  the  originating  agricultural  goods  under  this 
Agreement which are classified under the same tariff lines under 
this Agreement, in determining whether the aggregate volume of 
imports of the originating agricultural goods under this Agreement 
ANNEX 2-D – APPENDIX B-1 – JAPAN – 7

Australia of JAEPA originating goods classified under headings 
02.01 and 02.02 under the JAEPA has exceeded the levels set out in 
subparagraphs 3.(a)(i) and (ii) of Section 1 (Notes for Schedule of

“Remarks” of the Tariff Schedule of Japan under this Agreement 
has not exceeded the levels or volumes set out in paragraph 1 and 
5(b) of this Section, further imports of the originating agricultural 
goods from Australia under this Agreement shall be subject to the 
rate of customs duty which is determined in accordance with the 
Tariff Schedule of Japan. 
 
(c)  For greater certainty, when the aggregate volume of imports of 
originating  agricultural  goods  provided  for  in  the  tariff  items 
indicated with “SG1*” or “SG1**” in Column “Remarks” of the 
Tariff Schedule of Japan under this Agreement has exceeded the

classified under headings 02.01 and 02.02 under the JAEPA has 
exceeded the levels set out in subparagraphs 3.(a)(i) and (ii) of 
Section 1 (Notes for Schedule of Japan) of Part 3 of Annex 1 of the 
JAEPA, then imports of the originating agricultural goods from 
Australia  under  this  Agreement  shall  be  subject  to  the  rate  of 
customs duty which is determined in accordance with this Section. 
 
11.  (a)  In implementing the commitment on originating agricultural goods 
classified  under  headings  02.01  and  02.02,  provided  for  in  the 
Tariff  Schedule  of  Japan,  Japan  and  Australia  agree  that, 
notwithstanding subparagraphs 3.(a)(i) and (ii) of Section 1 (Notes 
for Schedule of Japan) of Part 3 of Annex 1 of the JAEPA, the 
aggregate volume of imports of the originating agricultural goods 
classified under headings 02.01 and 02.02 from Australia under 
this Agreement shall be counted towards the aggregate volume of 
imports of the JAEPA originating goods, which are classified under 
the same tariff lines under the JAEPA, in determining whether the 
aggregate volume of those JAEPA originating goods exceeds the 
level set out in subparagraphs 3.(a)(i) and (ii) of Section 1 (Notes 
for Schedule of Japan) of Part 3 of Annex 1 of the JAEPA. 
 
(b)  For the purposes of ensuring the appropriate functioning of special 
safeguard measures under subparagraphs 3.(a)(i) and (ii) of Section 
1 (Notes for Schedule of Japan) of Part 3 of Annex 1 of the JAEPA 
ANNEX 2-D – APPENDIX B-1 – JAPAN – 8  
to avoid a sudden increase in total import of the originating goods 
as defined in subparagraph (o) of Article 1.2 of the JAEPA which 
are classified under headings 02.01 and 02.02 under the JAEPA, on 
request  of  a  Party  which  imports  such  originating  goods,  the 
requested Party and the requesting Party shall hold a consultation 
on the application of subparagraph (a).   
 
(c)  For greater certainty, when the aggregate volume of imports of 
originating  agricultural  goods  provided  for  in  the  tariff  items 
indicated with “SG1*” or “SG1**” in Column “Remarks” of the 
Tariff Schedule of Japan under this Agreement has exceeded the 
levels or volumes set out in paragraphs 1 and 5(b) of this Section, 
but  the  aggregate  volume  of  imports  from  Australia  of  JAEPA 
originating goods classified under headings 02.01 and 02.02 under 
the JAEPA has not exceeded the levels set out in subparagraphs 
3.(a)(i) and (ii) of Section 1 (Notes for Schedule of Japan) of Part 3 
of Annex 1 of the JAEPA, further imports of the JAEPA originating 
goods from Australia under the JAEPA shall be subject to the rate 
of customs duty which is determined in accordance with Section 1 
(Notes for Schedule of Japan) of Part 3 of Annex 1 of the JAEPA.

Party for the respective year exceeds 115 per cent of the largest 
annual aggregate volume of imports of SG3 goods from that Party 
during any of the preceding three fiscal years; 
 
(b)  in  Year  3  through  Year  6,  Japan  may  apply  an  agricultural 
safeguard  measure  under  this  Section  on  SG3  goods  from  an 
individual Party only if the aggregate volume of imports of SG3 
goods from that other Party for the respective year exceeds 118 per 
cent of the largest annual aggregate volume of imports of SG3 
goods from that individual Party during any of the preceding three 
fiscal years; and 
 
(c)  in  Year  7  through  Year  11,  Japan  may  apply  an  agricultural 
safeguard  measure  under  this  Section  on  SG3  goods  from  an 
individual Party only if the aggregate volume of imports of SG3 
goods from that other Party for the respective year exceeds 121 per 
cent of the largest annual aggregate volume of imports of SG3 
goods from that individual Party during any of the preceding three 
fiscal years. 
 
2.  (a)  For SG3 goods, the rate of customs duty referred to in paragraph 
3(c) of Section A to this Appendix shall be:

(b)  For the purposes of this paragraph, the base rate shall be comprised 
of an ad valorem duty component and a specific duty component, 
each of which shall be reduced to the percentages identified in 
subparagraph (a) to determine the rate of customs duty referred to 
in paragraph 3(c) of Section A to this Appendix.   The ad valorem 
ANNEX 2-D – APPENDIX B-1 – JAPAN – 15  
duty component of the base rate shall be 8.5 per cent, and the 
specific  duty  component  shall  be  equal  to  614.85  yen  per 
kilogramme  minus  60  per  cent  of  the  CIF  import  price  per 
kilogramme of the respective SG3 good.

6.  If Year 1 is less than 12 months, the applicable trigger level for SG3 goods 
from an individual Party for Year 1 for the purposes of paragraph 1(a) shall be 
determined by multiplying 115 per cent of the largest annual aggregate volume of 
imports of SG3 goods from that Party during any of the preceding three fiscal 
years by a fraction the numerator of which shall be the number of months between 
the date of entry into force of this Agreement for Japan and the following March 
31 and the denominator of which shall be 12.    For the purpose of determining the 
numerator specified in the previous sentence and for the purpose of determining 
the applicable trigger level in accordance with the previous sentence, any fraction 
of less than 1.0 shall be rounded to the nearest whole number (in the case of 0.5, 
the fraction shall be rounded to 1.0).

accordance with Article 30.5.4 and Article 30.5.5 (Entry into Force), and: 
 
(a)  the date of entry into force of this Agreement for that Party is not 
April 1; and 
 
(b)  the period between the date of entry into force of this Agreement 
for that Party and the following March 31 is not Year 1,

would be applicable pursuant to paragraph 1 if it were a complete year by a 
fraction the numerator of which shall be the number of months between the date 
of entry into force of this Agreement for that Party and the following March 31 
and the denominator of which shall be 12.    For the purpose of determining the 
numerator specified in the previous sentence and for the purpose of determining 
the applicable trigger level in accordance with the previous sentence, any fraction 
of less than 1.0 shall be rounded to the nearest whole number (in the case of 0.5,
