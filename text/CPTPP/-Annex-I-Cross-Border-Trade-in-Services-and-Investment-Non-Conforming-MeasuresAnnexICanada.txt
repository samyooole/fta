Description: 
Investment 
 
1. 
Except as set out in paragraphs 3 and 7, the Director of 
Investments will review a direct “acquisition of control”, as 
defined in the Investment Canada Act, of a Canadian business 
by an investor of an original signatory for which the Agreement 
has entered into force pursuant to Article 30.5 (Entry into Force) 
if the value of the Canadian business is not less than C$1.5 
billion, adjusted in accordance with the applicable methodology 
in January of each subsequent year as set out in the Investment 
Canada Act. 
 
2. 
Notwithstanding the definition of “investor of a Party” in 
Article 9.1 (Definitions), only investors who are nationals of an 
original signatory for which the Agreement has entered into 
force pursuant to Article 30.5 (Entry into Force), or entities 
controlled by nationals of those Parties, as provided for in the 
Investment Canada Act, may benefit from the higher review 
threshold. 
 
3. 
The higher threshold in paragraph 1 does not apply to a 
direct “acquisition of control” of a Canadian business by a state 
owned enterprise of a Party.  Such acquisitions are subject to 
review by the Director of Investments if the value of the 
Canadian business is not less than C$369 million, adjusted in 
accordance with the applicable methodology in January of each 
 
ANNEX I – CANADA – 3 
subsequent year as set out in the Investment Canada Act. 
 
4. 
An investment subject to review under the Investment 
Canada Act may not be implemented unless the Minister 
responsible for the Investment Canada Act advises the applicant 
that the investment is likely to be of net benefit to Canada.  This 
determination is made in accordance with six factors described 
in the Act, summarised as follows: 
 
(a) 
the effect of the investment on the level and 
nature of economic activity in Canada, including 
the effect on employment, on the use of parts, 
components and services produced in Canada, 
and on exports from Canada; 
 
(b) 
the degree and significance of participation by 
Canadians in the investment; 
 
(c) 
the effect of the investment on productivity, 
industrial efficiency, technological development 
and product innovation in Canada; 
 
(d) 
the effect of the investment on competition 
within an industry or industries in Canada; 
 
(e) 
the compatibility of the investment with national 
industrial, economic and cultural policies, taking 
into consideration industrial, economic and 
cultural policy objectives enunciated by the 
government or legislature of any province likely 
to be significantly affected by the investment; 
and  
 
(f) 
the contribution of the investment to Canada’s 
ability to compete in world markets. 
 
5. 
In making a net benefit determination, the Minister, 
through the Director of Investments, may review plans under 
which the applicant demonstrates the net benefit to Canada of 
the proposed acquisition.  An applicant may also submit 
undertakings to the Minister in connection with a proposed 
acquisition that is the subject of review.  In the event of non-
compliance with an undertaking by an applicant, the Minister 
may seek a court order directing compliance or any other 
remedy authorised under the Investment Canada Act. 
 
6. 
A non-Canadian who establishes or acquires a Canadian 
 
ANNEX I – CANADA – 4 
business, other than those that are subject to review as described 
above, must notify the Director of Investments. 
 
7. 
The review thresholds set out in paragraphs 1 and 3 do 
not apply to an acquisition of a cultural business. 
 
8. 
In addition, the specific acquisition or establishment of a 
new business in designated types of business activities relating 
to Canada’s cultural heritage or national identity, which are 
normally notifiable, may be subject to review if the Governor-
in-Council authorises a review in the public interest. 
 
9. 
An indirect “acquisition of control” of a Canadian 
business by an investor of a Party in a sector other than a 
cultural business is not reviewable.   
 
10. 
Notwithstanding Article 9.10 (Performance 
Requirements), Canada may impose requirements, or enforce a 
commitment or undertaking in connection with the 
establishment, acquisition, expansion, conduct or operation of 
an investment of an investor of a Party or of a non-Party for the 
transfer of technology, production process or other proprietary 
knowledge to a national or enterprise, affiliated to the transferor, 
in Canada in connection with the review of an acquisition of an 
investment under the Investment Canada Act.  
 
11. 
Except for requirements, commitments or undertakings 
relating to technology transfer as set out in paragraph 10 of this 
entry, Article 9.10 (Performance Requirements) applies to 
requirements, commitments or undertakings imposed or 
enforced under the Investment Canada Act.   
 
12. 
For the purposes of this entry: a “non-Canadian” means 
an individual, government or agency thereof or an entity that is 
not Canadian; and “Canadian” means a Canadian citizen or 
permanent resident, a government in Canada or agency thereof, 
or a Canadian-controlled entity as described in the Investment 
Canada Act.

Description: 
Investment 
 
1. 
A corporation or distributing cooperative may place 
constraints on the issue, transfer and ownership of shares in a 
federally incorporated corporation or cooperative.  The object 
of those constraints is to permit a corporation or cooperative to 
meet Canadian ownership or control requirements, under certain 
laws set out in the Canada Business Corporations Act 
Regulations and Canada Cooperatives Regulations, in sectors 
where ownership or control is required as a condition to operate 
or to receive licences, permits, grants, payments or other 
benefits.  In order to maintain certain Canadian ownership 
levels, a corporation is permitted to sell shareholders’ shares 
without the consent of those shareholders, and to purchase its 
own shares on the open market.   
 
2. 
The Canada Cooperatives Act provides that constraints 
may be placed on the issue or transfer of investment of shares of 
a cooperative to persons not resident in Canada to permit 
cooperatives to meet Canadian ownership requirements to 
obtain a licence to carry on a business, to become a publisher of 
a Canadian newspaper or periodicals or to acquire shares of a 
financial intermediary and in sectors where ownership or 
control is a required condition to receive licences, permits, 
grants, payments and other benefits.  Where the ownership or 
control of investment of shares would adversely affect the 
ability of a cooperative to maintain a level of Canadian 
ownership or control, the Canada Cooperatives Act provides for 
the limitation of the number of investment shares that may be 
owned or for the prohibition of the ownership of investment 
shares.

Under the Canada Oil and Gas Operations Act, a 
benefits plan must be approved by the Minister responsible for 
the Act in order to proceed with an oil and gas development

2. 
A “benefits plan” is a plan for the employment of 
Canadians and for providing Canadian manufacturers, 
consultants, contractors and service companies with a full and 
fair opportunity to participate on a competitive basis in the 
supply of goods and services used in proposed work or activity 
referred to in the benefits plan. 
 
 
ANNEX I – CANADA – 18 
3. 
The benefits plan contemplated by the Canada Oil and 
Gas Operations Act permits the Minister responsible for the Act 
to impose on the applicant an additional requirement to ensure 
that disadvantaged individuals or groups have access to training 
and employment opportunities or can participate in the supply 
of goods and services used in proposed work activity referred to 
in the benefits plan.

deemed, once concluded, to be existing measures. 
 
6. 
The Canada - Nova Scotia Offshore Petroleum 
Resources Accord Implementation Act and the Canada - 
Newfoundland Atlantic Accord Implementation Act have the 
same requirement for a benefits plan but also require that the 
benefits plan ensures that: 
 
(a) 
the corporation or other body submitting the plan 
establishes in the applicable province an office 
where appropriate levels of decision-making are 
to take place, prior to carrying out any work or 
activity in the offshore area; 
 
(b) 
expenditures be made for research and 
development to be carried out in the province, 
and for education and training to be provided in 
the province; and 
 
(c) 
first consideration be given to goods produced or 
services supplied from within the province, 
where those goods or services are competitive in 
terms of fair market price, quality and delivery. 
 
7. 
The Boards administering the benefits plan under these 
Acts may also require that the plan include provisions to ensure 
that disadvantaged individuals or groups, or corporations owned 
or cooperatives operated by them, participate in the supply of 
goods and services used in proposed work or activity referred to 
in the plan.

is in fact “Canadian-controlled” as defined in the Investment 
Canada Act. 
 
2. 
Exemptions from the Policy on Non-Resident 
Ownership in the Uranium Mining Sector are permitted, subject 
to approval of the Governor-in-Council, only in cases where 
Canadian participants in the ownership of the property are not 
available.  Investments in properties by non-Canadians, made 
prior to December 23, 1987 and that are beyond the permitted 
ownership level, may remain in place.  No increase in 
non-Canadian ownership is permitted.

The Canada Transportation Act, in Section 55, defines 
“Canadian” as: “a Canadian citizen or a permanent resident 
within the meaning of the Immigration and Refugee Protection 
Act, a government in Canada or an agent of such a government or 
a corporation or other entity that is incorporated or formed under 
the laws of Canada or a province, that is controlled in fact by 
Canadians and of which at least 75 per cent, or such lesser 
percentage as the Governor in Council may by regulation specify, 
of the voting interests are owned and controlled by Canadians.” 
 
2. 
Regulations made under the Aeronautics Act incorporate 
by reference the definition of “Canadian” found in the Canada 
Transportation Act.  These Regulations require that a Canadian 
operator of commercial air services operate Canadian-registered 
aircraft.  These regulations require an operator to be Canadian 
in order to obtain a Canadian Air Operator Certificate and to 
qualify to register aircraft as “Canadian”.

Only “Canadians” may supply the following commercial 
air transportation services: 
 
(a) 
“domestic services” (air services between points, 
 
ANNEX I – CANADA – 23 
or from and to the same point, in the territory of 
Canada, or between a point in the territory of 
Canada and a point not in the territory of another 
country); 
 
(b) 
“scheduled international services” (scheduled air 
services between a point in the territory of 
Canada and a point in the territory of another 
country) where those services have been 
reserved to Canadian carriers under existing or 
future air services agreements; 
 
(c) 
“non-scheduled international services” (non-
scheduled air services between a point in the 
territory of Canada and a point in the territory of 
another country) where those services have been 
reserved to Canadian carriers under the Canada 
Transportation Act; and 
 
(d) 
“specialty air services” (include, but are not 
limited to: aerial mapping, aerial surveying, 
aerial photography, forest fire management, fire-
fighting, aerial advertising, glider towing, 
parachute jumping, aerial construction, heli-
logging, aerial inspection, aerial surveillance, 
flight training, aerial sightseeing and aerial crop 
spraying). 
 
4. 
No foreign individual is qualified to be the registered 
owner of a Canadian-registered aircraft. 
 
5. 
Further to the Canadian Aviation Regulations, a 
corporation incorporated in Canada, but that does not meet the 
Canadian ownership and control requirements, may only 
register an aircraft for private use where a significant majority 
of use of the aircraft (at least 60 per cent) is in Canada. 
 
6. 
The Canadian Aviation Regulations also have the effect 
of limiting foreign-registered private aircraft registered to “non-
Canadian” corporations to be present in Canada for a maximum 
of 90 days per 12-month period.  Such foreign-registered 
private aircraft would be limited to private use, as would be the 
case for Canadian-registered aircraft requiring a private 
operating certificate.

the applicant, if an individual, is resident or, if an enterprise, is 
constituted or organised, provides Canadian specialty air service 
operators reciprocal access to supply specialty air services in 
that country’s territory.  Any foreign service supplier authorised 
to supply specialty air services is required to comply with 
Canadian safety requirements while supplying such services in 
Canada.

service suppliers that have revenues, including 
those of its affiliates, from the supply of 
telecommunications services in Canada 
representing less than 10 per cent of the total 
telecommunications services annual revenues 
in Canada.  Facilities-based 
telecommunications service suppliers that 
previously had annual revenues, including 
those of their affiliates, from the supply of 
telecommunications services in Canada 
representing less than 10 per cent of the total 
telecommunications services annual revenues 
in Canada may increase to 10 per cent or 
beyond as long as the increase in such revenues 
did not result from the acquisition of control 
of, or the acquisition of assets used to supply 
telecommunications services by, another 
facilities-based telecommunications service 
supplier that is subject to the legislative 
authority of the Parliament of Canada.
