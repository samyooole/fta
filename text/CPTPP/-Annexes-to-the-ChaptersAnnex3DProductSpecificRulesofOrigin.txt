ANNEX 3-D 
 
PRODUCT-SPECIFIC RULES OF ORIGIN 
 
 
Section A:  General Interpretative Notes 
 
1. 
For the purposes of interpreting the product-specific rules of origin set out 
in this Annex, the following definitions shall apply: 
 
section means a section of the Harmonized System; 
 
chapter means a chapter of the Harmonized System;  
 
heading means the first four digits of the tariff classification number under the 
Harmonized System; and 
 
subheading means the first six digits of the tariff classification number under the 
Harmonized System. 
 
2. 
Under this Annex, a good is an originating good if it is produced entirely 
in the territory of one or more of the Parties by one or more producers using non-
originating materials, and: 
 
(a) 
each of the non-originating materials used in the production of the 
good satisfies any applicable change in tariff classification 
requirement, or the good otherwise satisfies the production 
process requirement, regional value content requirement, or any 
other requirement specified in this Annex; and  
 
(b) 
the good satisfies all other applicable requirements of Chapter 3 
(Rules of Origin and Origin Procedures). 
 
3. 
For the purposes of interpreting the product-specific rules of origin set out 
in this Annex: 
 
(a) 
the specific rule, or specific set of rules, that applies to a particular 
heading, subheading or group of headings or subheadings is set out 
immediately adjacent to the heading, subheading or group of 
headings or subheadings; 
 
(b) 
section, chapter or heading notes, where applicable, are found at 
the beginning of each section or chapter, and are read in 
conjunction with the product-specific rules of origin and may 
impose further conditions on, or provide an alternative to the 
product-specific rules of origin;  
ANNEX 3-D – 2 
 
(c) 
the requirement of a change in tariff classification shall apply only 
to non-originating materials; 
 
(d) 
if a product-specific rule of origin excludes certain materials of the 
Harmonized System, it shall be construed to mean that the product-
specific rule of origin requires that the excluded materials be 
originating for the good to be originating; 
 
(e) 
if a good is subject to alternative product-specific rules of origin, 
the good shall be originating if it satisfies one of the alternatives;  
 
(f) 
if a good is subject to a product-specific rule of origin that includes 
multiple requirements, the good shall be originating only if it 
satisfies all of the requirements; and 
 
(g) 
if a single product-specific rule of origin applies to a group of 
headings or subheadings and that rule of origin specifies a change 
of heading or subheading, it shall be understood that the change in 
heading or subheading may occur from any other heading or 
subheading, as the case may be, including from any other heading 
or subheading within the group. 
 
4. 
The product-specific rules of origin for textile or apparel goods as defined 
in Chapter 4 (Textile and Apparel Goods) are contained in Annex 4-A (Textiles 
and Apparel Product-Specific Rules of Origin). 
 
5. 
For goods of chapters 84 and 87 marked with a symbol ( † ), an optional 
methodology for satisfying the regional value content requirement of the product-
specific rule of origin shall apply.  This methodology is contained in Appendix 1 
(Provisions Related to the Product-Specific Rules of Origin for Certain Vehicles 
and Parts of Vehicles) to this Annex.

MINERAL FUELS, MINERAL OILS AND PRODUCTS OF THEIR 
DISTILLATION; BITUMINOUS SUBSTANCES; MINERAL WAXES 
Chapter Note 1: Chemical Reaction Rule 
 
Notwithstanding the applicable product-specific rules of origin, a good of 
chapter 27 that is the product of a chemical reaction is an originating good if the 
chemical reaction occurred in the territory of one or more of the Parties. 
 
For the purposes of this rule, a “chemical reaction” is a process (including a 
biochemical process) which results in a molecule with a new structure by 
breaking intramolecular bonds and by forming new intramolecular bonds, or by 
altering the spatial arrangement of atoms in a molecule. 
 
The following are not chemical reactions: 
     (a) dissolving in water or other solvents; 
     (b) the elimination of solvents, including solvent water; or 
     (c) the addition or elimination of water of crystallisation. 
Heading Note 1: Distillation Rule 
 
Notwithstanding the applicable product-specific rules of origin, a good of 
heading 27.10 that undergoes atmospheric or vacuum distillation in the territory 
of one or more of the Parties is an originating good.  
 
For the purposes of this rule: 
 
     (a) Atmospheric distillation means a separation process in which petroleum 
oils are converted, in a distillation tower, into fractions according to boiling 
ANNEX 3-D – 46 
HS Classification (HS2012) 
Product-Specific Rule of Origin 
point and the vapour then condensed into different liquefied fractions.  Goods 
produced from petroleum distillation may include liquefied petroleum gas, 
naphtha, gasoline, kerosene, diesel/heating oil, light gas oils and lubricating oil; 
and 
 
     (b) Vacuum distillation means distillation at a pressure below atmospheric 
but not so low that it would be classed as molecular distillation.  Vacuum 
distillation is used for distilling high-boiling and heat-sensitive materials such as 
heavy distillates in petroleum oils to produce light to heavy vacuum gas oils and 
residuum.  In some refineries, gas oils may be further processed into lubricating 
oils. 
Heading Note 2: Direct Blending Rule 
 
Notwithstanding the applicable product-specific rules of origin, a good of 
heading 27.10 that undergoes “direct blending” in the territory of one or more of 
the Parties is an originating good.  For the purposes of this rule, “direct 
blending” means a process whereby various petroleum streams from processing 
units or petroleum components from holding or storage tanks are combined to 
create a finished product with pre-determined parameters, provided that the non-
originating material of heading 27.10 constitutes no more than 25 per cent by 
volume of the good and no component of that non-originating material is 
classified under heading 22.07. 
Heading Note 3: Diluent Rule  
 
For the purposes of determining whether or not a good of heading 27.09 is an 
originating good, the origin of diluent of heading 27.09 or 27.10 that is used to 
facilitate the transportation between Parties of crude petroleum oils and crude 
oils obtained from bituminous minerals of heading 27.09 is disregarded, 
provided that the diluent constitutes no more than 40 per cent by volume of the 
good.

SECTION VI 
PRODUCTS OF THE CHEMICAL OR ALLIED INDUSTRIES 
Section Note 1: Chemical Reaction Rule 
 
Notwithstanding the applicable product-specific rules of origin, a good of 
chapter 28 through 38 that is the product of a chemical reaction is an originating 
good if the chemical reaction occurred in the territory of one or more of the 
Parties. 
 
For the purposes of this rule, a “chemical reaction” is a process (including a 
biochemical process) which results in a molecule with a new structure by 
breaking intramolecular bonds and by forming new intramolecular bonds, or by 
altering the spatial arrangement of atoms in a molecule. 
 
The following are not chemical reactions: 
     (a) dissolving in water or other solvents; 
     (b) the elimination of solvents, including solvent water; or 
     (c) the addition or elimination of water of crystallisation. 
Section Note 2: Purification Rule 
 
Notwithstanding the applicable product-specific rules of origin, a good of 
chapter 28 through 35 or chapter 38, that is subject to purification is an 
originating good if that purification occurs in the territory of one or more of the 
Parties and results in the elimination of not less than 80 per cent of the content 
of existing impurities. 
Section Note 3: Mixing and Blending Rule 
 
Notwithstanding the applicable product-specific rules of origin, a good of 
chapter 30 or 31, heading 33.02 or 37.07, is an originating good if, in the 
territory of one or more of the Parties, the deliberate and proportionally 
controlled mixing or blending (including dispersing) of materials to conform to 
predetermined specifications results in the production of a good having physical 
or chemical characteristics that are relevant to the purposes or uses of the good 
and are different from the input materials.

in the territory of one or more of the Parties, the deliberate and controlled 
modification in particle size of a good occurs, including micronizing by 
dissolving a polymer and subsequent precipitation, other than by merely 
crushing or pressing, resulting in a good with a defined particle size, defined 
particle size distribution or defined surface area, that is relevant to the purposes 
of the resulting good and with different physical or chemical characteristics 
from the input materials. 
Section Note 5: Standards Materials Rule 
 
Notwithstanding the applicable product-specific rules of origin, a standards 
material of chapter 28 through 38, except for a good of heading 35.01 through 
35.05 or subheading 3824.60, is an originating good if the production of such 
good occurs in the territory of one or more of the Parties. 
 
For the purposes of this rule, a “standards material” (including a standard 
solution) is a preparation suitable for analytical, calibrating or referencing uses 
with precise degrees of purity or proportions certified by the manufacturer.

chemical reaction occurs in the territory of one or more of the Parties. 
 
For the purposes of this rule, a “chemical reaction” is a process (including a 
biochemical process) which results in a molecule with a new structure by 
breaking intramolecular bonds and by forming new intramolecular bonds, or by 
altering the spatial arrangement of atoms in a molecule.  
 
The following are not chemical reactions: 
     (a) dissolving in water or other solvents; 
     (b) the elimination of solvents, including solvent water; or 
     (c) the addition or elimination of water of crystallisation. 
This definition comprises all types of polymerization reactions.
