 
 
ANNEX 3-D 
 
PRODUCT-SPECIFIC RULES OF ORIGIN 
 
 
Section A:  General Interpretative Notes 
 
1.  For the purposes of interpreting the product-specific rules of origin set out 
in this Annex, the following definitions shall apply: 
 
section means a section of the Harmonized System; 
 
chapter means a chapter of the Harmonized System;  
 
heading means the first four digits of the tariff classification number under the 
Harmonized System; and 
 
subheading means the first six digits of the tariff classification number under the 
Harmonized System. 
 
2.  Under this Annex, a good is an originating good if it is produced entirely 
in the territory of one or more of the Parties by one or more producers using non-
originating materials, and: 
 
(a)  each of the non-originating materials used in the production of the 
good  satisfies  any  applicable  change  in  tariff  classification 
requirement,  or  the  good  otherwise  satisfies  the  production 
process requirement, regional value content requirement, or any 
other requirement specified in this Annex; and  
 
(b)  the good satisfies all other applicable requirements of Chapter 3 
(Rules of Origin and Origin Procedures). 
 
3.  For the purposes of interpreting the product-specific rules of origin set out 
in this Annex: 
 
(a)  the specific rule, or specific set of rules, that applies to a particular 
heading, subheading or group of headings or subheadings is set out 
immediately  adjacent  to  the  heading,  subheading  or  group  of 
headings or subheadings; 
 
(b)  section, chapter or heading notes, where applicable, are found at 
the  beginning  of  each  section  or  chapter,  and  are  read  in 
conjunction  with  the  product-specific  rules  of  origin  and  may 
impose  further  conditions  on,  or  provide  an  alternative  to  the 
product-specific rules of origin;  
ANNEX 3-D – 1  
(c)  the requirement of a change in tariff classification shall apply only 
to non-originating materials; 
 
(d)  if a product-specific rule of origin excludes certain materials of the 
Harmonized System, it shall be construed to mean that the product-
specific  rule  of  origin  requires  that  the  excluded  materials  be 
originating for the good to be originating; 
 
(e)  if a good is subject to alternative product-specific rules of origin, 
the good shall be originating if it satisfies one of the alternatives;  
 
(f)  if a good is subject to a product-specific rule of origin that includes 
multiple  requirements,  the  good  shall  be  originating  only  if  it 
satisfies all of the requirements; and 
 
(g)  if a single product-specific rule of origin applies to a group of 
headings or subheadings and that rule of origin specifies a change 
of heading or subheading, it shall be understood that the change in 
heading  or  subheading  may  occur  from  any  other  heading  or 
subheading, as the case may be, including from any other heading 
or subheading within the group. 
 
4.  The product-specific rules of origin for textile or apparel goods as defined 
in Chapter 4 (Textile and Apparel Goods) are contained in Annex 4-A (Textiles 
and Apparel Product-Specific Rules of Origin). 
 
5.  For goods of chapters 84 and 87 marked with a symbol ( † ), an optional 
methodology for satisfying the regional value content requirement of the product-
specific rule of origin shall apply.  This methodology is contained in Appendix 1 
(Provisions Related to the Product-Specific Rules of Origin for Certain Vehicles 
and Parts of Vehicles) to this Annex.
