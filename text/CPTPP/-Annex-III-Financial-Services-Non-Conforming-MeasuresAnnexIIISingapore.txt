accorded to depositors in the home country vis-à-vis depositors in Singapore, 
and the amount of assets held or situated in Singapore.

respect to a foreign bank of another Party, unless it: 
 
(i) 
notifies the bank and the other Party of its intent at least six months 
before imposing the requirement; 
 
(ii) 
consults with the other Party concerning the requirement and gives due 
consideration to the views expressed by the other Party in this respect; 
and 
 
(iii) 
allows the bank a reasonable time to comply with the requirement.

apply to the non-conforming measures identified in the Description element of that entry.
