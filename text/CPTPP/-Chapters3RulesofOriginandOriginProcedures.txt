Article 3.4:  Treatment of Recovered Materials Used in Production of a 
Remanufactured Good 
 
1. 
Each Party shall provide that a recovered material derived in the territory 
of one or more of the Parties is treated as originating when it is used in the 
production of, and incorporated into, a remanufactured good. 
 
2. For greater certainty: 
 
(a) 
a remanufactured good is originating only if it satisfies the 
applicable requirements of Article 3.2 (Originating Goods); and 
 
(b) 
a recovered material that is not used or incorporated in the 
production of a remanufactured good is originating only if it 
satisfies the applicable requirements of Article 3.2 (Originating

Article 3.5:  Regional Value Content  
 
1. 
Each Party shall provide that a regional value content requirement 
specified in this Chapter, including related Annexes, to determine whether a good 
is originating, is calculated as follows: 
 
(a) 
Focused Value Method: Based on the Value of Specified Non-
Originating Materials 
 
   Value of the Good – FVNM  
RVC =   x 100 
Value of the Good 
 
 
3-4 
 
(b) 
Build-down Method:  Based on the Value of Non-Originating 
Materials  
 
   Value of the Good – VNM 
RVC =   x 100 
        Value of the Good 
 
(c) 
Build-up Method: Based on the Value of Originating Materials  
 
 
              VOM 
RVC =    x 100 
 Value of the Good 
 
or  
 
(d) 
Net Cost Method (for Automotive Goods Only) 
 
    NC - VNM 
RVC =   x 100 
    NC 
where: 
 
RVC is the regional value content of a good, expressed as a percentage; 
 
VNM is the value of non-originating materials, including materials of 
undetermined origin, used in the production of the good; 
 
NC is the net cost of the good determined in accordance with Article 3.9 (Net 
Cost); 
 
FVNM is the value of non-originating materials, including materials of 
undetermined origin, specified in the applicable product-specific-rule (PSR) in 
Annex 3-D (Product-Specific Rules of Origin) and used in the production of the 
good.  For greater certainty, non-originating materials that are not specified in the 
applicable PSR in Annex 3-D (Product-Specific Rules of Origin) are not taken 
into account for the purpose of determining FVNM; and 
 
VOM is the value of originating materials used in the production of the good in 
the territory of one or more of the Parties. 
 
2. 
Each Party shall provide that all costs considered for the calculation of 
regional value content are recorded and maintained in conformity with the 
Generally Accepted Accounting Principles applicable in the territory of a Party 
where the good is produced. 
 
 
 
3-5 
 
Article 3.6:  Materials Used in Production 
 
1. 
Each Party shall provide that if a non-originating material undergoes 
further production such that it satisfies the requirements of this Chapter, the 
material is treated as originating when determining the originating status of the 
subsequently produced good, regardless of whether that material was produced by 
the producer of the good. 
 
2. 
Each Party shall provide that if a non-originating material is used in the 
production of a good, the following may be counted as originating content for the 
purpose of determining whether the good meets a regional value content 
requirement: 
 
(a) 
the value of processing of the non-originating materials undertaken 
in the territory of one or more of the Parties; and  
 
(b) 
the value of any originating material used in the production of the 
non-originating material undertaken in the territory of one or more 
of the Parties. 
 
 
Article 3.7:  Value of Materials Used in Production 
 
Each Party shall provide that for the purposes of this Chapter, the value of 
a material is: 
 
(a) 
for a material imported by the producer of the good, the transaction 
value of the material at the time of importation, including the costs 
incurred in the international shipment of the material; 
 
(b) 
for a material acquired in the territory where the good is produced: 
 
(i) 
the price paid or payable by the producer in the Party where 
the producer is located; 
 
(ii) 
the value as determined for an imported material in 
subparagraph (a); or 
 
(iii) 
the earliest ascertainable price paid or payable in the 
territory of the Party; or 
 
(c) 
for a material that is self-produced: 
 
(i) 
all the costs incurred in the production of the material, 
which includes general expenses; and  
 
 
3-6 
 
(ii) 
an amount equivalent to the profit added in the normal 
course of trade, or equal to the profit that is usually 
reflected in the sale of goods of the same class or kind as 
the self-produced material that is being valued. 
 
 
Article 3.8:  Further Adjustments to the Value of Materials 
 
1. 
Each Party shall provide that for an originating material, the following 
expenses may be added to the value of the material, if not included under Article 
3.7 (Value of Materials Used in Production): 
 
(a) 
the costs of freight, insurance, packing and all other costs incurred 
to transport the material to the location of the producer of the good; 
 
(b) 
duties, taxes and customs brokerage fees on the material, paid in 
the territory of one or more of the Parties, other than duties and 
taxes that are waived, refunded, refundable or otherwise 
recoverable, which include credit against duty or tax paid or 
payable; and 
 
(c) 
the cost of waste and spoilage resulting from the use of the material 
in the production of the good, less the value of reusable scrap or 
by-product. 
 
2. 
Each Party shall provide that, for a non-originating material or material of 
undetermined origin, the following expenses may be deducted from the value of 
the material: 
 
(a) 
the costs of freight, insurance, packing and all other costs incurred 
in transporting the material to the location of the producer of the 
good; 
 
(b) 
duties, taxes and customs brokerage fees on the material paid in the 
territory of one or more of the Parties, other than duties and taxes 
that are waived, refunded, refundable or otherwise recoverable, 
which include credit against duty or tax paid or payable; and 
 
(c) 
the cost of waste and spoilage resulting from the use of the material 
in the production of the good, less the value of reusable scrap or 
by-product. 
 
3. 
If the cost or expense listed in paragraph 1 or 2 is unknown or 
documentary evidence of the amount of the adjustment is not available, then no 
adjustment is allowed for that particular cost. 
 
 
 
3-7 
 
Article 3.9:  Net Cost 
 
1.

87.01 through 87.09 or heading 87.11 is originating, each Party shall provide that 
the requirement to determine the origin of that good based on the Net Cost 
Method is calculated as set out under Article 3.5 (Regional Value Content). 
 
2. 
For the purposes of this Article: 
 
(a) 
net cost means total cost minus sales promotion, marketing and 
after-sales service costs, royalties, shipping and packing costs, and 
non-allowable interest costs that are included in the total cost; and  
 
(b)  
net cost of the good means the net cost that can be reasonably 
allocated to the good, using one of the following methods: 
 
(i) 
calculating the total cost incurred with respect to all 
automotive goods produced by that producer, subtracting 
any sales promotion, marketing and after-sales service 
costs, royalties, shipping and packing costs, and non-
allowable interest costs that are included in the total cost of 
all those goods, and then reasonably allocating the resulting 
net cost of those goods to the good; 
 
(ii) 
calculating the total cost incurred with respect to all 
automotive goods produced by that producer, reasonably 
allocating the total cost to the good, and then subtracting 
any sales promotion, marketing and after-sales service 
costs; royalties, shipping and packing costs, and non-
allowable interest costs that are included in the portion of 
the total cost allocated to the good; or 
 
(iii) 
reasonably allocating each cost that forms part of the total 
cost incurred with respect to the good, so that the aggregate 
of these costs does not include any sales promotion, 
marketing and after-sales service costs, royalties, shipping 
and packing costs, and non-allowable interest costs, 
provided that the allocation of all those costs is consistent 
with the provisions regarding the reasonable allocation of 
costs set out in Generally Accepted Accounting Principles. 
 
3. 
Each Party shall provide that, for the purposes of the Net Cost Method for 
motor vehicles of heading 87.01 through 87.06 or heading 87.11, the calculation 
may be averaged over the producer’s fiscal year using any one of the following 
categories, on the basis of all motor vehicles in the category or only those motor 
vehicles in the category that are exported to the territory of another Party: 
 
3-8 
 
 
(a) 
the same model line of motor vehicles in the same class of motor 
vehicles produced in the same plant in the territory of a Party; 
 
(b) 
the same class of motor vehicles produced in the same plant in the 
territory of a Party;

paragraphs 1 and 2, for automotive materials of subheading 8407.31 through 
8407.34, 8408.20, heading 84.09, 87.06, 87.07, or 87.08, produced in the same 
plant, a calculation may be averaged: 
 
(a) 
over the fiscal year of the motor vehicle producer to whom the 
good is sold; 
 
(b) 
over any quarter or month; or 
 
(c) 
over the fiscal year of the producer of the automotive material, 
 
provided that the good was produced during the fiscal year, quarter or 
month forming the basis for the calculation, in which: 
 
(i) 
the average in subparagraph (a) is calculated separately for 
those goods sold to one or more motor vehicle producers; 
or  
 
(ii) 
the average in subparagraph (a) or (b) is calculated 
separately for those goods that are exported to the territory 
of another Party.

that the good satisfies the requirements in Article 3.2 (Originating Goods) and all 
other applicable requirements in this Chapter. 
 
2. 
Each Party shall provide that an originating good or material of one or 
more of the Parties that is used in the production of another good in the territory 
of another Party is considered as originating in the territory of the other Party. 
 
3. 
Each Party shall provide that production undertaken on a non-originating 
material in the territory of one or more of the Parties by one or more producers 
may contribute toward the originating content of a good for the purpose of 
determining its origin, regardless of whether that production was sufficient to 
confer originating status to the material itself. 
 
 
 
3-12 
 
Article 3.11:  De Minimis 
 
1. 
Except as provided in Annex 3-C (Exceptions to Article 3.11 (De 
Minimis)), each Party shall provide that a good that contains non-originating 
materials that do not satisfy the applicable change in tariff classification 
requirement specified in Annex 3-D (Product-Specific Rules of Origin) for the 
good is nonetheless an originating good if the value of all those materials does not 
exceed 10 per cent of the value of the good, as defined under Article 3.1 
(Definitions), and the good meets all the other applicable requirements of this 
Chapter. 
 
2.  
Paragraph 1 applies only when using a non-originating material in the 
production of another good.

originating based on the: 
 
(a) 
physical segregation of each fungible good or material; or 
 
(b) 
use of any inventory management method recognised in the 
Generally Accepted Accounting Principles if the fungible good or 
material is commingled, provided that the inventory management 
method selected is used throughout the fiscal year of the person 
that selected the inventory management method. 
 
 
Article 3.13:  Accessories, Spare Parts, Tools and Instructional or Other 
Information Materials 
 
1. 
Each Party shall provide that:

parts, tools or instructional or other information materials, as 
described in paragraph 3, are to be disregarded; and   
 
3-13 
 
 
(b) 
in determining whether a good meets a regional value content 
requirement, the value of the accessories, spare parts, tools or 
instructional or other information materials, as described in 
paragraph 3, are to be taken into account as originating or non-
originating materials, as the case may be, in calculating the regional 
value content of the good. 
 
2. 
Each Party shall provide that a good’s accessories, spare parts, tools or 
instructional or other information materials, as described in paragraph 3, have the 
originating status of the good with which they are delivered.

that good. 
 
 
Article 3.14:  Packaging Materials and Containers for Retail Sale 
 
1. 
Each Party shall provide that packaging materials and containers in which 
a good is packaged for retail sale, if classified with the good, are disregarded in 
determining whether all the non-originating materials used in the production of 
the good have satisfied the applicable process or change in tariff classification 
requirement set out in Annex 3-D (Product-Specific Rules of Origin) or whether 
the good is wholly obtained or produced. 
 
2. 
Each Party shall provide that if a good is subject to a regional value 
content requirement, the value of the packaging materials and containers in which 
the good is packaged for retail sale, if classified with the good, are taken into 
account as originating or non-originating, as the case may be, in calculating the 
regional value content of the good. 
 
 
Article 3.15:  Packing Materials and Containers for Shipment 
 
Each Party shall provide that packing materials and containers for 
shipment are disregarded in determining whether a good is originating.

Harmonized System, the originating status of the set shall be determined in 
accordance with the product-specific rule of origin that applies to the set. 
 
2. 
Each Party shall provide that for a set classified as a result of the 
application of rule 3(c) of the General Rules for the Interpretation of the 
Harmonized System, the set is originating only if each good in the set is 
originating and both the set and the goods meet the other applicable requirements 
of this Chapter.

information by an importing Party under paragraph 1(a), the importer does not 
provide information to the importing Party or the information provided is not

verification. 
 
6. 
For a verification under paragraphs 1(a) through 1(c), the importing Party 
shall: 
 
(a) 
ensure that a written request for information, or for documentation 
to be reviewed during a verification visit, is limited to information 
and documentation to determine whether the good is originating; 
6  For greater certainty, a Party is not required to request information from the exporter or producer 
to support a claim for preferential tariff treatment or complete a verification through the exporter 
or producer if the claim for preferential tariff treatment is based on the importer’s certification of 
origin. 
 
3-21 
                                                           
 
 
(b) 
describe the information or documentation in sufficient detail to 
allow the importer, exporter or producer to identify the information 
and documentation necessary to respond; 
 
(c) 
allow the importer, exporter or producer at least 30 days from the 
date of receipt of the written request for information under 
paragraph 1(a) or 1(b) to respond;

possible and no later than 90 days after it receives the information 
necessary to make the determination, including, if applicable, any 
information received under paragraph 9, and no later than 365 days 
after the first request for information or other action under 
paragraph 1.  If permitted by its law, a Party may extend the 365 
day period in exceptional cases, such as where the technical 
information concerned is very complex. 
 
7. 
If an importing Party makes a verification request under paragraph 1(b), it 
shall, on request of the Party where the exporter or producer is located and in 
accordance with the importing Party’s laws and regulations, inform that Party.  
The Parties concerned shall decide the manner and timing of informing the Party 
where the exporter or producer is located of the verification request.  In addition, 
on request of the importing Party, the Party where the exporter or producer is 
located may, as it deems appropriate and in accordance with its laws and 
regulations, assist with the verification.  This assistance may include providing a 
contact point for the verification, collecting information from the exporter or 
producer on behalf of the importing Party, or other activities in order that the 
importing Party may make a determination as to whether the good is originating.  
The importing Party shall not deny a claim for preferential tariff treatment solely 
on the ground that the Party where the exporter or producer is located did not 
provide requested assistance. 
 
8. 
If an importing Party initiates a verification under paragraph 1(c), it shall, 
at the time of the request for the visit, inform the Party where the exporter or

the exporter or producer is located to accompany them during the visit. 
 
9. 
Prior to issuing a written determination, the importing Party shall inform 
the importer and any exporter or producer that provided information directly to

(a) 
provide the importer with a written determination of whether the 
good is originating that includes the basis for the determination; 
and  
 
(b) 
provide the importer, exporter or producer that provided 
information during the verification or certified that the good was 
originating with the results of the verification and the reasons for 
that result. 
 
11. 
During verification, the importing Party shall allow the release of the 
good, subject to payment of duties or provision of security as provided for in its 
law.  If as a result of the verification the importing Party determines that the good 
is an originating good, it shall grant preferential tariff treatment to the good and 
refund any excess duties paid or release any security provided, unless the security 
also covers other obligations. 
 
12. 
If verifications of identical goods by a Party indicate a pattern of conduct 
by an importer, exporter or producer of false or unsupported representations 
relevant to a claim that a good imported into its territory qualifies as an 
originating good, the Party may withhold preferential tariff treatment to identical 
goods imported, exported or produced by that person until that person 
demonstrates that the identical goods qualify as originating.  For the purposes of 
this paragraph, “identical goods” means goods that are the same in all respects 
relevant to the particular rule of origin that qualifies the goods as originating. 
 
13.   
For the purpose of a verification request, it is sufficient for a Party to rely 
on the contact information of an exporter, producer or importer in a Party 
provided in a certification of origin.

If an importing Party denies a claim for preferential tariff treatment, it 
shall issue a determination to the importer that includes the reasons for the 
determination. 
 
4.
