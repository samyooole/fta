Article 22.2:  Committee on Competitiveness and Business Facilitation 
 
1. 
The Parties recognise that, in order to enhance the domestic, regional and

and development within the free trade area, their business environments must be 
responsive to market developments.

and Business Facilitation (Committee), composed of government representatives 
of each Party.

integration and development within the free trade area; 
 
(b) 
explore ways to take advantage of the trade and investment 
opportunities that this Agreement creates; 
 
(c) 
provide advice and recommendations to the Commission on ways 
to further enhance the competitiveness of the Parties’ economies,

of this Agreement, and thereafter as necessary.   
 
 
5. 
In carrying out its functions, the Committee may work with other 
committees, working groups and any other subsidiary body established under this 
Agreement.  The Committee may also seek advice from, and consider the work of, 
appropriate experts, such as international donor institutions, enterprises and non-
governmental organisations. 
 
 
Article 22.3:  Supply Chains

workshops or other capacity building activities with appropriate experts, including 
private sector and international donor organisations, to assist participation by 
SMEs in supply chains in the free trade area.

The Committee shall, as appropriate, work with other committees, 
working groups and any other subsidiary body established under this Agreement, 
including through joint meetings, to identify and discuss measures affecting the

that it does not duplicate the activities of these other bodies.

relevant to the development and strengthening of supply chains between the 
Parties.
