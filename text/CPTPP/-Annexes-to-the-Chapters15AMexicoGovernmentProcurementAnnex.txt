(a) Notwithstanding any provision of Chapter 15 (Government Procurement), an entity may impose a local content requirement of no more than:  (i) 40 per cent, for labour-intensive turnkey or major integrated projects; or   (ii) 25 per cent, for capital-intensive turnkey or major integrated projects.  (b) For the purposes of this paragraph, “turnkey or major integrated project” means, in general, a construction, supply or installation project undertaken by a person pursuant to a right granted by an entity with respect to which:   (i) the prime contractor is vested with the authority to select the general contractors or subcontractors;   (ii) neither the Government of Mexico nor its entities fund the project;  (iii) the person bears the risks associated with non-performance; and  (iv) the facility will be operated by an entity or through a procurement contract of that entity.   14.  In the event that Mexico exceeds in any given year the total value of contracts it may set aside for that year in accordance with paragraph 10 of its Permanent Provisions or paragraphs 1, 2 and 4 of its Transitional Provisions, Mexico shall consult with the other Parties with a view to agreement on compensation in the form of additional procurement opportunities during the following year.  The consultations shall be without prejudice to the rights of any Party under Chapter 28 (Dispute Settlement).  15.  Nothing in Chapter 15 (Government Procurement) shall be construed to require PEMEX to enter into risk-sharing contracts.   16.  Chapter 15 (Government Procurement) shall not apply to contracts to be awarded to cooperatives and rural or urban unprivileged groups that the government branch or entity agreed directly with them in accordance with laws and regulations existing at the time of the entry into force of this Agreement for Mexico.  17.  For greater certainty, Chapter 15 (Government Procurement) shall be interpreted in accordance with the following:   ANNEX 15-A – MEXICO – 21    (a) where a contract to be awarded by a procuring entity is not covered by Chapter 15 (Government Procurement), Chapter 15 shall not be construed to cover any good or service component of that contract;   (b) any exclusion that is related either specifically or generally to a procuring entity shall also apply to any successor entity in such a manner as to maintain the value of this offer; and  (c) Chapter 15 (Government Procurement) shall not cover procurement by a procuring entity on behalf of another entity where the procurement would not be covered by Chapter 15 if it were conducted by the other entity itself.     ANNEX 15-A – MEXICO – 22      SECTION H: Thresholds Adjustment Formula   1.  Notwithstanding the threshold values set out in sections A and C, in order to provide equivalence to the current value of the thresholds applied in the context of the NAFTA, Mexico shall, from the date of entry into force of this Agreement for Mexico, apply the NAFTA thresholds, as may be amended, instead of those mentioned in Sections A and C.  2.  Mexico shall calculate and convert the value of the thresholds into Mexican pesos using the conversion rate of the Banco de México (Bank of Mexico). Its conversion rate shall be the existing value of the Mexican peso in terms of the U.S. dollar as of December 1 and June 1 of each year, or the first working day thereafter.  The conversion rate as of December 1 shall apply from January 1 to June 30 of the following year, and the conversion rate as of June 1 shall apply from July 1 to December 31 of that year.  3.  Information related with thresholds shall be published in www.compranet.gob.mx                ANNEX 15-A – MEXICO – 23      SECTION I: Procurement Information   Information on government procurement shall be published in the following websites:  www.dof.gob.mx   www.compranet.gog.mx   www.pemex.com   www.cfe.gob.mx                  ANNEX 15-A – MEXICO – 24      SECTION J: Transitional Measures    None.
