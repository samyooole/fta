ARTICLE 3: ADVANCE RULINGS  1. Each Member shall issue an advance ruling in a reasonable, time-bound manner to the applicant that has submitted a written request containing all necessary information. If a Member declines to issue an advance ruling, it shall promptly notify the applicant in writing, setting out the relevant facts and the basis for its decision.  2. A Member may decline to issue an advance ruling to the applicant where the question raised in the application:  (a) is already pending in the applicant's case before any governmental agency, appellate tribunal, or court; or  (b) has already been decided by any appellate tribunal or court. Chapter 6 - Customs and Trade Facilitation  6-6   3. The advance ruling shall be valid for a reasonable period of time after its issuance unless the law, facts, or circumstances supporting that ruling have changed.  4. Where the Member revokes, modifies, or invalidates the advance ruling, it shall provide written notice to the applicant setting out the relevant facts and the basis for its decision. Where a Member revokes, modifies, or invalidates advance rulings with retroactive effect, it may only do so where the ruling was based on incomplete, incorrect, false, or misleading information.  5. An advance ruling issued by a Member shall be binding on that Member in respect of the applicant that sought it. The Member may provide that the advance ruling is binding on the applicant.  6.  Each Member shall publish, at a minimum:  (a) the requirements for the application for an advance ruling, including the information to be provided and the format;  (b) the time period by which it will issue an advance ruling; and  (c) the length of time for which the advance ruling is valid.  7. Each Member shall provide, upon written request of an applicant, a review of the advance ruling or the decision to revoke, modify, or invalidate the advance ruling.2  8. Each Member shall endeavour to make publicly available any information on advance rulings which it considers to be of significant interest to other interested parties, taking into account the need to protect commercially confidential information.  9. Definitions and scope:  (a) An advance ruling is a written decision provided by a Member to the applicant prior to the importation of a good covered by the application that sets forth the treatment that the Member shall provide to the good at the time of importation with regard to:  (i)  the good's tariff classification; and  (ii)  the origin of the good.3                                                            2  Under this paragraph: (a) a review may, either before or after the ruling has been acted upon, be provided by the official, office, or authority that issued the ruling, a higher or independent administrative authority, or a judicial authority; and (b) a Member is not required to provide the applicant with recourse to paragraph 1 of Article 4. 3  It is understood that an advance ruling on the origin of a good may be an assessment of origin for the purposes of the Agreement on Rules of Origin where the ruling meets the requirements of this Agreement and the Agreement on Rules of Origin. Likewise, an assessment of origin under the Chapter 6 - Customs and Trade Facilitation  6-7  (b)  In addition to the advance rulings defined in subparagraph (a), Members are encouraged to provide advance rulings on:  (i)  the appropriate method or criteria, and the application thereof, to be used for determining the customs  value under a particular set of facts;  (ii)  the applicability of the Member's requirements for relief or exemption from customs duties;  (iii)  the application of the Member's requirements for quotas, including tariff quotas; and   (iv)  any additional matters for which a Member considers it appropriate to issue an advance ruling.  (c)   An applicant is an exporter, importer or any person with a justifiable cause or a representative thereof.  (d)  A Member may require that the applicant have legal representation or registration in its territory. To the extent possible, such requirements shall not restrict the categories of persons eligible to apply for advance rulings, with particular consideration for the specific needs of small and medium-sized enterprises. These requirements shall be clear and transparent and not constitute a  means of arbitrary or unjustifiable discrimination.  ARTICLE 4: PROCEDURES FOR APPEAL OR REVIEW  1. Each Member shall provide that any person to whom customs issues an administrative decision4 has the right, within its territory, to:  (a)  an administrative appeal to or review by an administrative authority higher than or independent of the official or office that issued the decision; and/or  (b)  a judicial appeal or review of the decision.                                                                                                                                                                                      Agreement on Rules of Origin may be an advance ruling on the origin of a good for the purposes of this Agreement where the ruling meets the requirements of both agreements. Members are not required to establish separate arrangements under this provision in addition to those established pursuant to the Agreement on Rules of Origin in relation to the assessment of origin provided that the requirements of this Article are fulfilled.  4  An administrative decision in this Article means a decision with a legal effect that affects the rights and obligations of a specific person in an individual case. It shall be understood that an administrative decision in this Article covers an administrative action within the meaning of Article X of the GATT 1994 or failure to take an administrative action or decision as provided for in a Member's domestic law and legal system. For addressing such failure, Members may maintain an alternative administrative mechanism or judicial recourse to direct the customs authority to promptly issue an administrative decision in place of the right to appeal or review under subparagraph 1(a).  Chapter 6 - Customs and Trade Facilitation  6-8   2. The legislation of a Member may require that an administrative appeal or review be initiated prior to a judicial appeal or review.  3. Each Member shall ensure that its procedures for appeal or review are carried out in a non-discriminatory manner.  4. Each Member shall ensure that, in a case where the decision on appeal or review under subparagraph 1(a) is not given either:   (a)  within set periods as specified in its laws or regulations; or  (b) without undue delay   the petitioner has the right to either further appeal to or further review by the administrative authority or the judicial authority or any other recourse to the judicial authority.5  5. Each Member shall ensure that the person referred to in paragraph 1 is provided with the reasons for the administrative decision so as to enable such a person to have recourse to procedures for appeal or review where necessary.  6. Each Member is encouraged to make the provisions of this Article applicable to an administrative decision issued by a relevant border agency other than customs.  ARTICLE 5: OTHER MEASURES TO ENHANCE IMPARTIALITY, NON-DISCRIMINATION AND TRANSPARENCY  1 Notifications for enhanced controls or inspections  Where a Member adopts or maintains a system of issuing notifications or guidance to its concerned authorities for enhancing the level of controls or inspections at the border in respect of foods, beverages, or feedstuffs covered under the notification or guidance for protecting human, animal, or plant life or health within its territory, the following disciplines shall apply to the manner of their issuance, termination, or suspension:  (a)  the Member may, as appropriate, issue the notification or guidance based on risk;  (b)  the Member may issue the notification or guidance so that it applies uniformly only to those points of entry where the sanitary and phytosanitary conditions on which the notification or guidance are based apply;  (c)  the Member shall promptly terminate or suspend the notification or guidance                                                            5  Nothing in this paragraph shall prevent a Member from recognizing administrative silence on appeal or review as a decision in favor of the petitioner in accordance with its laws and regulations.  Chapter 6 - Customs and Trade Facilitation  6-9  when circumstances giving rise to it no longer exist, or if changed circumstances can be addressed in a less trade-restrictive manner; and  (d)  when the Member decides to terminate or suspend the notification or guidance, it shall, as appropriate, promptly publish the announcement of its termination or suspension in a non-discriminatory and easily accessible manner, or inform the exporting Member or the importer.  2   Detention  A Member shall promptly inform the carrier or importer in case of detention of goods declared for importation, for inspection by customs or any other competent authority.  3  Test Procedures  3.1 A Member may, upon request, grant an opportunity for a second test in case the first test result of a sample taken upon arrival of goods declared for importation shows an adverse finding.  3.2 A Member shall either publish, in a non-discriminatory and easily accessible manner, the name and address of any laboratory where the test can be carried out or provide this information to the importer when it is granted the opportunity provided under paragraph 3.1.  3.3 A Member shall consider the result of the second test, if any, conducted under paragraph 3.1, for the release and clearance of goods and, if appropriate, may accept the results of such test.  ARTICLE 6: DISCIPLINES ON FEES AND CHARGES IMPOSED ON OR IN CONNECTION WITH IMPORTATION AND EXPORTATION AND PENALTIES  1   General Disciplines on Fees and Charges Imposed on or in Connection with Importation and Exportation  1.1 The provisions of paragraph 1 shall apply to all fees and charges other than import and export duties and other than taxes within the purview of Article III of GATT 1994 imposed by Members on or in connection with the importation or exportation of goods.  1.2 Information on fees and charges shall be published in accordance with Article 1. This information shall include the fees and charges that will be applied, the reason for such fees and charges, the responsible authority and when and how payment is to be made.  1.3 An adequate time period shall be accorded between the publication of new or amended fees and charges and their entry into force, except in urgent circumstances. Such fees and charges shall not be applied until information on them has been published. Chapter 6 - Customs and Trade Facilitation  6-10   1.4 Each Member shall periodically review its fees and charges with a view to reducing their number and diversity, where practicable.  2   Specific disciplines on Fees and Charges for Customs Processing Imposed on or in Connection with Importation and Exportation  Fees and charges for customs processing:  (i) shall be limited in amount to the approximate cost of the services rendered on or in connection with the specific import or export operation in question; and  (ii) are not required to be linked to a specific import or export operation provided they are levied for services that are closely connected to the customs processing of goods.  3 Penalty Disciplines  3.1  For the purpose of paragraph 3, the term "penalties" shall mean those imposed by a Member's customs administration for a breach of the Member's customs laws, regulations, or procedural requirements.   3.2 Each Member shall ensure that penalties for a breach of a customs law, regulation, or procedural requirement are imposed only on the person(s) responsible for the breach under its laws.  3.3 The penalty imposed shall depend on the facts and circumstances of the case and shall be commensurate with the degree and severity of the breach.  3.4 Each Member shall ensure that it maintains measures to avoid:  (a) conflicts of interest in the assessment and collection of penalties and duties; and  (b) creating an incentive for the assessment or collection of a penalty that is inconsistent with paragraph 3.3.  3.5 Each Member shall ensure that when a penalty is imposed for a breach of customs laws, regulations, or procedural requirements, an explanation in writing is provided to the person(s) upon whom the penalty is imposed specifying the nature of the breach and the applicable law, regulation or procedure under which the amount or range of penalty for the breach has been prescribed.  3.6 When a person voluntarily discloses to a Member's customs administration the circumstances of a breach of a customs law, regulation, or procedural requirement prior to the discovery of the breach by the customs administration, the Member is Chapter 6 - Customs and Trade Facilitation  6-11  encouraged to, where appropriate, consider this fact as a potential mitigating factor when establishing a penalty for that person.  3.7 The provisions of this paragraph shall apply to the penalties on traffic in transit referred to in paragraph 3.1.  ARTICLE 7: RELEASE AND CLEARANCE OF GOODS  1 Pre-arrival Processing  1.1 Each Member shall adopt or maintain procedures allowing for the submission of import documentation and other required information, including manifests, in order to begin processing prior to the arrival of goods with a view to expediting the release of goods upon arrival.  1.2 Each Member shall, as appropriate, provide for advance lodging of documents in electronic format for pre-arrival processing of such documents.    2 Electronic Payment  Each Member shall, to the extent practicable, adopt or maintain procedures allowing the option of electronic payment for duties, taxes, fees, and charges collected by customs incurred upon importation and exportation.   3 Separation of Release from Final Determination of Customs Duties, Taxes, Fees and Charges  3.1 Each Member shall adopt or maintain procedures allowing the release of goods prior to the final determination of customs duties, taxes, fees, and charges, if such a determination is not done prior to, or upon arrival, or as rapidly as possible after arrival and provided that all other regulatory requirements have been met.  3.2 As a condition for such release, a Member may require:  (a) payment of customs duties, taxes, fees, and charges determined prior to or upon arrival of goods and a guarantee for any amount not yet determined in the form of a surety, a deposit, or another appropriate instrument provided for in its laws and regulations; or  (b) a guarantee in the form of a surety, a deposit, or another appropriate instrument provided for in its laws and regulations.   3.3 Such guarantee shall not be greater than the amount the Member requires to ensure payment of customs duties, taxes, fees, and charges ultimately due for the goods covered by the guarantee.  Chapter 6 - Customs and Trade Facilitation  6-12  3.4 In cases where an offence requiring imposition of monetary penalties or fines has been detected, a guarantee may be required for the penalties and fines that may be imposed.  3.5 The guarantee as set out in paragraphs 3.2 and 3.4 shall be discharged when it is no longer required.  3.6 Nothing in these provisions shall affect the right of a Member to examine, detain, seize or confiscate or deal with the goods in any manner not otherwise inconsistent with the Member's WTO rights and obligations.  4   Risk Management  4.1 Each Member shall, to the extent possible, adopt or maintain a risk management system for customs control.  4.2 Each Member shall design and apply risk management in a manner as to avoid arbitrary or unjustifiable discrimination, or a disguised restriction on international trade.  4.3 Each Member shall concentrate customs control and, to the extent possible other relevant border controls, on high-risk consignments and expedite the release of low-risk consignments. A Member also may select, on a random basis, consignments for such controls as part of its risk management.  4.4 Each Member shall base risk management on an assessment of risk through appropriate selectivity criteria. Such selectivity criteria may include, inter alia, the Harmonized System code, nature and description of the goods, country of origin, country from which the goods were shipped, value of the goods, compliance record of traders, and type of means of transport.    5   Post-clearance Audit  5.1 With a view to expediting the release of goods, each Member shall adopt or maintain post-clearance audit to ensure compliance with customs and other related laws and regulations.  5.2  Each Member shall select a person or a consignment for post-clearance audit in a risk-based manner, which may include appropriate selectivity criteria. Each Member shall conduct post-clearance audits in a transparent manner. Where the person is involved in the audit process and conclusive results have been achieved the Member shall, without delay, notify the person whose record is audited of the results, the person's rights and obligations, and the reasons for the results.  5.3 The information obtained in post-clearance audit may be used in further administrative or judicial proceedings.  Chapter 6 - Customs and Trade Facilitation  6-13  5.4 Members shall, wherever practicable, use the result of post-clearance audit in applying risk management.  6   Establishment and Publication of Average Release Times  6.1 Members are encouraged to measure and publish their average release time of goods periodically and in a consistent manner, using tools such as, inter alia, the Time Release Study of the World Customs Organization (referred to in this Agreement as the “WCO”).6  6.2 Members are encouraged to share with the Committee their experiences in measuring average release times, including methodologies used, bottlenecks identified, and any resulting effects on efficiency.  7   Trade Facilitation Measures for Authorized Operators  7.1 Each Member shall provide additional trade facilitation measures related to import, export, or transit formalities and procedures, pursuant to paragraph 7.3, to operators who meet specified criteria, hereinafter called authorized operators. Alternatively, a Member may offer such trade facilitation measures through customs procedures generally available to all operators and is not required to establish a separate scheme.  7.2 The specified criteria to qualify as an authorized operator shall be related to compliance, or the risk of non-compliance, with requirements specified in a Member's laws, regulations or procedures.   (a)  Such criteria, which shall be published, may include:  (i)  an appropriate record of compliance with customs and other related laws and regulations;  (ii)  a system of managing records to allow for necessary internal controls;   (iii)  financial solvency, including, where appropriate, provision of a sufficient security or guarantee; and  (iv)  supply chain security.   (b)  Such criteria shall not:   (i)  be designed or applied so as to afford or create arbitrary or unjustifiable discrimination between operators where the same conditions prevail; and                                                             6  Each Member may determine the scope and methodology of such average release time measurement in accordance with its needs and capacity.  Chapter 6 - Customs and Trade Facilitation  6-14  (ii) to the extent possible, restrict the participation of small and medium-sized enterprises.  7.3  The trade facilitation measures provided pursuant to paragraph 7.1 shall include at least three of the following measures:7  (a)  low documentary and data requirements, as appropriate;  (b) low rate of physical inspections and examinations, as appropriate;  (c)  rapid release time, as appropriate;  (d)  deferred payment of duties, taxes, fees, and charges;  (e) use of comprehensive guarantees or reduced guarantees;  (f)  a single customs declaration for all imports or exports in a given period; and  (g)  clearance of goods at the premises of the authorized operator or another place authorized by customs.  7.4 Members are encouraged to develop authorized operator schemes on the basis of international standards, where such standards exist, except when such standards would be an inappropriate or ineffective means for the fulfilment of the legitimate objectives pursued.  7.5 In order to enhance the trade facilitation measures provided to operators, Members shall afford to other Members the possibility of negotiating mutual recognition of authorized operator schemes.  7.6 Members shall exchange relevant information within the Committee about authorized operator schemes in force.  8   Expedited Shipments  8.1 Each Member shall adopt or maintain procedures allowing for the expedited release of at least those goods entered through air cargo facilities to persons who apply for such treatment, while maintaining customs control.8 If a Member employs criteria9 limiting who may apply, the Member may, in published criteria, require that the applicant                                                            7  A measure listed in subparagraphs 7.3 (a) to (g) will be deemed to be provided to authorized operators if it is generally available to all operators.  8  In cases where a Member has an existing procedure that provides the treatment in paragraph 8.2, this provision does not require that Member to introduce separate expedited release procedures.  9  Such application criteria, if any, shall be in addition to the Member's requirements for operating with respect to all goods or shipments entered through air cargo facilities. Chapter 6 - Customs and Trade Facilitation  6-15  shall, as conditions for qualifying for the application of the treatment described in paragraph 8.2 to its expedited shipments:   (a)  provide adequate infrastructure and payment of customs expenses related to processing of expedited shipments in cases where the applicant fulfils the Member's requirements for such processing to be performed at a dedicated facility;  (b)  submit in advance of the arrival of an expedited shipment the information necessary for the release;  (c)  be assessed fees limited in amount to the approximate cost of services rendered in providing the treatment described in paragraph 8.2;  (d) maintain a high degree of control over expedited shipments through the use of internal security, logistics, and tracking technology from pick-up to delivery;  (e)  provide expedited shipment from pick-up to delivery;  (f) assume liability for payment of all customs duties, taxes, fees, and charges to the customs authority for the goods;  (g) have a good record of compliance with customs and other related laws and regulations;  (h)  comply with other conditions directly related to the effective enforcement of the Member's laws, regulations, and procedural requirements, that specifically relate to providing the treatment described in paragraph 8.2.  8.2 Subject to paragraphs 8.1 and 8.3, Members shall:   (a)  minimize the documentation required for the release of expedited shipments in accordance with paragraph 1 of Article 10 and, to the extent possible, provide for release based on a single submission of information on certain shipments;  (b)  provide for expedited shipments to be released under normal circumstances as rapidly as possible after arrival, provided the information required for release has been submitted;  (c) endeavour to apply the treatment in subparagraphs (a) and (b) to shipments of any weight or value recognizing that a Member is permitted to require additional entry procedures, including declarations and supporting documentation and payment of duties and taxes, and to limit such treatment based on the type of good, provided the treatment is not limited to low value goods such as documents; and  Chapter 6 - Customs and Trade Facilitation  6-16  (d)  provide, to the extent possible, for a de minimis shipment value or dutiable amount for which customs duties and taxes will not be collected, aside from certain prescribed  goods. Internal taxes, such as value added taxes and excise taxes, applied to imports  consistently with Article III of the GATT 1994 are not subject to this provision.  8.3 Nothing in paragraphs 8.1 and 8.2 shall affect the right of a Member to examine, detain, seize, confiscate or refuse entry of goods, or to carry out post-clearance audits, including in connection with the use of risk management systems. Further, nothing in paragraphs 8.1 and 8.2 shall prevent a Member from requiring, as a condition for release, the submission of additional information and the fulfilment of non-automatic licensing requirements.    9   Perishable Goods10  9.1 With a view to preventing avoidable loss or deterioration of perishable goods, and provided that all regulatory requirements have been met, each Member shall provide for the release of perishable goods:  (a) under normal circumstances within the shortest possible time; and  (b) in exceptional circumstances where it would be appropriate to do so, outside the business hours of customs and other relevant authorities.  9.2 Each Member shall give appropriate priority to perishable goods when scheduling any examinations that may be required.  9.3 Each Member shall either arrange or allow an importer to arrange for the proper storage of perishable goods pending their release. The Member may require that any storage facilities arranged by the importer have been approved or designated by its relevant authorities. The movement of the goods to those storage facilities, including authorizations for the operator moving the goods, may be subject to the approval, where required, of the relevant authorities. The Member shall, where practicable and consistent with domestic legislation, upon the request of the importer, provide for any procedures necessary for release to take place at those storage facilities.  9.4 In cases of significant delay in the release of perishable goods, and upon written request, the importing Member shall, to the extent practicable, provide a communication on the reasons for the delay.  ARTICLE 8: BORDER AGENCY COOPERATION  1.  Each Member shall ensure that its authorities and agencies responsible for border controls and procedures dealing with the importation, exportation, and transit of                                                            10  For the purposes of this provision, perishable goods are goods that rapidly decay due to their natural characteristics, in particular in the absence of appropriate storage conditions. Chapter 6 - Customs and Trade Facilitation  6-17  goods cooperate with one another and coordinate their activities in order to facilitate trade.  2.  Each Member shall, to the extent possible and practicable, cooperate on mutually agreed terms with other Members with whom it shares a common border with a view to coordinating procedures at border crossings to facilitate cross-border trade.

ARTICLE 10: FORMALITIES CONNECTED WITH IMPORTATION, EXPORTATION AND TRANSIT  1   Formalities and Documentation Requirements  1.1  With a view to minimizing the incidence and complexity of import, export, and transit formalities and to decreasing and simplifying import, export, and transit documentation requirements and taking into account the legitimate policy objectives and other factors such as changed circumstances, relevant new information, business practices, availability of techniques and technology, international best practices, and inputs from interested parties, each Member shall review such formalities and documentation requirements and, based on the results of the review, ensure, as appropriate, that such formalities and documentation requirements are:  (a)  adopted and/or applied with a view to a rapid release and clearance of goods, particularly perishable goods;  (b) adopted and/or applied in a manner that aims at reducing the time and cost of compliance for traders and operators;  (c)  the least trade restrictive measure chosen where two or more alternative Chapter 6 - Customs and Trade Facilitation  6-18  measures are reasonably available for fulfilling the policy objective or objectives in question; and   (d)  not maintained, including parts thereof, if no longer required.    1.2  The Committee shall develop procedures for the sharing by Members of relevant information and best practices, as appropriate.   2   Acceptance of Copies  2.1 Each Member shall, where appropriate, endeavour to accept paper or electronic copies of supporting documents required for import, export, or transit formalities.  2.2 Where a government agency of a Member already holds the original of such a document, any other agency of that Member shall accept a paper or electronic copy, where applicable, from the agency holding the original in lieu of the original document. 2.3 A Member shall not require an original or copy of export declarations submitted to the customs authorities of the exporting Member as a requirement for importation.11  3   Use of International Standards  3.1 Members are encouraged to use relevant international standards or parts thereof as a basis for their import, export, or transit formalities and procedures, except as otherwise provided for in this Agreement.   3.2 Members are encouraged to take part, within the limits of their resources, in the preparation and periodic review of relevant international standards by appropriate international organizations.  3.3 The Committee shall develop procedures for the sharing by Members of relevant information, and best practices, on the implementation of international standards, as appropriate.

After the examination by the participating authorities or agencies of the documentation and/or data, the results shall be notified to the applicants through the single window in a timely manner.                                                             11  Nothing in this paragraph precludes a Member from requiring documents such as certificates, permits or licenses as a requirement for the importation of controlled or regulated goods. Chapter 6 - Customs and Trade Facilitation  6-19  4.2 In cases where documentation and/or data requirements have already been received through the single window, the same documentation and/or data requirements shall not be requested by participating authorities or agencies except in urgent circumstances and other limited exceptions which are made public.  4.3 Members shall notify the Committee of the details of operation of the single window.  4.4 Members shall, to the extent possible and practicable, use information technology to support the single window.   5   Preshipment Inspection  5.1 Members shall not require the use of preshipment inspections in relation to tariff classification and customs valuation.  5.2 Without prejudice to the rights of Members to use other types of preshipment inspection not covered by paragraph 5.1, Members are encouraged not to introduce or apply new requirements regarding their use.12  6   Use of Customs Brokers  6.1 Without prejudice to the important policy concerns of some Members that currently maintain a special role for customs brokers, from the entry into force of this Agreement Members shall not introduce the mandatory use of customs brokers.  6.2 Each Member shall notify the Committee and publish its measures on the use of customs brokers.

Goods allowed for outward processing may be re-imported with total or partial exemption from import duties and taxes in accordance with the Member's laws and regulations.  (b)  For the purposes of this Article, the term "inward processing" means the customs procedure under which certain goods can be brought into a Member’s customs territory conditionally relieved, totally or partially, from payment of import duties and taxes, or eligible for duty drawback, on the basis that such goods are intended for manufacturing, processing, or repair and subsequent exportation.  Chapter 6 - Customs and Trade Facilitation  6-21   (c)   For the purposes of this Article, the term "outward processing" means the customs procedure under which goods which are in free circulation in a Member’s customs territory may be temporarily exported for manufacturing, processing, or repair abroad and then re-imported.  ARTICLE 11: FREEDOM OF TRANSIT  1.

Traffic in transit shall not be conditioned upon collection of any fees or charges imposed in respect of transit, except the charges for transportation or those commensurate with administrative expenses entailed by transit or with the cost of services rendered.  3. Members shall not seek, take, or maintain any voluntary restraints or any other similar measures on traffic in transit. This is without prejudice to existing and future national regulations, bilateral or multilateral arrangements related to regulating transport, consistent with WTO rules.  4. Each Member shall accord to products which will be in transit through the territory of any other Member treatment no less favourable than that which would be accorded to such products if they were being transported from their place of origin to their destination without going through the territory of such other Member.  5. Members are encouraged to make available, where practicable, physically separate infrastructure (such as lanes, berths and similar) for traffic in transit.  6.   Formalities, documentation requirements, and customs controls in connection with traffic in transit shall not be more burdensome than necessary to:  (a)  identify the goods; and  (b) ensure fulfilment of transit requirements.  7.  Once goods have been put under a transit procedure and have been authorized to proceed from the point of origination in a Member's territory, they will not be subject to any customs charges nor unnecessary delays or restrictions until they conclude their transit at the point of destination within the Member's territory. Chapter 6 - Customs and Trade Facilitation  6-22   8.  Members shall not apply technical regulations and conformity assessment procedures within the meaning of the Agreement on Technical Barriers to Trade to goods in transit.  9.  Members shall allow and provide for advance filing and processing of transit documentation and data prior to the arrival of goods.  10. Once traffic in transit has reached the customs office where it exits the territory of a Member, that office shall promptly terminate the transit operation if transit requirements have been met.    11.  Where a Member requires a guarantee in the form of a surety, deposit or other appropriate monetary or non-monetary 13  instrument for traffic in transit, such guarantee shall be limited to ensuring that requirements arising from such traffic in transit are fulfilled.  12. Once the Member has determined that its transit requirements have been satisfied, the guarantee shall be discharged without delay.  13. Each Member shall, in a manner consistent with its laws and regulations, allow comprehensive guarantees which include multiple transactions for same operators or renewal of guarantees without discharge for subsequent consignments.  14.  Each Member shall make publicly available the relevant information it uses to set the guarantee, including single transaction and, where applicable, multiple transaction guarantee.   15. Each Member may require the use of customs convoys or customs escorts for traffic in transit only in circumstances presenting high risks or when compliance with customs laws and regulations cannot be ensured through the use of guarantees. General rules applicable to customs convoys or customs escorts shall be published in accordance with Article 1.  16.  Members shall endeavour to cooperate and coordinate with one another with a view to enhancing freedom of transit. Such cooperation and coordination may include, but is not limited to, an understanding on:  (a)  charges;  (b)  formalities and legal requirements; and  (c)  the practical operation of transit regimes.                                                             13  Nothing in this provision shall preclude a Member from maintaining existing procedures whereby the means of transport can be used as a guarantee for traffic in transit.  Chapter 6 - Customs and Trade Facilitation  6-23  17.  Each Member shall endeavour to appoint a national transit coordinator to which all enquiries and proposals by other Members relating to the good functioning of transit operations can be addressed.  ARTICLE 12: CUSTOMS COOPERATION  1   Measures Promoting Compliance and Cooperation  1.1 Members agree on the importance of ensuring that traders are aware of their compliance obligations, encouraging voluntary compliance to allow importers to self-correct without penalty in appropriate circumstances, and applying compliance measures to initiate stronger measures for non-compliant traders.14  1.2 Members are encouraged to share information on best practices in managing customs compliance, including through the Committee.

Such information shall be subject to the level of protection and confidentiality specified by the Member conducting the verification. Chapter 6 - Customs and Trade Facilitation  6-25  5.2 A requesting Member may be unable under its domestic law and legal system to comply with any of the subparagraphs of paragraph 5.1.

If the requesting Member is not in a position to comply with this requirement, it should specify this to the requested Member.  7   Postponement or Refusal of a Request  7.1 A requested Member may postpone or refuse part or all of a request to provide information, and shall inform the requesting Member of the reasons for doing so, where:    (a) it would be contrary to the public interest as reflected in the domestic law and legal system of the requested Member;  Chapter 6 - Customs and Trade Facilitation  6-26  (b) its domestic law and legal system prevents the release of the information.

Execution of such a request shall be at the discretion of the requested Member.  9   Administrative Burden  9.1 The requesting Member shall take into account the associated resource and cost implications for the requested Member in responding to requests for information. The requesting Member shall consider the proportionality between its fiscal interest in pursuing its request and the efforts to be made by the requested Member in providing the information.   9.2 If a requested Member receives an unmanageable number of requests for information or a request for information of unmanageable scope from one or more requesting Member(s) and is unable to meet such requests within a reasonable time, it may request one or more of the requesting Member(s) to prioritize with a view to agreeing on a practical limit within its resource constraints. In the absence of a mutually-agreed approach, the execution of such requests shall be at the discretion of the requested Member based on the results of its own prioritization.  10   Limitations  A requested Member shall not be required to:   (a) modify the format of its import or export declarations or procedures; Chapter 6 - Customs and Trade Facilitation  6-27   (b) call for documents other than those submitted with the import or export declaration as specified in subparagraph 6.1(c);  (c) initiate enquiries to obtain the information;  (d) modify the period of retention of such information;  (e) introduce paper documentation where electronic format has already been introduced;  (f) translate the information;  (g)  verify the accuracy of the information; or   (h) provide information that would prejudice the legitimate commercial interests of particular enterprises, public or private.  11   Unauthorized Use or Disclosure  11.1 In the event of any breach of the conditions of use or disclosure of information exchanged under this Article, the requesting Member that received the information shall promptly communicate the details of such unauthorized use or disclosure to the requested Member that provided the information and:  (a) take necessary measures to remedy the breach;  (b) take necessary measures to prevent any future breach; and  (c)  notify the requested Member of the measures taken under subparagraphs (a) and (b).  11.2 The requested Member may suspend its obligations to the requesting Member under this Article until the measures set out in paragraph 11.1 have been taken.  12  Bilateral and Regional Agreements  12.1 Nothing in this Article shall prevent a Member from entering into or maintaining a bilateral, plurilateral, or regional agreement for sharing or exchange of customs information and data, including on a secure and rapid basis such as on an automatic basis or in advance of the arrival of the consignment.  12.2 Nothing in this Article shall be construed as altering or affecting a Member’s rights or obligations under such bilateral, plurilateral, or regional agreements, or as governing the exchange of customs information and data under such other agreements.
