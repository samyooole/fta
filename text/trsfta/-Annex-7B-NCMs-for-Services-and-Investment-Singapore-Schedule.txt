ANNEX 7-B  
NON-CONFORMING MEASURES  
SCHEDULE OF SINGAPORE 
 Explanatory Note 
 
1.  The Schedule of Singapore to this Annex sets out, pursuant to Articles 7.6 (Non-
Conforming Measures) of Chapter 7 (Cross Border Trade in Services) and Article 
12.9 (Non-Conforming Measures) of Chapter 12 (Investment), the reservations taken 
by Singapore for sectors, sub-sectors or activities for which it may maintain existing, 
or adopt new or more restrictive, measures that do not conform with obligations 
imposed by:  
 
a)  Article  7.3  (National  Treatment)  of  Chapter  7  (Cross  Border  Trade  in 
Services) or Article 12.4 (National Treatment) of Chapter 12 (Investment);  
 
b)  Article 7.4 (Market Access) of Chapter 7 (Cross Border Trade in Services);  
 
c)  Article 12.5 (Most-Favoured-Nation Treatment) of Chapter 12 (Investment);  
 
d)  Article 7.5 (Local Presence) of Chapter 7 (Cross Border Trade in Services);  
 
e)  Article 12.7 (Performance Requirements) of Chapter 12 (Investment); or  
 
f)  Article  12.8  (Senior  Management  and  Board  of  Directors)  of  Chapter  12 
(Investment).  
 
2.  The sectors, subsectors or activities to which a reservation applies shall be stated in 
the Description of Reservation element. In the interpretation of a reservation, all 
elements of the reservation shall be considered in their totality. 
 
3.  A  National  Treatment  reservation  includes  a  reservation  in  respect  of  National 
Treatment  under  Chapter  7  (Cross  Border  Trade  in  Services)  and  Chapter  12 
(Investment) unless the context or circumstances require otherwise. 
 
4.  With  respect  to  cross-border  supply  of  service,  Local  Presence  and  National 
Treatment are separate disciplines and a measure that is only inconsistent with Local 
Presence need not be reserved against National Treatment. 
 
5.  The reservations and commitments relating to cross border trade in services shall be 
read  together  with  the  relevant  guidelines,  stated  in  GATT  documents 
MTN.GNS/W/164 dated 3 September 1993 and MTN.GNS/W/164 Add. 1 dated 30 
November 1993.
