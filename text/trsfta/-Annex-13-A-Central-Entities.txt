in particular in that the risks generally borne by the public sector (such as operative or 
financial risk) are partially or fully transferred to the supplier.

consideration for a supplier's execution of a contractual arrangement, a 
procuring entity grants to the supplier, for a specified period of time, 
temporary ownership or a right to control and operate, and demand payment 
for, the use of such works for the duration of the contract;  
 
(b)  
Build-rent-own-transfer/ build-lease-operate contracts: where a private

asset, possibly expands or restores it, and operates it.
