(b) A Party which introduces a new domestic technical regulation as referred to in subparagraph (a) shall, upon request from the other Party, identify the parts of the domestic technical regulation which substantially deviate from the relevant UN ECE Regulations or GTR and provide due justification as to the reasons for the deviation.  2. Insofar as a Party has introduced and maintains, in accordance with paragraph 1, domestic technical regulations that diverge from existing UN ECE Regulations or GTR, that Party shall review these domestic technical regulations at regular intervals, not exceeding five years, with a view to increasing their convergence to the relevant UN ECE Regulations or GTR.
