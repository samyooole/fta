SECTION 2  DEFINITION OF THE CONCEPT OF “ORIGINATING PRODUCTS”  Article 2  Originating Products  For the purposes of this Agreement, the following products shall be considered as originating in a Party:   (a) products wholly obtained in a Party within the meaning of Article 4; and   (b) products obtained in a Party incorporating materials which have not been wholly obtained there, provided that such materials have undergone sufficient working or processing in the Party concerned within the meaning of Article 5.   Article 3 Cumulation of Origin  1.  Notwithstanding Article 2 (Originating Products), products shall be considered as originating in a Party if such products are obtained there by incorporating materials originating in the other Party, provided that the working or processing carried out goes beyond the operations referred to in Article 6 (Insufficient Working or Processing). It shall not be necessary that the materials of the other Party have undergone sufficient working or processing.   2.  Notwithstanding paragraph 1, materials falling under HS Chapters 25 to 97 originating in the European Union shall be considered as materials originating in Turkey or Singapore when further processed or incorporated into a product obtained in Singapore or Turkey, as the case may be.     5    3.

Materials falling under HS Chapters 25 to 97 originating in an ASEAN country which is applying with Turkey a preferential agreement in accordance with Article XXIV of the GATT 1994, shall be considered as materials originating in a Party when incorporated in a product obtained in that Party provided that they have undergone working or processing in that Party which goes beyond the operations referred to in Article 6 (Insufficient Working or Processing).   6.  For the purposes of paragraph 5, the origin of the materials shall be determined according to the rules of origin applicable in the framework of Turkey’s preferential agreements with those countries.   7.  For the purposes of paragraph 5, the originating status of materials exported from one of the ASEAN countries to a Party to be used in further working or processing shall be established by a proof of origin under which these materials could be exported directly to Turkey.   8.  The cumulation provided for in paragraphs 5 to 10 may only be applied provided that:   (a)  the ASEAN countries involved in the acquisition of the originating status have undertaken to:   (i)  comply or ensure compliance with this Protocol; and      6  (ii) provide the administrative cooperation necessary to ensure the correct implementation of this Protocol both with regard to Turkey and among themselves;   (b) the undertakings referred to in subparagraph (a) have been notified to the Turkey.   9.

The materials listed in Annex C to this Protocol shall be excluded from the cumulation provided for in paragraphs 5 to 9 where at the time of importation of the product:   (a)  the tariff preference applicable to the materials in a Party is not the same for all the countries involved in the cumulation; and   (b)  the materials concerned would benefit, through cumulation, from a tariff treatment more favourable than the one they would benefit from if directly exported to a Party.   11.  At the request of a Party, the Parties may, by decision in the Joint Committee, modify Annex C to this Protocol. Any request for such a modification shall be communicated to the other Party at least two months before the meeting of that Committee.   12.  Materials originating in an ASEAN country shall be considered as materials originating in a Party when further processed or incorporated into one of the products listed in Annex D to this Protocol obtained there, provided that they have undergone working or processing in that Party which goes beyond the operations referred to in Article 6 (Insufficient Working or Processing).   13.  For the purposes of paragraph 12, the origin of the materials shall be determined according to the preferential rules of origin applicable to General System of Preferences (hereinafter referred to as “GSP”) beneficiary countries which are laid down in the related Ministerial Decree of Turkey.  14. For the purposes of paragraph 12, the originating status of materials exported from one of the ASEAN countries to a Party to be used in further working or processing shall be established by a proof of origin in accordance with the preferential rules applicable to GSP beneficiary countries as laid down in the related Ministerial Decree of Turkey.   15.  The cumulation provided for in paragraphs 12 to 15 may only be applied provided that:      7   (a) the ASEAN countries involved in the acquisition of the originating status have undertaken to:    (i) comply or ensure compliance with this Protocol; and   (ii) provide the administrative cooperation necessary to ensure the correct implementation of this Protocol both with regard to Turkey and between themselves;    (b) the undertakings referred to in subparagraph (a) have been notified to the  Turkey.   16.

Article 5 Sufficiently Worked or Processed Products  1.  For the purposes of subparagraph (b) of Article 2 (Originating Products), products which are not wholly obtained are considered to be sufficiently worked or processed when the conditions set out in the list in Annex B or B(a) to this Protocol are fulfilled.      9  2.  The conditions referred to above indicate, for all products covered by this Agreement, the working or processing which must be carried out on non-originating materials used in manufacturing and apply only in relation to such materials. It follows that if a product which has acquired originating status by fulfilling the conditions set out in the list in Annex B or B(a) to this Protocol is used in the manufacture of another product, the conditions applicable to the product in which it is incorporated do not apply to it, and no account shall be taken of the non-originating materials which may have been used in its manufacture.   3. By way of derogation from paragraph 1 and subject to paragraphs 4 and 5, non-originating materials which, according to the conditions set out in the list in Annex B or B(a) to this Protocol, are not to be used in the manufacture of a given product may nevertheless be used, provided that their total value or net weight assessed for the product does not exceed:   (a) ten percent of the weight of the product for products falling within Chapters 2 and 4 to 24 of the Harmonized System, other than processed fishery products of Chapter 16;   (b) ten percent of the ex-works price of the product for other products, except for products falling within Chapters 50 to 63 of the Harmonized System, for which the tolerances mentioned in Notes 6 and 7 of Annex A to this Protocol, shall apply.   4.  Paragraph 3 shall not allow to exceed any of the percentages for the maximum content of non-originating materials as specified in the list in Annex B to this Protocol.   5.  Paragraphs 3 and 4 shall not apply to products wholly obtained in a Party within the meaning of Article 4 (Wholly Obtained Products). However, without prejudice to Article 6 (Insufficient Working or Processing) and paragraph 2 of Article 7 (Unit of Qualification) the tolerance provided for in those paragraphs shall nevertheless apply to the sum of all the materials which are used in the manufacture of a product and for which the rule laid down in the list in Annex B to this Protocol for that product requires that such materials be wholly obtained.   Article 6 Insufficient Working or Processing  1.  Without prejudice to paragraph 2, the following operations shall be considered as insufficient working or processing to confer the status of originating products, whether or not the requirements of Article 5 (Sufficiently Worked or Processed Products) are satisfied:   (a)  preserving operations to ensure that the products remain in good condition during transport and storage;   (b)  breaking-up and assembly of packages;      10   (c)  washing, cleaning; removal of dust, oxide, oil, paint or other coverings;   (d)  ironing or pressing of textiles and textile articles;   (e) simple painting and polishing operations;   (f)  husking and partial or total milling of rice; polishing and glazing of cereals and rice;   (g)  operations to colour or flavour sugar or form sugar lumps; partial or total milling of crystal sugar;   (h)  peeling, stoning and shelling, of fruits, nuts and vegetables;   (i)  sharpening, simple grinding or simple cutting;   (j)  sifting, screening, sorting, classifying, grading, matching (including the making-up of sets of articles);   (k)  simple placing in bottles, cans, flasks, bags, cases, boxes, fixing on cards or boards and all other simple packaging operations;   (l)  affixing or printing marks, labels, logos and other like distinguishing signs on products or their packaging;   (m) simple mixing of products, whether or not of different kinds; mixing of sugar with any material;   (n) simple addition of water or dilution or dehydration or denaturation of products;   (o) simple assembly of parts of articles to constitute a complete article or disassembly of products into parts;   (p)  a combination of two or more of the operations specified in subparagraphs (a) to (o); or   (q)  slaughter of animals.   2.  For the purpose of paragraph 1, operations shall be considered simple when neither special skills nor machines, apparatus or tools especially produced or installed for those operations are required for their performance.   3.  All operations carried out either in Turkey or in Singapore on a given product shall be considered together when determining whether the working or processing undergone by that product is to be regarded as insufficient within the meaning of paragraph 1.       11  Article 7 Unit of Qualification  1.  The unit of qualification for the application of the provisions of this Protocol shall be the product which is considered as the basic unit when determining classification using the nomenclature of the Harmonized System.   2.  When a consignment consists of a number of identical products classified under the same heading of the Harmonized System, each individual item shall be taken into account when applying the provisions of this Protocol.    Where, under General Interpretative Rule 5 of the Harmonized System, packaging is included with the product for classification purposes, it shall be included for the purposes of determining origin.   Article 8 Accessories, Spare Parts and Tools  Accessories, spare parts and tools dispatched with a piece of equipment, machine, apparatus or vehicle, which are part of the normal equipment and included in the price thereof or which are not separately invoiced, shall be regarded as one with the piece of equipment, machine, apparatus or vehicle in question.  Article 9 Sets  Sets, as defined in General Interpretative Rule 3 of the Harmonized System, shall be regarded as originating when all component products are originating products. When a set is composed of originating and non-originating products, the set as a whole shall be regarded as originating, provided that the value of the non-originating products does not exceed fifteen percent of the ex-works price of the set.   Article 10 Neutral Elements  In order to determine whether a product originates, it shall not be necessary to determine the origin of the following which might be used in its manufacture:   (a)  energy and fuel;    (b)  plant and equipment, including goods to be used for their maintenance;        12  (c)  machines and tools and dies and moulds; spare parts and materials used in the maintenance of equipment and buildings; lubricants, greases, compounding materials and other materials used in production or used to operate equipment and buildings; gloves, glasses, footwear, clothing, safety equipment and supplies; equipment, devices and supplies used for testing or inspecting the good; catalyst and solvent; and   (d)  other goods which do not enter and which are not intended to enter into the final composition of the product.   Article 11 Accounting Segregation  1.  If originating and non-originating fungible materials are used in the working or processing of a product, the competent governmental authorities may, at the written request of economic operators, authorise the management of materials using the accounting segregation method without keeping the materials in separate stocks.   2.  The competent governmental authorities may make the granting of authorisation referred to in paragraph 1 subject to any conditions they deem appropriate.   3.  The authorisation shall be granted only if by use of the accounting segregation method it can be ensured that, at any time, the number of products obtained which could be considered as originating in Turkey or in Singapore is the same as the number that would have been obtained by using a method of physical segregation of the stocks.  4.  If authorised, the method such as averaging, last-in, first-out, or first-in, first-out, shall be applied and the application thereof shall be recorded on the basis of the general accounting principles applicable in Turkey or in Singapore, depending on where the product is manufactured.   5.  A manufacturer using the accounting segregation method shall make out or apply for origin declarations for the quantity of products which may be considered as originating in the exporting Party. At the request of the customs authorities or competent governmental authorities of the exporting Party, the beneficiary shall provide a statement of how the quantities have been managed.   6.  The competent governmental authorities shall monitor the use made of the authorisation referred to in paragraph 3 and may withdraw it if the manufacturer makes improper use of it or fails to fulfil any of the other conditions laid down in this Protocol.       13  SECTION 3  TERRITORIAL REQUIREMENTS  Article 12 Principle of Territoriality  1.  The conditions set out in Section 2 (Definition of the Concept of “Originating Products”) relating to the acquisition of originating status must be fulfilled without interruption in a Party.   2.  If originating goods exported from a Party to a non-Party return, they must be considered as non-originating, unless it can be demonstrated to the satisfaction of the customs authorities that:   (a) the returning goods are the same as those exported; and   (b)  they have not undergone any operation beyond that necessary to preserve them in good condition while in that non-Party or while being exported.   Article 13 Non Alteration  1.  The products declared for importation in a Party shall be the same products as exported from the other Party in which they are considered to originate. They shall not have been altered, transformed in any way or subjected to operations other than operations to preserve them in good condition or other than adding or affixing marks, labels, seals or any other documentation to ensure compliance with specific domestic requirements of the importing Party, prior to being declared for import.   2. Storage of products or consignments may take place provided they remain under customs supervision in the country(ies) of transit.   3.  Without prejudice to Section 4 (Origin Declaration), the splitting of consignments may take place where carried out by the exporter or under his responsibility provided they remain under customs supervision in the country(ies) of transit.   4.  Compliance with paragraphs 1 to 3 shall be considered as satisfied unless the customs authorities have reason to believe the contrary; in such cases, the customs authorities may request the declarant to provide evidence of compliance, which may be given by any means, including contractual transport documents such as bills of lading or factual or concrete evidence based on marking or numbering of packages or any evidence related to the goods themselves.   Article 14 Exhibitions      14  1.

The name and address of the exhibition must be indicated thereon. Where necessary, additional documentary evidence of the conditions under which they have been exhibited may be required.   3. Paragraph 1 shall apply to any trade, industrial, agricultural or crafts exhibition, fair or similar public show or display which is not organised for private purposes in shops or business premises with a view to the sale of foreign products, and during which the products remain under customs control.

Origin declarations which are submitted to the customs authorities of the importing Party after the final date for presentation specified in paragraph 1 may be accepted for the purposes of applying preferential treatment, where the failure to submit these documents by the final date set is due to exceptional circumstances.  3.  In cases of belated presentation other than those of paragraph 2, the customs authorities of the importing Party may accept the origin declarations where the products have been submitted before the said final date.  Article 18 Submission of Origin Declaration  For the purposes of claiming preferential tariff treatment, origin declarations shall be submitted to the customs authorities of the importing Party in accordance with the procedures applicable in that Party.

Article 23 Discrepancies and Formal Errors  1.  The discovery of slight discrepancies between the statements made in the origin declaration and those made in the documents submitted to the customs office for the purposes of carrying out the formalities for importing the products shall not ipso facto render the origin declaration null and void if it is duly established that this document does correspond to the products submitted.   2.  Obvious formal errors such as typing errors on a origin declaration should not cause the document to be rejected if these errors are not such as to create doubts concerning the correctness of the statements made in the document.     18   Article 24 Amounts Expressed in Euro  For the application of the provisions of paragraph 3 of Article 20 (Exemptions from Origin Declaration) in cases where products are invoiced in a currency other than Euro, amounts in the national currencies of the Parties equivalent to the amounts expressed in Euro shall be determined in accordance with the current exchange rate applicable in the importing party   SECTION 5  ARRANGEMENTS FOR ADMINISTRATIVE COOPERATION  Article 25 Cooperation between Competent Authorities  1.

Article 26 Verification of Origin Declarations  1.  Subsequent verifications of origin declarations shall be carried out at random or whenever the customs authorities of the importing Party have reasonable doubts as to the authenticity of such documents, the originating status of the products concerned or the fulfilment of the other requirements of this Protocol.   2.  For the purposes of implementing the provisions of paragraph 1, the customs authorities of the importing Party shall return, if it has been submitted, the origin declaration, or a copy of that document, to the customs authorities of the exporting Party giving, where appropriate, the reasons for the enquiry. Any document and information obtained suggesting that the information given on the origin declarations is incorrect shall be forwarded in support of the request for verification.   3.  The verification shall be carried out by the customs authorities of the exporting Party. For this purpose, they shall have the right to call for any evidence and to carry out any inspection of the exporter's accounts or any other check considered appropriate.       19  4.  If the customs authorities of the importing Party decide to suspend the granting of preferential treatment to the products concerned while awaiting the results of the verification, release of the products shall be offered to the importer subject to any precautionary measures judged necessary. Any suspension of preferential treatment shall be reinstated as soon as possible after the originating status of the products concerned or the fulfilment of the other requirements of this Protocol has been ascertained by the customs authorities of the importing Party.   5.  The customs authorities requesting the verification shall be informed of the results of this verification as soon as possible. These results must indicate clearly whether the documents are authentic and whether the products concerned can be considered as products originating in the Parties and fulfil the other requirements of this Protocol.   6.  If in cases of reasonable doubt there is no reply within 10 months of the date of the verification request or if the reply does not contain sufficient information to determine the authenticity of the document in question or the real origin of the products, the requesting customs authorities shall, except in exceptional circumstances, refuse entitlement to the preferences.

Where disputes arise in relation to the verification procedures of Article 26 (Verification of Origin Declarations) which cannot be settled between the competent authorities requesting a verification and the competent authorities responsible for carrying out this verification, or where they raise a question as to the interpretation of this Protocol, they shall be submitted to the Joint Committee.  2.  All disputes between the importer and the competent authorities of the importing Party shall be settled under the legislation of that Party.   Article 29 Penalties  Penalties shall be imposed in accordance with the relevant domestic legislation of the Parties on any person who draws up, or causes to be drawn up, a document which contains incorrect information for the purpose of obtaining preferential treatment for products.         20   SECTION 6  FINAL PROVISIONS  Article 30 Confidentiality  Each Party shall treat as confidential the information submitted in accordance with this Protocol by a person or authority of the other Party when such information is designated by that Party as confidential. Access to the said information may be refused where disclosure would undermine the protection of the commercial interest of the person that submitted the information.   Article 31 Amendments or modifications to this Protocol  1. The Parties may amend the provisions of this Protocol in accordance with Article 18.10 (Amendments) of Chapter 18 (Institutional, General and Final Provisions).   2. Following the conclusion of a free trade agreement between Turkey and one or several ASEAN countries, the Parties may, by decision in the Joint Committee, modify or adapt this Protocol and in particular Annex C referred to in paragraph 10 of Article 3 (Cumulation of Origin) to ensure coherence between the rules of origin applicable within the context of the preferential exchanges between ASEAN countries and Turkey.   Article 32 Transitional Provisions for Goods in Transit or Storage  This Agreement may be applied to goods which comply with the provisions of this Protocol and which on the date of entry into force of this Agreement are either in transit, in the Parties in temporary storage, in customs warehouses or in free zones, subject to the submission to the customs authorities of the importing Party, no later than one year after the import of the goods into the customs territory of that Party, of an origin declaration made out retrospectively in accordance with paragraph 6 of Article 16 (Conditions for Making Out an Origin Declaration), and if requested together with the documents showing that the goods have been transported directly in accordance with Article 13 (Non Alteration).   Article 33 Review and Appeal  The importing Party shall grant the right of appeal in matters relating to the eligibility for preferential tariff treatment to importers of goods traded or to be traded between the Parties, in accordance with its domestic laws, regulations and administrative practices.     21  ANNEX A  INTRODUCTORY NOTES TO THE LIST IN ANNEX B   Note 1 – General introduction  The list sets out the conditions required for all products to be considered as sufficiently worked or processed within the meaning of Article 5 (Sufficiently Worked or Processed Products) of the Protocol. There are four different types of rules, which vary according to the product:  (a) through working or processing a maximum content of non-originating materials is not exceeded;  (b) through working or processing the 4-digit Harmonized System heading or 6-digit Harmonized System sub-heading of the manufactured products becomes different from the 4-digit Harmonized System heading or 6-digit sub-heading respectively of the materials used;  (c) a specific working and processing operation is carried out; and  (d) working or processing is carried out on certain wholly obtained materials.   Note 2 – The structure of the list  2.1. The first two columns in the list describe the product obtained. The first column gives the heading number or chapter number used in the Harmonized System and the second column gives the description of goods used in that system for that heading or chapter. For each entry in the first two columns, a rule is specified in column 3. Where, in some cases, the entry in the first column is preceded by an “ex”, this signifies that the rules in column 3 apply only to the part of that heading as described in column 2.  2.2. Where several heading numbers are grouped together in column 1 or a chapter number is given and the description of products in column 2 is therefore given in general terms, the adjacent rules in column 3 apply to all products which, under the Harmonized System, are classified in headings of the chapter or in any of the headings grouped together in column 1.  2.3. Where there are different rules in the list applying to different products within a heading, each indent contains the description of that part of the heading covered by the adjacent rules in column 3.  2.4. Where two alternative rules are set out in column 3, separated by “or”, it is at the choice of the exporter which one to use.     22   Note 3 – Examples of how to apply the rules 3.1. Article 5 (Sufficiently Worked or Processed Products) of the Protocol, concerning products having acquired originating status which are used in the manufacture of other products, shall apply, regardless of whether this status has been acquired inside the factory where these products are used or in another factory in a Party.  3.2. Pursuant to Article 6 (Insufficient Working or Processing) of the Protocol, the working or processing carried out must go beyond the list of operations mentioned in that Article. If it does not, the goods shall not qualify for the granting of the benefit of preferential tariff treatment, even if the conditions set out in the list below are met.    Subject to the provision referred to in the first sub-paragraph, the rules in the list represent the minimum amount of working or processing required, and the carrying-out of more working or processing also confers originating status; conversely, the carrying-out of less working or processing cannot confer originating status.    Thus, if a rule provides that non-originating material, at a certain level of manufacture, may be used, the use of such material at an earlier stage of manufacture is allowed, and the use of such material at a later stage is not.   If a rule provides that non-originating material, at a certain level of manufacture, may not be used, the use of materials at an earlier stage of manufacture is allowed, and the use of materials at a later stage is not.   Example: when the list-rule for Chapter 19 requires that “non-originating materials of headings 1101 to 1108 cannot exceed 20% weight”, the use (i.e. importation) of cereals of Chapter 10 (materials at an earlier stage of manufacture) is not limited.  3.3. Without prejudice to Note 3.2, where a rule uses the expression “Manufacture from materials of any heading”, then materials of any heading(s) (even materials of the same description and heading as the product) may be used, subject, however, to any specific limitations which may also be contained in the rule.   However, the expression “Manufacture from materials of any heading, including other materials of heading ...” or “Manufacture from materials of any heading, including other materials of the same heading as the product” means that materials of any heading(s) may be used, except those of the same description as the product as given in column 2 of the list.  3.4. When a rule in the list specifies that a product may be manufactured from more than one material, this means that one or more materials may be used. It does not require that all be used.  3.5. Where a rule in the list specifies that a product must be manufactured from a particular material, the rule does not prevent the use of other materials which, because of their inherent nature, cannot satisfy this condition.     23   3.6. Where, in a rule in the list, two percentages are given for the maximum value of non-originating materials that can be used, then these percentages may not be added together. In other words, the maximum value of all the non-originating materials used may never exceed the higher of the percentages given. Furthermore, the individual percentages must not be exceeded, in relation to the particular materials to which they apply.  Note 4 – General provisions concerning certain agricultural goods  4.1. Agricultural goods falling within Chapters 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 12 and heading 2401 which are grown or harvested in the territory of a beneficiary country shall be treated as originating in the territory of that country, even if grown from seeds, bulbs, rootstock, cuttings, grafts, shoots, buds, or other live parts of plants imported from another country.  4.2. In cases where the content of non-originating sugar in a given product is subject to limitations, the weight of sugars of headings 1701 (sucrose) and 1702 (e.g., fructose, glucose, lactose, maltose, isoglucose or invert sugar) used in the manufacture of the final product and used in the manufacture of the non-originating products incorporated in the final product is taken into account for the calculation of such limitations.   Note 5 - Terminology used in respect of certain textile products  5.1. The term “natural fibres” is used in the list to refer to fibres other than artificial or synthetic fibres. It is restricted to the stages before spinning takes place, including waste, and, unless otherwise specified, includes fibres which have been carded, combed or otherwise processed, but not spun.  5.2. The term “natural fibres” includes horsehair of heading 0511, silk of headings 5002 and 5003, as well as wool-fibres and fine or coarse animal hair of headings 5101 to 5105, cotton fibres of headings 5201 to 5203, and other vegetable fibres of headings 5301 to 5305.  5.3. The terms “textile pulp”, “chemical materials” and “paper-making materials” are used in the list to describe the materials, not classified in Chapters 50 to 63, which can be used to manufacture artificial, synthetic or paper fibres or yarns.  5.4. The term “man-made staple fibres” is used in the list to refer to synthetic or artificial filament tow, staple fibres or waste, of headings 5501 to 5507.  Note 6 - Tolerances applicable to products made of a mixture of textile materials  6.1. Where, for a given product in the list, reference is made to this Note, the conditions set out in column 3 shall not be applied to any basic textile materials used in the     24  manufacture of this product and which, taken together, represent 10 % or less of the total weight of all the basic textile materials used. (See also Notes 6.3 and 6.4).  6.2. However, the tolerance mentioned in Note 6.1 may be applied only to mixed products which have been made from two or more basic textile materials.   The following are the basic textile materials:  - silk; - wool; - coarse animal hair; - fine animal hair; - horsehair; - cotton; - paper-making materials and paper; - flax; - true hemp; - jute and other textile bast fibres; - sisal and other textile fibres of the genus Agave; - coconut, abaca, ramie and other vegetable textile fibres; - synthetic man-made filaments; - artificial man-made filaments; - current-conducting filaments; - synthetic man-made staple fibres of polypropylene; - synthetic man-made staple fibres of polyester; - synthetic man-made staple fibres of polyamide; - synthetic man-made staple fibres of polyacrylonitrile; - synthetic man-made staple fibres of polyimide; - synthetic man-made staple fibres of polytetrafluoroethylene; - synthetic man-made staple fibres of poly(phenylene sulphide); - synthetic man-made staple fibres of poly(vinyl chloride); - other synthetic man-made staple fibres; - artificial man-made staple fibres of viscose; - other artificial man-made staple fibres; - yarn made of polyurethane segmented with flexible segments of polyether, whether or not gimped; - yarn made of polyurethane segmented with flexible segments of polyester, whether or not gimped; - products of heading 5605 (metallised yarn) incorporating strip consisting of a core of aluminium foil or of a core of plastic film whether or not coated with aluminium powder, of a width not exceeding 5 mm, sandwiched by means of a transparent or coloured adhesive between two layers of plastic film; - other products of heading 5605; - glass fibres; - metal fibres.  Example:     25   A yarn, of heading 5205, made from cotton fibres of heading 5203 and synthetic staple fibres of heading 5506, is a mixed yarn. Therefore, non-originating synthetic staple fibres which do not satisfy the origin rules may be used, provided that their total weight does not exceed 10% of the weight of the yarn.  Example:  A woollen fabric, of heading 5112, made from woollen yarn of heading 5107 and synthetic yarn of staple fibres of heading 5509, is a mixed fabric. Therefore, synthetic yarn which does not satisfy the origin rules, or woollen yarn which does not satisfy the origin rules, or a combination of the two, may be used, provided that their total weight does not exceed 10% of the weight of the fabric.  Example:  Tufted textile fabric, of heading 5802, made from cotton yarn of heading 5205 and cotton fabric of heading 5210, is only a mixed product if the cotton fabric is itself a mixed fabric made from yarns classified in two separate headings, or if the cotton yarns used are themselves mixtures.  Example:  If the tufted textile fabric concerned had been made from cotton yarn of heading 5205 and synthetic fabric of heading 5407, then, obviously, the yarns used are two separate basic textile materials and the tufted textile fabric is, accordingly, a mixed product.  6.3. In the case of products incorporating “yarn made of polyurethane segmented with flexible segments of polyether, whether or not gimped”, this tolerance is 20 % in respect of this yarn.  6.4. In the case of products incorporating “strip consisting of a core of aluminium foil or of a core of plastic film whether or not coated with aluminium powder, of a width not exceeding 5 mm, sandwiched by means of a transparent or coloured adhesive between two layers of plastic film”, this tolerance is 30 % in respect of this strip.  Note 7 - Other tolerances applicable to certain textile products  7.1. Where, in the list, reference is made to this Note, textile materials (with the exception of linings and interlinings), which do not satisfy the rule set out in the list in column 3 for the made-up product concerned, may be used, provided that they are classified in a heading other than that of the product and that their value does not exceed 8 % of the ex-works price of the product.  7.2. Without prejudice to Note 6.3, materials, which are not classified within Chapters 50 to 63, may be used freely in the manufacture of textile products, whether or not they contain textiles.     26   Example:  If a rule in the list provides that, for a particular textile item (such as trousers), yarn must be used, this does not prevent the use of metal items, such as buttons, because buttons are not classified within Chapters 50 to 63. For the same reason, it does not prevent the use of slide-fasteners, even though slide-fasteners normally contain textiles.  7.3. Where a percentage rule applies, the value of non-originating materials which are not classified within Chapters 50 to 63 must be taken into account when calculating the value of the non-originating materials incorporated.  Note 8 - Definition of specific processes and simple operations carried out in respect of certain products of Chapter 27  8.1. For the purposes of headings ex 2707 and 2713, the “specific processes” are the following:  (a) vacuum-distillation;  (b) redistillation by a very thorough fractionation process;  (c) cracking;  (d) reforming;  (e) extraction by means of selective solvents;  (f) the process comprising all of the following operations: processing with concentrated sulphuric acid, oleum or sulphuric anhydride; neutralisation with alkaline agents; decolourisation and purification with naturally active earth, activated earth, activated charcoal or bauxite;  (g) polymerisation;  (h) alkylation;  (i) isomerisation.  8.2. For the purposes of headings 2710, 2711 and 2712, the “specific processes” are the following:  (a) vacuum-distillation;  (b) redistillation by a very thorough fractionation process;  (c) cracking;     27   (d) reforming;  (e) extraction by means of selective solvents;  (f) the process comprising all of the following operations: processing with concentrated sulphuric acid, oleum or sulphuric anhydride; neutralisation with alkaline agents; decolourisation and purification with naturally active earth, activated earth, activated charcoal or bauxite;  (g) polymerisation;  (h) alkylation;  (i) isomerisation;  (j) in respect of heavy oils of heading ex 2710 only, desulphurisation with hydrogen, resulting in a reduction of at least 85 % of the sulphur content of the products processed (ASTM D 1266-59 T method);  (k) in respect of products of heading 2710 only, deparaffining by a process other than filtering;  (l) in respect of heavy oils of heading ex 2710 only, treatment with hydrogen, at a pressure of more than 20 bar and a temperature of more than 250 °C, with the use of a catalyst, other than to effect desulphurisation, when the hydrogen constitutes an active element in a chemical reaction. The further treatment, with hydrogen, of lubricating oils of heading ex 2710 (e.g. hydrofinishing or decolourisation), in order, more especially, to improve colour or stability shall not, however, be deemed to be a specific process;  (m) in respect of fuel oils of heading ex 2710 only, atmospheric distillation, on condition that less than 30 % of these products distils, by volume, including losses, at 300 °C, by the ASTM D 86 method;  (n) in respect of heavy oils other than gas oils and fuel oils of heading ex 2710 only, treatment by means of a high-frequency electrical brush discharge;  (o) in respect of crude products (other than petroleum jelly, ozokerite, lignite wax or peat wax, paraffin wax containing by weight less than 0.75 % of oil) of heading ex 2712 only, de-oiling by fractional crystallisation.  8.3. For the purposes of headings ex 2707 and 2713, simple operations, such as cleaning, decanting, desalting, water separation, filtering, colouring, marking, obtaining a sulphur content as a result of mixing products with different sulphur contents, or any combination of these operations or like operations, do not confer origin.
