Article 15.8 Protection of Rights Management Information  1. To protect electronic rights management information4 each Party shall provide adequate legal protection and effective legal remedies against any person knowingly performing                                                            2  For the purposes of this Article, “technological measures” means any technology, device or component  that, in the normal course of its operation, is designed to prevent or restrict acts, in respect of works,  performances, or phonograms, which are not authorised by authors, performers or producers of  phonograms, as provided for by each Party’s domestic law. Without prejudice to the scope of copyright  or related rights contained in each Party’s domestic law, technological measures shall be deemed  effective where the use of protected works, performances, or phonograms is controlled by authors,  performers or producers of phonograms through the application of a relevant access control or  protection process, such as encryption or scrambling, or a copy control mechanism, which achieves the  objective of protection.   3  Nothing in this Chapter shall require Singapore to restrict the importation or domestic sale of a device  that does not render effective a technological measure the sole purpose of which is to control market  segmentation for legitimate copies of motion pictures, and is not otherwise a violation of its domestic  law.  4  For the purposes of this Article, “rights management information” means:  (a)  information that identifies the work, the performance, or the phonogram; the author of the work, the performer of the performance, or the producer of the phonogram; or the owner of any right in the work, performance or phonogram;  (b)  information about the terms and conditions of use of the work, performance, or phonogram; or   Chapter 15 – Intellectual Property  15-4  without authority any of the following acts knowing or, with respect to civil remedies, having reasonable grounds to know, that it will induce, enable, facilitate or conceal an infringement of any copyright or related rights.  Such following acts are:  (a)  to remove or alter any electronic rights management information;  (b)  to distribute, import for distribution, broadcast, communicate, or make available to the public copies of works, performances, or phonograms, knowing that electronic rights management information has been removed or altered without authority.   2. In providing adequate legal protection and effective legal remedies pursuant to paragraph 1, a Party may adopt or maintain appropriate limitations or exceptions to measures implementing paragraph 1. The obligations under paragraph 1 are without prejudice to the rights, limitations, exceptions or defences to copyright or related rights infringement under a Party’s domestic law.  SUBSECTION 15-B-2 TRADEMARKS  Article 15.9 International Agreements  Each Party shall make all reasonable efforts to comply with the Trademark Law Treaty (done at Geneva on 27 October 1994) and the Singapore Treaty on the Law of Trademarks (adopted in Singapore on 27 March 2006).5   Article 15.10 Registration Procedure  Each Party shall provide for a system for the registration of trademarks in which the relevant trademark administration shall give reasons for a refusal to register a trademark in writing. The applicant shall have the opportunity to appeal against such refusal before a judicial authority. Each Party shall introduce the possibility for third parties to oppose trademark applications. Each Party shall provide a publicly available electronic database of trademark applications and trademark registrations.   Article 15.11 Well-Known Trademarks  The Parties shall protect well-known trademarks in accordance with the TRIPS Agreement. In determining whether a trademark is well-known, the Parties agree to take into consideration the Joint Recommendation Concerning Provisions on the Protection of Well-Known Marks                                                                                                                                                                                      (c)  any number or codes that represent the information described in subparagraphs (a) and (b), when any of these items of information is attached to a copy of a work, performance, or phonogram, or appears in connection with the communication or making available of a work, performance or phonogram to the public.  5  Singapore is a party to the Singapore Treaty on the Law of Trademarks. Turkey shall make all  reasonable efforts to facilitate accession to the said Treaty. Chapter 15 – Intellectual Property  15-5  (adopted by the Assembly of the Paris Union for the Protection of Industrial Property and the General Assembly of the WIPO at the Thirty-Fourth Series of Meetings of the Assemblies of the Member States of WIPO on 20 to 29 September 1999).  Article 15.12 Exceptions to the Rights Conferred by a Trademark  Each Party:   (a) shall provide for the fair use of descriptive terms6 as a limited exception to the rights conferred by trademarks; and  (b) may provide for other limited exceptions,   provided that these exceptions take account of the legitimate interests of the owners of the trademarks and of third parties.  SUBSECTION 15-B-3 GEOGRAPHICAL INDICATIONS7  Article 15.13 Scope  1. This Subsection applies to the recognition and protection of geographical indications for goods originating in the territories of the Parties.  2. Geographical indications of a Party to be protected by the other Party shall only be subject to this Subsection if they are recognised and declared as geographical indications in their country of origin.  Article 15.14 System of Protection of Geographical Indications  With the recognition of the importance of the protection of geographical indications, each Party shall provide a system for the protection of geographical indications in accordance with Section 3 (Geographical Indications), Part II of the TRIPS Agreement and protect the geographical indications of the other Party in accordance with its legislation8.   SUBSECTION 15-B-4                                                            6 The fair use of descriptive terms includes the use of a sign to indicate the geographic origin of the  goods or services, and where such use is in accordance with honest practices in industrial or  commercial matters.  7 For the purposes of this Chapter, “geographical indications” means indications which identify a good  as originating in the territory of a Party, or a region or locality in that territory, where a given quality,  reputation or other characteristic of the good is essentially attributable to its geographical origin.  8  For greater certainty, the Parties acknowledge that geographical indications will be recognised and  protected by the Parties only to the extent permitted by and according to the terms and conditions set  out in their respective domestic laws.  Chapter 15 – Intellectual Property  15-6  DESIGNS  Article 15.15 Requirements for Protection of Registered Designs  1. The Parties shall provide for the protection of independently created designs that are new or original.9 This protection shall be provided by registration and shall confer exclusive rights upon their holders in accordance with the provisions of this Subsection.10  2. Design protection shall not extend to designs dictated essentially by technical or functional considerations.  3. A design right shall not subsist in a design which is contrary to public order or to accepted principles of morality.11  Article 15.16 Rights Conferred by Registration  The owner of a protected design shall have the right to prevent third parties, not having the owner’s consent, from at least making, offering for sale, selling or importing articles bearing or embodying a design which is a copy, or substantially a copy, of the protected design, when such acts are undertaken for commercial purposes.   Article 15.17 Term of Protection  The duration of protection available shall be consistent with Article 26.3 of the TRIPS Agreement.   Article 15.18 Exceptions  The Parties may provide limited exceptions to the protection of designs, provided that such exceptions do not unreasonably conflict with the normal exploitation of protected designs and do not unreasonably prejudice the legitimate interests of the owner of the protected design, taking account of the legitimate interests of third parties.                                                            9  The Parties agree that when the domestic law of a Party so provides, individual character of designs  can also be required. This refers to designs that significantly differ from known designs or  combinations of known designs’ features.   10  It is understood that designs are not excluded from protection simply on the basis that they constitute a  part of an article or product, provided that they are visible, fulfil the criteria of this paragraph, and:  (a) fulfil any other criteria for design protection; and  (b) are not otherwise excluded from design protection,    under the Parties’ respective domestic law.  11  Nothing in this Article precludes either Party from providing other specified exclusions from design  protection under its domestic law. The Parties understand that such exclusions shall not be extensive. Chapter 15 – Intellectual Property  15-7   SUBSECTION 15-B-5 PATENTS  Article 15.19 International Agreements  The Parties recall the obligations under the Patent Cooperation Treaty (done at Washington on 19 June 1970, amended on 28 September 1979 and modified on 3 February 1984).

Article 15.20 Patents and Public Health  1. The Parties recognise the importance of the Declaration on the TRIPS Agreement and Public Health (adopted in Doha on 14 November 2001 by the Ministerial Conference of the WTO). In interpreting and implementing the rights and obligations under this Subsection and Subsection 15-B-6 (Protection of Test Data), the Parties shall ensure consistency with this Declaration.  2. The Parties shall respect the Decision of the WTO General Council of 30 August 2003 on Implementation of Paragraph 6 of the Doha Declaration on the TRIPS Agreement and Public Health, as well as the Decision of the WTO General Council of 6 December 2005 on Amendment of the TRIPS Agreement, adopting the Protocol Amending the TRIPS Agreement.

Where a Party provides for measures or procedures to avoid duplicative testing on vertebrate animals with respect to agricultural chemical products, that Party may provide for the conditions and circumstances under which third parties may market the same or similar product, on the basis of the marketing approval granted to the party which had provided the test data or studies.  Chapter 15 – Intellectual Property  15-8  3. Where a Party requires the submission of test data or studies concerning the safety or efficacy of an agricultural chemical product prior to granting an approval for the marketing of such product, the Party shall endeavour to make best efforts to process the application expeditiously with a view to avoiding unreasonable delays.
