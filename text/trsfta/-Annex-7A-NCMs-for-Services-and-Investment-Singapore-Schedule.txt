Conforming Measures) of Chapter 7 (Cross Border Trade in Services) and Article 12.9

imposed by:  
 
(a)  Article 7.4 (Market Access) of Chapter 7 (Cross Border Trade in Services);  
 
(b)  Article 7.3 (National Treatment) of Chapter 7 (Cross Border Trade in Services)

2.  All measures affecting Article 7.3 (National Treatment), Article 7.4 (Market Access) 
and Article 7.5 (Local Presence) of Chapter 7 (Cross Border Trade in Services) and 
Article 12.4 (National Treatment), Article 12.5 (Most-Favoured-Nation Treatment)

Treatment  under  Chapter  7  (Cross  Border  Trade  in  Services)  and  Chapter  12 
(Investment) unless the context or circumstances require otherwise.

are separate disciplines and a measure that is only inconsistent with Local Presence 
need not be reserved against National Treatment.

read  together  with  the  relevant  guidelines,  stated  in  GATT  documents
