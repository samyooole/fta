Where a Party accords recognition autonomously, it shall afford adequate opportunity for the other Party to demonstrate that education, experience, licences, or certifications obtained or requirements met in that other Party’s territory should be recognised.   4.  A Party shall not accord recognition in a manner which would constitute a means of discrimination between countries or customs territories in the application of its standards or criteria for the authorisation, licensing or certification of services suppliers, or a disguised restriction on trade in services.

Article 7.10 Denial of Benefits  A Party may deny the benefits of this Chapter to a service supplier of the other Party if the service is being supplied by an enterprise that has no substantive business operations in the territory of the other Party and it is owned or controlled by persons of a non-Party or the denying Party.   Article 7.11 Review of Commitments  1.  If, after this Agreement enters into force, a Party enters into any agreement on trade in services with a non-Party, it shall give positive consideration to a request by the other Party for the incorporation herein of treatment no less favourable than that provided under the aforesaid agreement.  2.  If, after this Agreement enters into force, a Party further liberalises any of its non-conforming measures in Annex 7-A or sectors, subsectors, or activities in Annex 7-B unilaterally, it shall give positive consideration to a request by the other Party for the incorporation herein of the unilateral liberalisation.  3.   Parties shall discuss in the Joint Committee any request made under paragraph 1 or paragraph 2.  4.   If, after this Agreement enters into force, a service previously supplied in the exercise of governmental authority is subsequently supplied on a commercial basis or in competition with one or more service suppliers, the Party concerned may modify or add to its reservations in respect of that service. At the request of the other Party, the Party concerned shall enter into consultations with a view to ensuring the maintenance of the overall balance of commitments undertaken by each Party under this Agreement.
