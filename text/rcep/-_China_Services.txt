Definitions   �U����� ���� ������� ��������� ��� ������� ���������.     �E�������� ����������� ���� ���������� �� � ������ ������������������ ��������� ������� or service that:  (a) are exclusively or predominantly provided by a single or limited number of suppliers; and  (b) cannot feasibly be economically or technically substituted in order to provide a service.   A ������ ��������� �� � �������� ����� ��� ��� ������� �� ���������� ������ ��� ����� �� participation (having regard to price and supply) in the relevant market for basic telecommunications services as a result of:  (a) control over essential facilities; or  (b) use of its position in the market.  1. Competitive safeguards  1.1 Prevention of anti-competitive practices in telecommunications   Appropriate measures shall be maintained for the purpose of preventing suppliers who, alone or together, are a major supplier from engaging in or continuing anti-competitive practices.  1.2 Safeguards   The anti-competitive practices referred to above shall include in particular:  (a) engaging in anti-competitive cross-subsidisation;  (b) using information obtained from competitors with anti-competitive results; and  (c) not making available to other services suppliers on a timely basis technical information about essential facilities and commercially relevant information which are necessary for them to provide services.  2. Interconnection  2.1 This section applies to linking with suppliers providing public telecommunications transport networks or services in order to allow the users of one supplier to communicate with    ANNEX II � CHINA � 62 users of another supplier and to access services provided by another supplier, where specific commitments are undertaken.  2.2 Interconnection to be ensured   Interconnection with a major supplier will be ensured at any technically feasible point in the network. Such interconnection is provided.  (a) under non-discriminatory terms, conditions (including technical standards and specifications) and rates and of a quality no less favourable than that provided for its own like services or for like services of non-affiliated service suppliers or for its subsidiaries or other affiliates;  (b) in a timely fashion, on terms, conditions (including technical standards and specifications) and cost-oriented rates that are transparent, reasonable, having regard to economic feasibility, and sufficiently unbundled so that the supplier need not pay for network components or facilities that it does not require for the service to be provided; and  (c) upon request, at points in addition to the network termination points offered to the majority of users, subject to charges that reflect the cost of construction of necessary additional facilities.  2.3 Public availability of the procedures for interconnection negotiations   The procedures applicable for interconnection to a major supplier will be made publicly available.  2.4 Transparency of interconnection arrangements   It is ensured that a major supplier will make publicly available either its interconnection agreements or a reference interconnection offer.  2.5 Interconnection: dispute settlement   A service supplier requesting interconnection with a major supplier will have recourse, either:  (a) at any time; or   (b) after a reasonable period of time which has been made publicly known  to an independent domestic body, which may be a regulatory body as referred to in paragraph 5 below, to resolve disputes regarding appropriate terms, conditions and rates for interconnection within a reasonable period of time, to the extent that these have not been established previously.  3. Universal service   Any Party has the right to define the kind of universal service obligation it wishes to maintain. Such obligations will not be regarded as anti-competitive per se, provided they are administered in a transparent, non-discriminatory and competitively neutral manner and are not more burdensome than necessary for the kind of universal service defined by the Party.       4. Public availability of licensing criteria    ANNEX II � CHINA � 63   Where a licence is required, the following will be made publicly available:  (a) all the licensing criteria and the period of time normally required to reach a decision concerning an application for a licence; and  (b) the terms and conditions of individual licences.   The reasons for the denial of a licence will be made known to the applicant upon request.  5. Independent regulators   The regulatory body is separate from, and not accountable to, any supplier of basic telecommunications services. The decisions of and the procedures used by regulators shall be impartial with respect to all market participants.  6. Allocation and use of scarce resources   Any procedures for the allocation and use of scarce resources, including frequencies, numbers and rights of way, will be carried out in an objective, timely, transparent and non-discriminatory manner. The current state of allocated frequency bands will be made publicly available, but detailed identification of frequencies allocated for specific government uses is not required.     ANNEX II � CHINA � 64   WORLD TRADE S/GBT/W/2/Rev.1   16 January 1997 ORGANIZATION    (97-0173)   Group on Basic Telecommunications    Note by the Chairman  Revision   It has been suggested by a number of delegations that it might be helpful to produce a brief and simple note on assumptions applicable to the scheduling of commitments in basic telecoms.  The purpose of the attached note is to assist delegations in ensuring the transparency of their commitments and to promote a better understanding of the meaning of commitments.  This note is not intended to have or acquire any binding legal status.   NOTES FOR SCHEDULING BASIC TELECOM SERVICES COMMITMENTS   1. Unless otherwise noted in the sector column, any basic telecom service listed in the sector column:   (a) encompasses local, long distance and international services for public and non-public use;   (b) may be provided on a facilities-basis or by resale;  and    (c) may be provided through any means of technology (e.g., cable10, wireless, satellites).  2. Subsector (g) --private leased circuit services -- involves the ability of service suppliers to sell or lease any type of network capacity for the supply of services listed in any other basic telecom service subsector unless otherwise noted in the sector column.  This would include capacity via cable, satellite and wireless network.  3. In view of points 1 and 2 above, it should not be necessary to list cellular or mobile services as a separate subsector. However, a number of Members have done so, and a number of offers have commitments only in these subsectors.  Therefore, in order to avoid extensive changes in schedules, it would seem appropriate for Members to maintain separate entries for these subsectors.                                                         10 Including all types of cable.    ANNEX II � CHINA � 65 WORLD TRADE S/GBT/W/2/Rev.1   16 January 1997 ORGANIZATION    (97-0173)     Original:  English Group on Basic Telecommunications   CHAIRMAN'S NOTE  Market Access Limitations on Spectrum Availability    Many Members have entries in the market access column of their schedules indicating that commitments are "subject to availability of spectrum/frequency" or similar wording.  In light of the physical nature of spectrum and the constraints inherent in its use, it is understandable that Members may have sought to rely on these words to adequately protect legitimate spectrum management policies.  There is, however, doubt that words such as "subject to availability of spectrum/frequency" as listed in the market access column of many Members' schedules achieve that objective.   Spectrum/frequency management is not, per se, a measure which needs to be listed under Article XVI.  Furthermore under the GATS each Member has the right to exercise spectrum/frequency management, which may affect the number of service suppliers, provided that this is done in accordance with Article VI and other relevant provisions of the GATS.  This includes the ability to allocate frequency bands taking into account existing and future needs.  Also, Members which have made additional commitment in line with the Reference Paper on regulatory principles are bound by its paragraph 6.   Therefore, words such as "subject to availability of spectrum/frequency" are unnecessary and should be deleted from Members' schedules.        ANNEX II � CHINA � 66 Attachment 3  Distribution Services   Distribution trade services are comprised of four main sub-sectors:  � commission agents services; � wholesaling; � retailing; and � franchising.   The principal services rendered in each subsector can be characterised as reselling merchandise, accompanied by a variety of related subordinated services, including inventory management; assembly, sorting and grading of bulk lots; breaking bulk lots and redistributing into smaller lots; delivery services; refrigeration, storage, warehousing and garage services; sales promotion, marketing and advertising, installation and after sales services including maintenance and repair and training services. Distribution services are generally covered by CPC 61, 62, 63, and 8929.   Commission Agents' Services consist of sales on a fee or contract basis by an agent, broker or auctioneer, or other wholesalers of goods/merchandise and related subordinated services.   Wholesaling consists of the sale of goods/merchandise to retailers to industrial, commercial, institutional, or other professional business users, or to other wholesalers and related subordinated services.   Retailing services consist of the sale of goods/merchandise for personal or household consumption either from a fixed location (e.g., store, kiosk, etc.) or away from a fixed location and related subordinated services.    Franchising services consist of the sale of the use of a product, trade name, or particular business format system in exchange for fees or royalties. Product and trade name franchising involves the use of a trade name in exchange for fees or royalties and may include an obligation for exclusive sale of trade name products. Business format franchising involves the use of an entire business concept in exchange for fees and royalties, and may include the use of a trade name, business plan, and training materials and related subordinated services.    ANNEX II – CHINA – 67 Attachment 4  Insurance: Definition of "Master Policy"   Master policy is the policy that provides blanket coverage for the same legal person's property and liabilities located in different places. Master policy may only be issued by the business department of an insurer's head office or that of its authorised province-level branch offices. Other branches are not allowed to issue master policy.   Master policy business with the state key construction projects as its subject-matter insured.  If investors on the state key construction projects (i.e., projects that are so listed and annually announced by the National Development and Reform Commission) meet either of the following requirements, they may purchase master policy from insurers that are located in the same place as the investors' legal persons do.   The investment on the subject-matter insured is all from China (including the reinvestment from the foreign-invested enterprises in China), and the sum of investment of the investor accounts for over 15 per cent of the total investment.   The investment is partially from abroad, and partially from China (including the reinvestment from the foreign-invested enterprises in China), and the sum of investment of the Chinese investor accounts for over 15 per cent for the total domestic investment.   For those projects that draw investment all from abroad, every insurer may provide coverage in the form of master policies.   Master policy covering different subjects-matter insured of the same legal person.  For those subjects-matter insured located in different places and owned by the same legal person (excluding financial, railway, and post and telecommunications industries and enterprises), master policy may be issued on the basis of either of the following conditions.   For the sake of payment of premium tax, insurance companies incorporated where the legal person or accounting unit of the insurance applicant is located are allowed to issue master policy.   If over 50 per cent of insurance amount of the subject-matter insured is from a larger or medium sized city, then insurers in that city are allowed to issue master policy, no matter whether the insurance applicant's legal person or accounting unit is located in the city.   Motor insurance, credit insurance, employer liabilities insurance, statutory insurance, and other insurance business excluded by the China Banking and Insurance Regulatory Commission cannot be underwritten or co-insured by insurers located other than where the subject-insured are located, or covered under a master policy.
