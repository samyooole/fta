33 For the purposes of this entry, “collective investment scheme” means a “managed investment scheme” as defined under section 
9 of the Corporations Act 2001 (Commonwealth), other than a managed investment scheme operated in contravention of

35 For the purposes of this commitment:  
 
“legal advisory services” includes provision of advice to and consultation with clients in matters, including transactions, 
relationships and disputes, involving the application or interpretation of law; participation with or on behalf of clients in 
negotiations and other dealings with third parties in such matters; and preparation of documents governed in whole or in part 
by law, and the verification of documents of any kind for purposes of and in accordance with the requirements of law.  Does 
not include advice, consultation and documentation services performed by service suppliers entrusted with public functions, 
such as notary services, or services provided by patent or trademarks attorneys.  
 
“legal representational services” includes preparation of documents intended to be submitted to courts, administrative agencies, 
and other duly constituted official tribunals in matters involving the application and interpretation of law; and appearance before 
courts, administrative agencies, and other duly constituted official tribunals in matters involving the application and 
interpretation of the specified body of law.  (Note: The inclusion of representational services before administrative agencies 
and other duly constituted official tribunals within the context of legal services does not necessarily mean that a licensed lawyer 
must supply such services in all cases.  The precise scope of services subject to licensing requirements is subject to the 
discretion of the relevant regulatory authority.) Does not include documentation services performed by service suppliers 
entrusted with public functions, such as notary services, or services provided by patent or trademarks attorneys.  
 
“legal arbitration, conciliation and mediation services” means preparation of documents to be submitted to, preparation for and 
appearance before, an arbitrator, conciliator or mediator in any dispute involving the application and interpretation of law. Does 
not include arbitration, conciliation and mediation services in disputes for which the law has no bearing which fall under services 
incidental to management consulting. As a sub-category, international legal arbitration, conciliation or mediation services refer 
to the same services when the dispute involves parties from two or more countries. 
 
“domestic law (host country law)” means the law of Australia.  
 
“foreign law” means the law of the territories of WTO Members and other countries other than the law of Australia.  
 
“international law” includes law established by international treaties and conventions, as well as customary law. 
 
For the purposes of these definitions:  
 
“arbitration” is taken to mean a process in which the parties to a dispute present arguments and evidence to a dispute resolution 
practitioner (the arbitrator) who makes a determination. 
 
“mediation” is taken to mean a process in which the parties to a dispute, with the assistance of a dispute resolution practitioner 
(the mediator), identify the disputed issues, develop options, consider alternatives and endeavour to reach an agreement. The 
mediator has no advisory or determinative role in regard to the content of the dispute or the outcome of its resolution, but may 
advise on or determine the process of mediation whereby resolution is attempted.
