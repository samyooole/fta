accordance with the definition in the 1991 UN Provisional Central Product Classification (CPC), unless otherwise specified. 
 
2.  The use of the following against individual CPC codes indicates that: 
 
“*” – the service specified is a component of a more aggregated CPC item specified elsewhere in the Services Sectoral Classification List 
 
“**” – the specific commitment for that code does not extend to the total range of services covered under the code. 
 
3.  The scheduling of commitments in this Schedule follows the Guidelines for the Scheduling of Specific Commitments (WTO Document S/L 92, dated 28 
March 2001). The guidelines shall not, however, be construed as being legally binding. 
 
4.  This Schedule is made in accordance with Article 8.7 (Schedules of Specific Commitments) in relation to paragraph 2 of Article 8.3 (Scheduling of

of entry into force of this Agreement for the Philippines.

7.  The entry Unbound* means unbound due to lack of technical feasibility. 
 
8.  In this Schedule, reference is made to the 1987 Philippine Constitution, hence, commitments are to be construed in accordance with the 1987 Philippine 
Constitution. 
 
ANNEX II – THE PHILIPPINES – 1 9.  The Philippines has a State policy and existing laws for the protection of the rights of indigenous peoples and cultural communities, thus, the

reservations and non-conforming measures.
