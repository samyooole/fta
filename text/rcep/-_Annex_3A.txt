 
ANNEX 3A 
 
PRODUCT-SPECIFIC RULES 
 
 
Headnotes to the Annex 
 
 
1.  Pursuant to Article 3.2 (Originating Goods), this Annex sets out 
the conditions required for a good to be treated as an originating 
good. 
 
2.  For greater certainty, the origin criteria of “wholly obtained or 
produced in a Party” and “produced in a Party exclusively from 
originating materials from one or more of the Parties”, as provided 
in subparagraphs (a) and (b) of Article 3.2 (Originating Goods), 
apply to all tariff lines. 
 
3.  For the purposes of interpreting the Product-Specific Rules set 
out in this Annex: 
 
(a)  Section means a section of the Harmonized System; 
 
(b)  Chapter means the first two digits of the tariff classification 
number under the Harmonized System; 
 
(c)   heading means the first four digits of the tariff classification 
number under the Harmonized System; and 
     
(d)   subheading  means  the  first  six  digits  of  the  tariff 
classification number under the Harmonized System. 
 
4.  Where a good is subject to alternative Product-Specific Rules, the 
rule will be considered to be met if the good satisfies one of the 
alternative Product-Specific Rules. 
 
5.  A  requirement  of  a  change  in  tariff  classification  (hereinafter 
referred to as “CTC” in this Annex) applies only to non-originating 
materials. 
 
6.  Where the CTC rule expressly excludes a change from other tariff 
classifications,  the  exclusion  applies  only  to  non-originating 
materials. 
 
7.  For the purposes of this Annex:  
 
3A-1  
(a)  RVC40 means that the good must have a regional value 
content (hereinafter referred to as “RVC” in this Annex) of 
no less than 40 per cent as calculated under Article 3.5 
(Calculation of Regional Value Content); 
 
(b)  CC means that all non-originating materials used in the 
production of the good have undergone a CTC at the two-
digit level of the Harmonized System; 
 
(c)  CTH means that all non-originating materials used in the 
production of the good have undergone a CTC at the four-
digit level of the Harmonized System; 
 
(d)  CTSH means that all non-originating materials used in the 
production of the good have undergone a CTC at the six-
digit level of the Harmonized System;  
 
(e)  WO means wholly obtained or produced in a Party as 
provided  in  Article  3.3  (Goods  Wholly  Obtained  or 
Produced).  For greater certainty, where the rule for a good 
is WO, the good can still meet the requirements to be 
treated as an originating good by being produced in a Party 
exclusively from originating materials from one or more of 
the Parties in accordance with subparagraph (b) of Article 
3.2 (Originating Goods); and 
 
(f)  CR means the chemical reaction rule.  Any good that is a 
product of a chemical reaction shall be considered to be an 
originating  good  if  the  chemical  reaction  occurred  in  a 
Party.  A “chemical reaction” is a process, including a 
biochemical process, which results in a molecule with a 
new structure by breaking intramolecular bonds and by 
forming new intramolecular bonds, or by altering the spatial 
arrangement of atoms in a molecule.  The following are not 
considered to be chemical reactions for the purposes of 
this definition: 
 
(i)  dissolving in water or other solvents; 
 
(ii)  the elimination of solvents including solvent water; 
or 
 
(iii)  the addition or elimination of water of crystallisation. 
   
8.  Where a Product-Specific Rule provides a choice of rules from an 
RVC-based rule of origin, a CTC-based rule of origin, a specific 
3A-2  
manufacturing or processing operation, or a combination of any 
of these, each Party shall permit the exporter of a good to decide 
which rule to use in determining whether the good qualifies as an 
originating good. 
 
9.  This Annex is based on the 2012 Edition of the Harmonized 
System, which entered into force on 1 January 2012 (hereinafter 
referred to as “HS 2012” in this Annex).
