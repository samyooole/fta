ANNEX II – NEW ZEALAND – 1 ANNEX II SCHEDULE OF SPECIFIC COMMITMENTS FOR SERVICES  NEW ZEALAND   EXPLANATORY NOTES   1. Specific commitments in this Schedule are prepared in accordance with the WTO Secretariat paper entitled "Scheduling of Initial Commitments on Trade in Services: Explanatory Note" (MTN.GNS/W/164). The classification of sectors in this Schedule is based on the 1991 provisional Central Product Classification (CPC) of the United Nations Statistical Office, while the ordering reflects the classification system used by the WTO Secretariat in MTN.GNS/W/120. In the context of CPC listings in this Schedule, the use of ** against individual CPC listings indicates that the service specified constitutes only part of the total range of activities covered by the CPC concordance.  Overseas Investment  2. An “overseas person” is defined as an individual not normally resident in New Zealand; a company not incorporated in New Zealand; a New Zealand- incorporated company in which 25 per cent or more of any class of shares or 25 per cent or more of the voting power is held by overseas persons; or a nominee of the overseas person, whether or not the nominee is himself or herself an overseas person.  Maritime Transport Services  3. Cabotage: for the purposes of this Schedule only, “cabotage” is defined as the transportation of passengers or goods between a port located in New Zealand and another port located in New Zealand and traffic originating and terminating in the same port located in New Zealand.  4. Maritime Freight Forwarding Services: the activity consisting of organising and monitoring shipment operations on behalf of shippers, through the acquisition of transport and related services, preparation of documentation, and provision of business information.

ANNEX II – NEW ZEALAND – 2 7. For the purposes of transparency only, the Attachment to this Schedule contains the non-conforming measures New Zealand typically identifies and the policy space typically reserved by New Zealand in its Schedules of Non-Conforming Measures and which New Zealand reserves the right to include in a future Schedule of Non-Conforming Measures under this Agreement.  For greater certainty, the Attachment to this Schedule is not a non-binding transparency list pursuant to Article 8.10 (Transparency List).  8.
