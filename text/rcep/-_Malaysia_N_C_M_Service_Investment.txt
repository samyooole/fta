identified in the Description element of that entry. 
 
4.  With respect to the entries in this List on Most-Favoured-Nation Treatment relating to bilateral or 
multilateral international agreements, the absence of language regarding the scope of the 
reservation for differential treatment resulting from an amendment of those bilateral or multilateral 
international agreements in force or signed prior to the date of entry into force of this Agreement 
is without prejudice to Malaysia’s interpretation of the scope of that reservation.

conforming measure, according to the Provisional Central Product Classification (Statistical 
Papers Series M No. 77, Department of International Economic and Social Affairs, Statistical 
Office of the United Nations, New York, 1991). The use of “**” against individual CPC codes 
indicates that the specific commitment for that code does not extend to the total range of services 
covered under that code.
