ANNEX II 
SCHEDULE OF SPECIFIC COMMITMENTS FOR SERVICES 
 
THAILAND 
 
 
EXPLANATORY NOTES 
 
 
1. 
This Schedule sets out Thailand’s commitments in accordance with Article 8.7 (Schedules of Specific Commitments). 
 
2. 
The classification of service sectors in this Schedule is based on the 1991 provisional Central Product Classification (CPC) CPC Version 1.1 and Version 
2.1 of the United Nations Statistical Office unless otherwise indicated by the absence of a CPC number. The ordering reflects the services sectoral 
classification list as used in the GATT document MTN.GNS/W/120 dated 10 July 1991. The scheduling of specific commitments follows the guidelines 
stated in GATT documents MTN.GNS/W/164 dated 3 September 1993 and MTN.GNS/W/164/Add.1 dated 30 November 1993. 
 
3. 
The use of “**” against individual CPC codes indicates that the specific commitment for that code shall not extend to the total range of services covered 
under that code. The entry “Unbound*” means unbound due to lack of technical feasibility. 
 
4. 
For greater certainty, paragraphs 3 and 4 of Article 8.7 (Schedules of Specific Commitments) shall only apply to sectors or subsectors which have “FL” 
indicated. These paragraphs shall only apply to Mode 3 commitments. 
 
5. 
Paragraph 4 of Article 8.7 (Schedules of Specific Commitments) shall apply to sectors or subsectors which have “FL” indicated subsequent to the 
amendment of Thailand’s laws such as national legislations, acts, royal decrees, or ministerial regulations but not subsequent to the amendment of 
cabinet, administrative, and ministerial decisions. 
 
6. 
In accordance with subparagraph 1(a) of Article 8.6 (Most-Favoured-Nation Treatment), Thailand indicates “MFN” against sectors or subsectors subject 
to Article 8.6 (Most-Favoured-Nation Treatment). 
 
 
Modes of Supply:         1) Cross-border Supply         2) Consumption abroad         3) Commercial presence         4) Presence of natural persons
