Document MTN.GNS/W/120 dated 10 July 1991). 
 
2. 
The alphabetical and numerical divisions are only indicative of the description of specific commitments, but shall not be construed as being a part of the 
specific commitments. 
 
3. 
The use of “**” against individual CPC codes indicates that the specific commitment for that code does not extend to the total range of services covered 
under that code. “CPC codes” means the codes as used in the Provisional Central Product Classification (Statistical Papers Series M No. 77, 
Department of International Economic and Social Affairs, Statistical Office of the United Nations, New York, 1991). 
 
4. 
For greater certainty, in accordance with Article 8.12 (Transition), Viet Nam reserves the rights to adopt or maintain any measure affecting the supply of 
services when making commitments with respect to Article 8.11 (Local Presence), Article 10.6 (Prohibition of Performance Requirements), and Article 
10.7 (Senior Management and Board of Directors) under the transition process. 
 
5. 
For greater certainty, consistent with paragraph 3 of Article 8.12 (Transition), nothing in this Agreement shall be construed to require Viet Nam to make 
Most-Favoured-Nation (MFN) commitments on sectors or subsectors other than those marked with “MFN” in this Schedule under the transition process. 
 
6. 
Viet Nam reserves the right to adopt or maintain any measure with respect to all sectors not identified in this Schedule, including new services. 
 
7. 
For greater certainty, notwithstanding subparagraph 3(e)(iv) through (vi) of Article 8.2 (Scope), Viet Nam reserves the right to adopt or maintain any 
measure relating to specialty air services, ground handling services, and airport operation services. 
 
8. 
For greater certainty, Viet Nam does not recognise permanent residents as natural persons according to its laws and regulations. 
 
9. 
For greater certainty, paragraphs 3 and 4 of Article 8.7 (Schedules of Specific Commitments), and subparagraph 1(a) of Article 8.6 (Most-Favoured-
Nation Treatment) shall only apply to sectors or subsectors which have “FL” and “MFN” indicated, respectively. 
 
10. 
The mode for the supply of a service referred to in subparagraph (r)(iv) of Article 8.1 (Definitions) shall not be subject to obligations under Article 8.6 
(Most-Favoured-Nation Treatment), paragraphs 3 and 4 of Article 8.7 (Schedules of Specific Commitments), and Article 8.10 (Transparency List).

REFERENCE PAPER 
 
NOTE TO THE SCHEDULE  
 
 
I. 
SCOPE 
 
The following are definitions and principles on the regulatory framework for the basic 
telecommunications services.   
Definitions 
 
Users mean service consumers and service suppliers.   
 
Essential facilities mean facilities of a public telecommunications transport network or 
service that 
(a) 
are exclusively or predominantly provided by a single or limited number of suppliers; 
and 
(b) 
cannot feasibly be economically or technically substituted in order to provide a 
service. 
 
A major supplier is a supplier which has the ability to materially affect the terms of 
participation (having regard to price and supply) in the relevant market for basic 
telecommunications services as a result of: 
 
(a) 
control over essential facilities; or 
 
(b) 
use of its position in the market. 
1. Competitive safeguards 
1.1 
Prevention of anti-competitive practices in telecommunications 
 
Appropriate measures shall be maintained for the purpose of preventing suppliers 
who, alone or together, are a major supplier from engaging in or continuing anti-
competitive practices. 
1.2 
Safeguards 
 
The anti-competitive practices referred to above shall include in particular: 
(a) 
engaging in anti-competitive cross-subsidisation;   
(b) 
using information obtained from competitors with anti-competitive results; and 
(c) 
not making available to other services suppliers on a timely basis technical 
information about essential facilities and commercially relevant information 
which are necessary for them to provide services. 
2. Interconnection 
2.1 
This section applies to linking with suppliers providing public telecommunications 
transport networks or services in order to allow the users of one supplier to 
communicate with users of another supplier and to access services provided by 
another supplier, where specific commitments are undertaken. 
ANNEX II – VIET NAM – 61 
2.2 
Interconnection to be ensured 
 
Interconnection with a major supplier will be ensured at any technically feasible point 
in the network.  Such interconnection is provided. 
(a) 
under non-discriminatory terms, conditions (including technical standards and 
specifications) and rates and of a quality no less favourable than that 
provided for its own like services or for like services of non-affiliated service 
suppliers or for its subsidiaries or other affiliates; 
(b) 
in a timely fashion, on terms, conditions (including technical standards and 
specifications) and cost-oriented rates that are transparent, reasonable, 
having regard to economic feasibility, and sufficiently unbundled so that the 
supplier need not pay for network components or facilities that it does not 
require for the service to be provided; and 
(c) 
upon request, at points in addition to the network termination points offered to 
the majority of users, subject to charges that reflect the cost of construction of 
necessary additional facilities. 
2.3 
Public availability of the procedures for interconnection negotiations 
 
The procedures applicable for interconnection to a major supplier will be made 
publicly available. 
2.4 
Transparency of interconnection arrangements 
 
It is ensured that a major supplier will make publicly available either its 
interconnection agreements or a reference interconnection offer. 
2.5 
Interconnection:  dispute settlement 
A service supplier requesting interconnection with a major supplier will have recourse, 
either: 
 
(a) 
at any time; or 
(b) 
after a reasonable period of time which has been made publicly known to an 
independent domestic body, which may be a regulatory body as referred to in 
paragraph 5 below, to resolve disputes regarding appropriate terms, 
conditions and rates for interconnection within a reasonable period of time, to 
the extent that these have not been established previously. 
3. Universal service 
 
Any Party has the right to define the kind of universal service obligation it wishes to maintain.  
Such obligations will not be regarded as anti-competitive per se, provided they are 
administered in a transparent, non-discriminatory and competitively neutral manner and are 
not more burdensome than necessary for the kind of universal service defined by the Party. 
4. Public availability of licensing criteria 
 
Where a licence is required, the following will be made publicly available: 
(a) 
all the licensing criteria and the period of time normally required to reach a decision 
concerning an application for a licence; and 
(b) 
the terms and conditions of individual licenses. 
 
The reasons for the denial of a licence will be made known to the applicant upon request. 
ANNEX II – VIET NAM – 62 
5. Independent regulators 
 
The regulatory body is separate from, and not accountable to, any supplier of basic 
telecommunications services. The decisions of and the procedures used by regulators shall 
be impartial with respect to all market participants. 
6. Allocation and use of scarce resources 
 
Any procedures for the allocation and use of scarce resources, including frequencies, 
numbers and rights of way, will be carried out in an objective, timely, transparent, and non-
discriminatory manner.  The current state of allocated frequency bands will be made publicly 
available, but detailed identification of frequencies allocated for specific government uses is 
not required.
