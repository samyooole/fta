NOTE TO THE SCHEDULE  
 
 
I.  SCOPE 
 
The  following  are  definitions  and  principles  on  the  regulatory  framework  for  the  basic 
telecommunications services.   
Definitions 
  Users mean service consumers and service suppliers.   
  Essential  facilities  mean  facilities  of  a  public  telecommunications  transport  network  or 
service that 
(a)  are exclusively or predominantly provided by a single or limited number of suppliers; 
and 
(b)  cannot  feasibly  be  economically  or  technically  substituted  in  order  to  provide  a 
service. 
  A  major  supplier  is  a  supplier  which  has  the  ability  to  materially  affect  the  terms  of 
participation  (having  regard  to  price  and  supply)  in  the  relevant  market  for  basic 
telecommunications services as a result of: 
  (a)  control over essential facilities; or 
  (b)  use of its position in the market. 
1. Competitive safeguards 
1.1  Prevention of anti-competitive practices in telecommunications 
  Appropriate measures shall be maintained for the purpose of preventing suppliers 
who, alone or together, are a major supplier from engaging in or continuing anti-
competitive practices. 
1.2  Safeguards 
  The anti-competitive practices referred to above shall include in particular: 
(a)  engaging in anti-competitive cross-subsidisation;   
(b)  using information obtained from competitors with anti-competitive results; and 
(c)  not making available to other services suppliers on a timely basis technical 
information about essential facilities and commercially relevant information 
which are necessary for them to provide services. 
2. Interconnection 
2.1  This section applies to linking with suppliers providing public telecommunications 
transport  networks  or  services  in  order  to  allow  the  users  of  one  supplier  to 
communicate with users of another supplier and to access services provided by 
another supplier, where specific commitments are undertaken. 
ANNEX II – VIET NAM – 60 2.2  Interconnection to be ensured 
  Interconnection with a major supplier will be ensured at any technically feasible point 
in the network.  Such interconnection is provided. 
(a)  under non-discriminatory terms, conditions (including technical standards and 
specifications)  and  rates  and  of  a  quality  no  less  favourable  than  that 
provided for its own like services or for like services of non-affiliated service 
suppliers or for its subsidiaries or other affiliates; 
(b)  in a timely fashion, on terms, conditions (including technical standards and 
specifications)  and  cost-oriented  rates  that  are  transparent,  reasonable, 
having regard to economic feasibility, and sufficiently unbundled so that the 
supplier need not pay for network components or facilities that it does not 
require for the service to be provided; and 
(c)  upon request, at points in addition to the network termination points offered to 
the majority of users, subject to charges that reflect the cost of construction of 
necessary additional facilities. 
2.3  Public availability of the procedures for interconnection negotiations 
  The procedures applicable for  interconnection to  a major  supplier  will be made 
publicly available. 
2.4  Transparency of interconnection arrangements 
  It  is  ensured  that  a  major  supplier  will  make  publicly  available  either  its 
interconnection agreements or a reference interconnection offer. 
2.5  Interconnection:  dispute settlement 
A service supplier requesting interconnection with a major supplier will have recourse, 
either: 
  (a)  at any time; or 
(b)  after a reasonable period of time which has been made publicly known to an 
independent domestic body, which may be a regulatory body as referred to in 
paragraph  5  below,  to  resolve  disputes  regarding  appropriate  terms, 
conditions and rates for interconnection within a reasonable period of time, to 
the extent that these have not been established previously. 
3. Universal service 
  Any Party has the right to define the kind of universal service obligation it wishes to maintain.  
Such  obligations  will  not  be  regarded  as  anti-competitive  per  se,  provided  they  are 
administered in a transparent, non-discriminatory and competitively neutral manner and are 
not more burdensome than necessary for the kind of universal service defined by the Party. 
4. Public availability of licensing criteria 
  Where a licence is required, the following will be made publicly available: 
(a)  all the licensing criteria and the period of time normally required to reach a decision 
concerning an application for a licence; and 
(b)  the terms and conditions of individual licenses. 
  The reasons for the denial of a licence will be made known to the applicant upon request. 
ANNEX II – VIET NAM – 61 5. Independent regulators 
  The  regulatory  body  is  separate  from,  and  not  accountable  to,  any  supplier  of  basic 
telecommunications services. The decisions of and the procedures used by regulators shall 
be impartial with respect to all market participants. 
6. Allocation and use of scarce resources 
  Any  procedures  for  the  allocation  and  use  of  scarce  resources,  including  frequencies, 
numbers and rights of way, will be carried out in an objective, timely, transparent, and non-
discriminatory manner.  The current state of allocated frequency bands will be made publicly 
available, but detailed identification of frequencies allocated for specific government uses is 
not required.
