EXPLANATORY NOTES 
 
 
1. 
This List sets out, pursuant to Article 8.8 (Schedules of Non-Conforming Measures) and Article 
10.8 (Reservations and Non-Conforming Measures), Korea’s existing measures that are not 
subject to some or all of the obligations imposed by: 
 
(a) 
Article 8.4 (National Treatment) or 10.3 (National Treatment); 
 
(b) 
Article 8.5 (Market Access); 
 
(c) 
Article 
8.6 
(Most-Favoured-Nation 
Treatment) 
or 
10.4 
(Most-Favoured-Nation 
Treatment); 
 
(d) 
Article 8.11 (Local Presence); 
 
(e) 
Article 10.6 (Prohibition of Performance Requirements); or 
 
(f) 
Article 10.7 (Senior Management and Board of Directors). 
 
2. 
Each List entry sets out the following elements: 
 
(a) 
Sector refers to the sector for which the entry is made; 
 
(b) 
Level of Government 1  indicates the level of government maintaining the listed 
measures;  
 
(c) 
Obligations Concerned specifies the Articles referred to in paragraph 1 that, pursuant 
to subparagraph 1(a) of Article 8.8 (Schedules of Non-Conforming Measures) and 
subparagraph 1(a) of Article 10.8 (Reservations and Non-Conforming Measures), do not 
apply to the non-conforming aspects of the law, regulation, or other measure, as set out 
in paragraph 3; 
 
(d) 
Description sets out commitments, if any, for liberalisation on the date of entry into force 
of this Agreement, and the remaining non-conforming aspects of the measure for which 
the entry is made; and 
 
(e) 
Measures2 identify the laws, regulations, or other measures for which the entry is made. 
A measure cited in the Measures element: 
 
(i) 
means the measure as amended, continued, or renewed as of the date of entry 
into force of this Agreement; and 
 
(ii) 
includes any subordinate measure adopted or maintained under the authority of 
and consistent with the measure. 
 
3. 
In the interpretation of a List entry, all elements of the entry shall be considered.  An entry shall 
be interpreted in light of the relevant articles of the Chapters against which the entry is made. 
To the extent that: 
 
(a) 
the Measures element is qualified by a liberalisation commitment from the Description  
element, the Measures element as so qualified shall prevail over all other elements; and 
                                                      
1 If none is specified, the measure is maintained at the central level of government. 
 
2 For greater certainty, for  Korea, a change in the level of government at which a measure is administered or enforced does 
not, by itself, decrease the conformity of the measure with the obligations referred to in paragraph 1 of Article 8.8 (Schedules of 
Non-Conforming Measures) and paragraph 1 of Article 10.8 (Reservations and Non-Conforming Measures). 
 
 
 
ANNEX III – KOREA – 3 
 
(b) 
the Measures element is not so qualified, the Measures element shall prevail over all 
other elements, unless any discrepancy between the Measures element and the other 
elements considered in their totality is so substantial and material that it would be 
unreasonable to conclude that the Measures element should prevail, in which case the 
other elements shall prevail to the extent of that discrepancy. 
 
4. 
In accordance with subparagraph 1(a) of Article 8.8 (Schedules of Non-Conforming Measures) 
and subparagraph 1(a) of Article 10.8 (Reservations and Non-Conforming Measures), and 
subject to subparagraph 1(c) of Article 8.8 (Schedules of Non-Conforming Measures) and 
subparagraph 1(c) of Article 10.8 (Reservations and Non-Conforming Measures), the Articles of 
this Agreement specified in the Obligations Concerned element of an entry do not apply to the 
non-conforming aspects of the law, regulation, or other measure identified in the Measures 
element of that entry. 
 
5. 
Where Korea maintains a measure that requires that a service provider be a citizen, permanent 
resident, or resident of its territory as a condition to the provision of a service in its territory, a 
List entry for that measure taken with respect to Article 8.4 (National Treatment), Article 8.6 
(Most-Favoured-Nation Treatment), or Article 8.11 (Local Presence) shall operate as a List 
entry with respect to Article 10.3 (National Treatment), Article 10.4 (Most-Favoured-Nation 
Treatment), or Article 10.6 (Prohibition of Performance Requirements) to the extent of that 
measure. 
 
6. 
For Korea, a foreign person means a foreign national or an enterprise organised under the 
laws of another country. 
 
7. 
For greater certainty, Article 8.11 (Local Presence) and Article 8.4 (National Treatment) are 
separate disciplines and a measure that is only inconsistent with Article 8.11 (Local Presence) 
need not be reserved against Article 8.4 (National Treatment).

EXPLANATORY NOTES 
 
 
1. 
All the commitments in this Appendix are subject to entry requirements, domestic laws, regulations, rules, guidelines, terms and conditions of the 
Financial Services Commission (FSC) or any other relevant regulatory authorities in Korea, which are consistent with Article VI of GATS and 
paragraph 2 of the Annex on Financial Services of GATS.  
 
2. 
Financial sectors are basically re-classified according to the category of the Annex 8A (Financial Services). Therefore the order of subsectors is 
different from that of the commitment in GATS/SC/48/Suppl.3/Rev.1.  
 
3. 
Specific statements in the subsectors apply only to existing domestic financial services.  
 
4. 
All financial services are subject to the following provisions. 
 
(a) 
For prudential reasons within the context of the Annex 8A (Financial Services), Korea shall not be prevented from taking measures including 
requirements related to parent companies, the minimum capital requirement, minimum operating funds requirement, business worker's 
licence and approval for business activities.  
 
(b) 
A financial institution must be established for only one business defined in related law and thus cannot engage in other business activities 
regulated by other relevant laws.  
 
(c) 
Cross-border supply of financial services and supply through consumer movement may not be settled in Korean currency. After the 
establishment of a commercial presence, financial institutions may handle only transactions, denominated and settled in Korean currency, 
with residents. Approval is required for transactions denominated or settled in foreign currency or transactions with non-residents.  
 
(d) 
Assets owned by branches must be kept within the territory of Korea. Capital of the head office is not recognised as the basis for determining 
the extent of funding and lending activities of domestic branches. 
 
(e)

(f) 
The management and operation of assets of a financial institution are restricted. 
 
(g)
