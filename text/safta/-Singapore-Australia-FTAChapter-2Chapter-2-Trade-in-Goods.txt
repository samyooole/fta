Each Party shall adopt and maintain procedures providing for the expeditious release of goods admitted under this Article. To the extent possible, those procedures shall provide that when a good admitted under this Article accompanies a national of the other Party who is seeking temporary entry, the good shall be released simultaneously with the entry of that national.  7  7. Each Party shall permit a good temporarily admitted under this Article to be exported through a customs port other than the port through which it was admitted.  8.

The Parties understand that the GATT 1994 rights and obligations incorporated by paragraph 1 prohibit, in any circumstances in which any other form of restriction is prohibited, a Party from adopting or maintaining:  (a) export and import price requirements, except as permitted in enforcement of countervailing and anti-dumping duty orders and undertakings;  8  (b) import licensing conditioned on the fulfilment of a performance requirement; or   (c) voluntary export restraints inconsistent with Article VI of the GATT 1994, as implemented under Article 18 of the SCM Agreement and Article 8.1 of the AD Agreement.  3.

In the event that a Party adopts or maintains a prohibition or restriction on the importation of a good from a non-Party, it shall, on the request of the other Party, consult with the other Party a view to avoiding undue interference with or distortion of pricing, marketing, or distribution arrangements in that other Party.   7. Neither Party shall, as a condition for engaging in importation or for the importation of a good, require a person of the other Party to establish or maintain a contractual or other relationship with a distributor in its territory.   8. For greater certainty, paragraph 7 does not prevent a Party from requiring a person referred to in that paragraph to designate a point of contact for the purpose of facilitating communications between its regulatory authorities and that person.   ARTICLE 9  Remanufactured Goods  1. For greater certainty, Article 8.1 (Import and Export Restrictions) shall apply to prohibitions and restrictions on the importation of remanufactured goods.  9  2. If a Party adopts or maintains measures prohibiting or restricting the importation of used goods, it shall not apply those measures to remanufactured goods.1   ARTICLE 10  Import Licensing  1. Neither Party shall adopt or maintain a measure that is inconsistent with the Import Licensing Agreement.  2.

Each Party shall also publish on an official government website any information that it is required to publish under Article 1.4(a) of the Import Licensing Agreement.   5. Each Party shall notify the other Party of any new import licensing procedures it adopts and any modifications it makes to its existing import licensing procedures, if possible, no later than 60 days before the new procedure or modification takes effect.                                                  1 For greater certainty, subject to its obligations under this Agreement and the WTO Agreement, a Party may require that remanufactured goods:  (a) be identified as such for distribution or sale in its territory; and  (b) meet all applicable technical requirements that apply to equivalent goods in new condition. 10  In no case shall a Party provide the notification later than 60 days after the date of its publication. The notification shall include any information required under paragraph 6. A Party shall be deemed to be in compliance with this obligation if it notifies a new import licensing procedure or a modification to an existing import licensing procedure to the WTO Committee on Import Licensing in accordance with Articles 5.1, 5.2 or 5.3 of the Import Licensing Agreement, and includes in its notification any information required to be notified to the other Party under paragraph 6.  6.

Each Party shall respond within 60 days to a reasonable enquiry from the other Party concerning its licensing rules and its procedures for the submission of an application for an import licence, including the eligibility of persons, firms and institutions to make an application, the administrative body or bodies to be approached and the list of products subject to the licensing requirement.  8. If a Party denies an import licence application with respect to a good of the other Party, it shall, on request of the applicant and within a reasonable period after receiving the request, provide the applicant with a written explanation of the reason for the denial.  11  9. Neither Party shall apply an import licensing procedure to a good of the other Party unless it has, with respect to that procedure, met the requirements of paragraph 2 or paragraph 4, as applicable.   ARTICLE 11  Export Duties  A Party shall not impose any export duty on the goods set out in Annex 1 (Export Duties), when exported from its territory to the territory of the other Party.

ARTICLE 18  General Exceptions  Subject to the requirement that such measures are not applied in a manner which would constitute a means of arbitrary or unjustifiable discrimination between the Parties where the same conditions prevail, or a disguised restriction on international trade, nothing in this Chapter shall be construed to prevent the adoption or enforcement by a Party of measures:  (a) necessary to protect public morals;  (b) necessary to protect human, animal or plant life or health;  (c) relating to the importations or exportations of gold or silver;  (d) necessary to secure compliance with laws or regulations which are not inconsistent with this Chapter, including those relating to customs enforcement, the enforcement of monopolies operated under paragraph 4 of Article II and Article XVII of the GATT 1994, the protection of patents, trademarks and copyrights, and the prevention of deceptive practices;  (e) relating to the products of prison labour;  (f) imposed for the protection of national treasures of artistic, historic or archaeological value;  (g) relating to the conservation of exhaustible natural resources if such measures are made effective in conjunction with restrictions on domestic production or consumption;  (h) undertaken in pursuance of obligations under any intergovernmental commodity agreement which conforms to criteria submitted to the WTO and not disapproved by it or which is itself so submitted and not so disapproved;  (i) involving restrictions on exports of domestic materials necessary to ensure essential quantities of such materials to a domestic processing industry during periods when the domestic price of such materials is held below the world price as part of a governmental stabilization plan; Provided that such restrictions shall not operate to increase the exports of or the protection afforded to such domestic industry, and shall not 14  depart from the provisions of this Chapter relating to non-discrimination;  (j) essential to the acquisition or distribution of products in general or local short supply; Provided that any such measures shall be consistent with the principle that all WTO members are entitled to an equitable share of the international supply of such products, and that any such measures, which are inconsistent with this Chapter shall be discontinued as soon as the conditions giving rise to them have ceased to exist.
