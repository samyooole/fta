 
Annex 2: Product-Specific Rules of Origin 
 
 
Section A: Introductory Notes 
 
 
1.  The specific rule, or specific set of rules, that applies to a particular subheading 
is set out immediately adjacent to the subheading, heading, or chapter, as applicable. 
 
2.  Where a tariff heading or sub-heading is subject to alternative Product Specific 
Rules, it shall be sufficient to comply with one of the rules. 
 
3.  A requirement of a change in tariff classification applies only to non-originating 
materials. 
 
4.  Where the change in tariff classification rule expressly excludes a change from 
other tariff classifications, the exclusion applies only to non-originating materials. 
 
5.  For the purposes of this Annex:  
 
“subheading” means the first six digits in the tariff classification number under 
the Harmonized System; 
 
“heading” means the first four digits in the tariff classification number under 
the Harmonized System; and 
 
“chapter” means the first two digits in the tariff classification number under the 
Harmonized System. 
 
6.  For the purposes of column 3 of this Annex:  
 
“CC” means that all non-originating materials used in the production of the 
good have undergone a change in tariff classification at the 2-digit level; 
 
“CTH” means that all non-originating materials used in the production of the 
good have undergone a change in tariff classification at the 4-digit level; 
 
“CTSH” means that all non-originating materials used in the production of the 
good have undergone a change in tariff classification at the 6-digit level; 
 
“RVC(40)” means that the good must have a regional value content of not less 
than 40 per cent as calculated under Article 3.5;  
 
“RVC(BD40)” means that the good must have a regional value content of not 
less than 40 per cent using the build-down method as calculated under Article 
3.5; and 
 
ANNEX 2 – HEADNOTES – 1 “RVC(BU30/BD40)” means that the good must have a regional value content 
of either not less than 30 per cent using the build-up method or not less than 40 
per cent using the build-down method, as calculated under Article 3.5. 
 
 
Section B: Chemical Chapter Origin Rules 
 
 
7.  Chemical Reaction Origin Rule: 
 
Notwithstanding the applicable product-specific rules of origin,  a good of 
chapter 27 through 40 that is the product of a chemical reaction is an originating good 
if the chemical reaction occurred in the territory of one or more of the Parties.  
 
For the purposes of this rule, a “chemical reaction” is a process (including a 
biochemical process) which results in a molecule with a new structure by breaking 
intramolecular bonds and by forming new intramolecular bonds, or by altering the 
spatial arrangement of atoms in a molecule. The following are not chemical reactions:  
 
(a)  dissolving in water or other solvents;  
 
(b)  the elimination of solvents, including solvent water; or 
 
(c)  the addition or elimination of water of crystallization. 
 
8.  Distillation Rule 
 
Notwithstanding the applicable product-specific rules of origin,  a good of 
heading 27.10 that undergoes atmospheric or vacuum distillation in the territory of one 
or more of the Parties is an originating good. For the purposes of this rule: 
 
(a)   Atmospheric distillation means a separation process in which petroleum 
oils are converted, in a distillation tower, into fractions according to 
boiling point and the vapour then condensed into different liquefied 
fractions.  Goods  produced  from  petroleum  distillation  may  include 
liquefied petroleum gas, naphtha, gasoline, kerosene, diesel/heating oil, 
light gas oils, and lubricating oil; and  
 
(b)  Vacuum distillation means distillation at a pressure below atmospheric 
but not so low that it would be classed as molecular distillation. Vacuum 
distillation is used for distilling high-boiling and heat-sensitive materials 
such as heavy distillates in petroleum oils to produce light to heavy 
vacuum gas oils and residuum. In some refineries, gas oils may be 
further processed into lubricating oils. 
 
9.  Direct Blending Rule 
 
Notwithstanding the applicable product-specific rules of origin,  a good of 
heading 27.10 that undergoes “direct blending” in the territory of one or more of the 
Parties is an originating good. For the purposes of this rule, “direct blending” means a 
ANNEX 2 – HEADNOTES – 2 process  whereby  various  petroleum  streams  from  processing  units  or  petroleum 
components from holding or storage tanks are combined to create a finished product 
with pre-determined parameters, provided that the non-originating material of heading 
27.10 constitutes no more than 25 per cent by volume of the good. 
 
10.  Diluent Rule 
 
For the purposes of determining whether or not a good of heading 27.09 is an 
originating good, the origin of diluent of heading 27.09 or 27.10 that is used to facilitate 
the transportation between Parties of crude petroleum oils and crude oils obtained from 
bituminous  minerals  of  heading  27.09  is  disregarded,  provided  that  the  diluent 
constitutes no more than 40 per cent by volume of the good. 
 
11.  Purification Rule 
 
Notwithstanding the applicable product-specific rules of origin,  a good of 
chapter 28 through 35 or chapter 38, that is subject to purification is an originating good 
if that purification occurs in the territory of one or more of the Parties and results in the 
elimination of not less than 80 per cent of the content of existing impurities. 
 
12.  Mixing and Blending Rule 
 
Notwithstanding the applicable product-specific rules of origin,  a good of 
chapter 30 or 31, heading 33.02 subheading 35.02.20, or headings 35.06 through 35.07 
or 37.07, is an originating good if, in the territory of one or more of the Parties, the 
deliberate and proportionally controlled mixing or blending (including dispersing) of 
materials to conform to predetermined specifications results in the production of a good 
having physical or chemical characteristics that are relevant to the purposes or uses of 
the good and are different from the input materials. 
 
13.  Change in Particle Size Rule  
 
Notwithstanding the applicable product-specific rules of origin,  a good of 
chapter 30 or 31, subheading 3204.17 or heading 33.04 is an originating good if, in the 
territory of one or more of the Parties, the deliberate and controlled modification in 
particle size of a good occurs, including micronizing by dissolving a polymer and 
subsequent precipitation, other than by merely crushing or pressing, resulting in a good 
with a defined particle size, defined particle size distribution or defined surface area, 
that is relevant to the purposes of the resulting good and with different physical or 
chemical characteristics from the input materials. 
 
14.  Standards Materials Rule 
 
Notwithstanding the applicable product-specific rules of origin, a standards 
material of chapter 28 through 38, except for a good of heading 35.01 through 35.05 or 
subheading 3824.60, is an originating good if the production of such good occurs in the 
territory of one or more of the Parties. For the purposes of this rule, a “standards 
material”  (including  a  standard  solution)  is  a  preparation  suitable  for  analytical, 
calibrating or referencing uses with precise degrees of purity or proportions certified by 
the manufacturer. 
ANNEX 2 – HEADNOTES – 3  
15.  Isomer Separation Rule 
 
Notwithstanding the applicable product-specific rules of origin,  a good of 
chapter 28 through 38 is an originating good if the isolation or separation of isomers 
from mixtures of isomers occurs in the territory of one or more of the Parties.
