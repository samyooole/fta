goods of the same class or kind as the self-produced material that 
is being valued.  
 
 
ARTICLE 8 
 
Further Adjustments to the Value of Materials 
 
1.  
Each Party shall provide that for an originating material, the following expenses 
may be added to the value of the material, if not included under Article 7 (Value of 
Materials Used in Production):

the costs of freight, insurance, packing and all other costs incurred to 
transport the material to the location of the producer of the good; 
 
(b) 
duties, taxes and customs brokerage fees on the material, paid in the 
territory of one or both of the Parties, other than duties and taxes that are 
waived, refunded, refundable or otherwise recoverable, which include 
credit against duty or tax paid or payable; and 
 
(c)

instructional or other information materials, as described in paragraph 3, 
are to be disregarded; or   
 
9 
 
(b) 
in determining whether a good meets a regional value content 
requirement, the value of the accessories, spare parts, tools or

out in Annex 2 (Product-Specific Rules of Origin) or whether the good is wholly 
obtained or produced.  
 
2. 
Each Party shall provide that if a good is subject to a regional value content 
requirement, the value of the packaging materials and containers in which the good is 
packaged for retail sale, if classified with the good, are taken into account as originating
