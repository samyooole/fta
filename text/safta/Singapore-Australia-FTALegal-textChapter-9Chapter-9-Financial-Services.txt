Each Party shall accord to financial institutions of the other Party, and to investments of investors of the other Party in financial institutions, treatment no less favourable than that it accords to its own financial institutions, and to investments of its own investors in financial institutions, in like circumstances, with respect to the establishment, acquisition, expansion, management, conduct, operation, and sale or other disposition of financial institutions and investments.  3. For greater certainty, the treatment to be accorded by a Party under paragraph 1 and paragraph 2 means, with respect to a regional level of government, treatment no less favourable than the most favourable treatment accorded, in like circumstances, by that regional level of government to investors, financial institutions and investments of investors in financial institutions, of the Party of which it forms a part.  4. For the purposes of the national treatment obligations in Article 6.1 (Cross-Border Trade), a Party shall accord to cross-border financial service suppliers of the other Party treatment no less favourable than that it accords to its own financial service suppliers, in like circumstances, with respect to the supply of the relevant service.

Each Party shall accord to:  (a) investors of the other Party, treatment no less favourable than that it accords to investors of a non-Party, in like circumstances;  (b) financial institutions of the other Party, treatment no less favourable than that it accords to financial institutions of a non-Party, in like circumstances;  (c) investments of investors of the other Party in financial institutions, treatment no less favourable than that it accords to investments of investors of a non-Party in financial institutions, in like circumstances; and  (d) cross-border financial service suppliers of the other Party, treatment no less favourable than that it accords to cross-border financial service suppliers of a non-Party, in like circumstances.  2.

ARTICLE 6   Cross-Border Trade  1. Each Party shall permit, under terms and conditions that accord national treatment, cross-border financial service suppliers of the other Party to supply the financial services specified in Annex 9-A (Cross-Border Trade).  2. Each Party shall permit persons located in its territory, and its nationals wherever located, to purchase financial services from cross-border financial service suppliers of the other Party located in the territory of the other Party. This obligation does not require a Party to permit those suppliers to do business or solicit in its territory.                                                  6 Subparagraph (a)(iii) does not cover measures of a Party which limit inputs for the supply of financial services. 9  A Party may define “doing business” and “solicitation” for the purposes of this obligation provided that those definitions are not inconsistent with paragraph 1.  3. Without prejudice to other means of prudential regulation of cross-border trade in financial services, a Party may require the registration or authorisation of cross-border financial service suppliers of the other Party and of financial instruments.   ARTICLE 7  New Financial Services7  Each Party shall permit a financial institution of the other Party to supply a new financial service that the Party would permit its own financial institutions, in like circumstances, to supply without adopting a law or modifying an existing law.8 Notwithstanding Article 5(b) (Market Access for Financial Institutions), a Party may determine the institutional and juridical form through which the new financial service may be supplied and may require authorisation for the supply of the service. If a Party requires a financial institution to obtain authorisation to supply a new financial service, the Party shall decide within a reasonable period of time whether to issue the authorisation and may refuse the authorisation only for prudential reasons.   ARTICLE 8  Treatment of Certain Information  Nothing in this Chapter shall require a Party to furnish or allow access to:  (a) information related to the financial affairs and accounts of individual customers of financial institutions or cross-border financial service suppliers; or  (b) any confidential information, the disclosure of which would impede law enforcement or otherwise be contrary to the public interest or prejudice legitimate commercial interests of particular enterprises.   ARTICLE 9  Senior Management and Boards of Directors                                                   7 The Parties understand that nothing in this Article prevents a financial institution of a Party from applying to the other Party to request that it authorise the supply of a financial service that is not supplied in the territory of either Party. That application shall be subject to the law of the Party to which the application is made and, for greater certainty, shall not be subject to this Article.  8 For greater certainty, a Party may issue a new regulation or other subordinate measure in permitting the supply of the new financial service. 10  1. Neither Party shall require financial institutions of the other Party to engage natural persons of any particular nationality as senior managerial or other essential personnel.  2. Neither Party shall require that more than a minority of the board of directors of a financial institution of the other Party be composed of nationals of the Party, persons residing in the territory of the Party, or a combination thereof.

Articles 3 (National Treatment), 4 (Most-Favoured-Nation Treatment), 5 (Market Access for Financial Institutions), 6 (Cross-Border Trade) and 9 (Senior Management and Boards of Directors) shall not apply to any measure that a Party adopts or maintains with respect to sectors, subsectors or activities, as set out by that Party in Section B of its Schedule to Annex 6.  11  3. A non-conforming measure, set out in a Party’s Schedule to Annex 4-I or 4-II as not subject to Articles 4 (National Treatment) or 5 (Most-Favoured-Nation Treatment) of Chapter 7 (Cross-Border Trade in Services) or Articles 4 (National Treatment), 5 (Most-Favoured-Nation Treatment) or 8 (Senior Management and Boards of Directors) of Chapter 8 (Investment) shall be treated as a non-conforming measure not subject to Articles 3 (National Treatment), 4 (Most-Favoured-Nation Treatment) or 9 (Senior Management and Boards of Directors), as the case may be, to the extent that the measure, sector, subsector or activity set out in the entry is covered by this Chapter.  4. (a) Article 3 (National Treatment) shall not apply to any measure that falls within an exception to, or derogation from, the obligations which are imposed by Article 3 of the TRIPS Agreement.  (b) Article 4 (Most-Favoured-Nation Treatment) shall not apply to any measure that falls within Article 5 of the TRIPS Agreement, or an exception to, or derogation from, the obligations which are imposed by Article 4 of the TRIPS Agreement.   ARTICLE 11  Exceptions  1. Notwithstanding any other provisions of this Chapter and Agreement except for Chapters 2 (Trade in Goods), 3 (Rules of Origin), 4 (Customs Procedures) and 5 (Technical Regulations and Sanitary and Phytosanitary Measures), a Party shall not be prevented from adopting or maintaining measures for prudential reasons,9 including for the protection of investors, depositors, policy holders, or persons to whom a fiduciary duty is owed by a financial institution or cross-border financial service supplier, or to ensure the integrity and stability of the financial system. If these measures do not conform with the provisions of this Agreement to which this exception applies, they shall not be used as a means of avoiding the Party’s commitments or obligations under those provisions.  2. Nothing in this Chapter, Chapters 7 (Cross-Border Trade in Services), 8 (Investment), 10 (Telecommunications Services), or 14 (Electronic Commerce) shall apply to non-discriminatory measures of general application taken by any public entity in pursuit of monetary and related credit policies or exchange rate policies.

Notwithstanding Article 15 (Transfers) of Chapter 8 (Investment) and Article 14 (Payments and Transfers) of Chapter 7 (Cross-Border Trade in Services), as incorporated into this Chapter, a Party may prevent or limit transfers by a financial institution or cross-border financial service supplier to, or for the benefit of, an affiliate of or person related to such institution or supplier, through the equitable, non-discriminatory and good faith application of measures relating to maintenance of the safety, soundness, integrity, or financial responsibility of financial institutions or cross-border financial service suppliers. This paragraph does not prejudice any other provision of this Agreement that permits a Party to restrict transfers.  4. For greater certainty, nothing in this Chapter shall be construed to prevent a Party from adopting or enforcing measures necessary to secure compliance with laws or regulations that are not inconsistent with this Chapter, including those relating to the prevention of deceptive and fraudulent practices or to deal with the effects of a default on financial services contracts, subject to the requirement that such measures are not applied in a manner which would constitute a means of arbitrary or unjustifiable discrimination between Parties or between Parties and non-Parties where like conditions prevail, or a disguised restriction on investment in financial institutions or cross-border trade in financial services as covered by this Chapter.   ARTICLE 12  Recognition  1. A Party may recognise prudential measures of the other Party or a non-Party in the application of measures covered by this Chapter.10 That recognition may be:  (a) accorded autonomously;  (b) achieved through harmonisation or other means; or  (c) based upon an agreement or arrangement with the other Party or a non-Party.  2. A Party that accords recognition of prudential measures under paragraph 1 shall provide adequate opportunity to the other Party to demonstrate that circumstances exist in which there are or would be equivalent regulation, oversight, implementation of regulation and, if appropriate, procedures concerning the sharing of information between the Parties.  3. If a Party accords recognition of prudential measures under paragraph 1(c) and the circumstances set out in paragraph 2 exist, that Party shall provide adequate opportunity to the other Party to negotiate accession to the agreement or arrangement, or to negotiate a comparable agreement or arrangement.                                                    10 For greater certainty, nothing in Article 4 (Most-Favoured-Nation Treatment) shall be construed to require a Party to accord recognition to prudential measures of the other Party. 13  ARTICLE 13  Transparency and Administration of Certain Measures  1. The Parties recognise that transparent regulations and policies governing the activities of financial institutions and cross-border financial service suppliers are important in facilitating their ability to gain access to and operate in each other’s markets. Each Party commits to promote regulatory transparency in financial services.  2. Each Party shall ensure that all measures of general application to which this Chapter applies are administered in a reasonable, objective and impartial manner.  3. Each Party shall, to the extent practicable:  (a) publish in advance any such regulation that it proposes to adopt and the purpose of the regulation; and  (b) provide interested persons and the other Party with a reasonable opportunity to comment on that proposed regulation.  4. At the time that it adopts a final regulation, a Party should, to the extent practicable, address in writing the substantive comments received from interested persons with respect to the proposed regulation.11  5. To the extent practicable, each Party should allow a reasonable period of time between publication of a final regulation of general application and the date when it enters into effect.  6. Each Party shall ensure that the rules of general application adopted or maintained by a self-regulatory organisation of the Party are promptly published or otherwise made available in a manner that enables interested persons to become acquainted with them.  7.

On request of an applicant, a Party’s regulatory authority shall inform the applicant of the status of its application. If the authority requires additional information from the applicant, it shall notify the applicant without undue delay.  10. A Party’s regulatory authority shall make an administrative decision on a complete application of an investor in a financial institution, a financial institution or a                                                  11 For greater certainty, a Party may address those comments collectively on an official government website. 14  cross-border financial service supplier of the other Party relating to the supply of a financial service, within 120 days and shall promptly notify the applicant of the decision. An application shall not be considered complete until all relevant hearings have been held and all necessary information has been received. If it is not practicable for a decision to be made within 120 days, the regulatory authority shall notify the applicant without undue delay and shall endeavour to make the decision within a reasonable period of time thereafter.  11. On request of an unsuccessful applicant, a regulatory authority that has denied an application shall, to the extent practicable, inform the applicant of the reasons for denial of the application.   ARTICLE 14  Self-Regulatory Organisations  If a Party requires a financial institution or a cross-border financial service supplier of the other Party to be a member of, participate in, or have access to, a self-regulatory organisation in order to provide a financial service in or into its territory, it shall ensure that the self-regulatory organisation observes the obligations contained in Articles 3 (National Treatment) and 4 (Most-Favoured-Nation Treatment).   ARTICLE 15  Payment and Clearing Systems  Under terms and conditions that accord national treatment, each Party shall grant financial institutions of the other Party established in its territory access to payment and clearing systems operated by public entities, and to official funding and refinancing facilities available in the normal course of ordinary business. This Article is not intended to confer access to the Party’s lender of last resort facilities.   ARTICLE 16  Expedited Availability of Insurance Services  The Parties recognise the importance of maintaining and developing regulatory procedures to expedite the offering of insurance services by licensed suppliers. These procedures may include: allowing introduction of products unless those products are disapproved within a reasonable period of time; not requiring product approval or authorisation of insurance lines for insurance other than insurance sold to individuals or compulsory insurance; or not imposing limitations on the number or frequency of product introductions. If a Party maintains regulatory product approval procedures, that Party shall endeavour to maintain or improve those procedures.   ARTICLE 17 15   Performance of Back-Office Functions  1. The Parties recognise that the performance of the back-office functions of a financial institution in its territory by the head office or an affiliate of the financial institution, or by an unrelated service supplier, either inside or outside its territory, is important to the effective management and efficient operation of that financial institution. While a Party may require financial institutions to ensure compliance with any domestic requirements applicable to those functions, they recognise the importance of avoiding the imposition of arbitrary requirements on the performance of those functions.  2. For greater certainty, nothing in paragraph 1 prevents a Party from requiring a financial institution in its territory to retain certain functions.   ARTICLE 18  Specific Commitments  Annex 9-B (Specific Commitments) sets out certain specific commitments by each Party.   ARTICLE 19  Committee on Financial Services  1.

Consultations under this Article shall include officials of the authorities specified in Annex 9-C (Authorities Responsible for Financial Services).  3. For greater certainty, nothing in this Article shall be construed to require a Party to derogate from its law regarding sharing of information between financial regulators or the requirements of an agreement or arrangement between financial authorities of the Parties, or to require a regulatory authority to take any action that would interfere with specific regulatory, supervisory, administrative or enforcement matters.   ARTICLE 21  Dispute Settlement  1. Chapter 16 (Dispute Settlement) shall apply as modified by this Article to the settlement of disputes arising under this Chapter.  2.

In addition to the requirements set out in Article 5.5 (Composition of Arbitral Tribunals) of Chapter 16 (Dispute Settlement), arbitrators in disputes arising under this Chapter shall have expertise or experience in financial services law or practice, which may include the regulation of financial institutions.  17  4. Pursuant to Article 22.2(c) (Investment Disputes in Financial Services), a Party may request the establishment of a Chapter 16 arbitral tribunal to consider whether and to what extent Article 11 (Exceptions) is a valid defence to a claim without having to request consultations under Article 2 (Consultations) of Chapter 16 (Dispute Settlement).   5. If a Party seeks to suspend benefits in the financial services sector, a Chapter 16 arbitral tribunal that reconvenes to make a determination on the proposed suspension of benefits, in accordance with Article 10 (Compensation and Suspension of Benefits) of Chapter 16 (Dispute Settlement), shall seek the views of financial services experts, as necessary.
