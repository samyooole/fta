Technical Cooperation and Information Exchange  5.1 The Parties shall exchange information on matters concerning relevant food products, food standards and conformity assessment procedures.  5.2 The Parties shall explore opportunities for joint technical cooperation programmes with a view to developing a joint work programme, consistent with the provisions of Chapter 5 (Technical Regulations and Sanitary and Phytosanitary Measures).  5.3 The Parties shall exchange information on emergency recalls of food products and shall identify in the Schedule contact points for this information.  5.4 The Parties shall establish contact points for the exchange of information, as appropriate, and shall identify in the Schedule contact points for this ANNEX  5A– 4  information, in relation to the following:  (a) development of new food standards;   (b) changes to existing food standards;   (c) food product safety information;  (d) risk assessments of food products; and  (e) any internal guidelines relevant to the determination of equivalence.  5.5 The Parties shall seek to improve communications between them in matters relevant to the development of domestic food standards and the development of international standards and guidelines through the Codex Alimentarius Commission, and the relevant WTO Committees.   6.
