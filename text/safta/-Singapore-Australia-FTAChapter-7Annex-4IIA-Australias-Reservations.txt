INTRODUCTORY NOTES 
 
1.  For the avoidance of doubt, in relation to education services, nothing in Chapter

of equal opportunity for students and recognition of credits and degrees), 
in setting tuition rates and in the development of curricula or course 
content; 
 
(b)  non-discriminatory accreditation and quality assurance procedures for 
education and training institutions and their programmes, including the 
standards that must be met; 
 
(c)  government  funding,  subsidies  or  grants,  such  as  land  grants, 
preferential  tax  treatment  and  other  public  benefits,  provided  to 
education and training institutions; or 
 
(d)  the need for education and training institutions to comply with non-
discriminatory requirements related to the establishment and operation 
of a facility in a particular jurisdiction.

GATS/SC/6/Suppl.1, GATS/SC/6/Suppl.1/Rev.1, GATS/SC/6/Suppl.2,

19 For the purposes of this entry:  
 
“legal advisory services” – includes provision of advice to and consultation with clients in matters, including 
transactions, relationships and disputes, involving the application or interpretation of law; participation with 
or on behalf of clients in negotiations and other dealings with third parties in such matters; and preparation of 
documents governed in whole or in part by law, and the verification of documents of any kind for purposes 
of and in accordance with the requirements of law. Does not include advice, consultation and documentation 
services performed by service suppliers entrusted with public functions, such as notary services, or services 
provided by patent or trade mark attorneys. 
 
“legal representational services” – includes preparation of documents intended to be submitted to courts, 
administrative agencies, and other duly constituted official tribunals in matters involving the application and 
interpretation of law; and appearance before courts, administrative agencies, and other duly constituted 
official tribunals in matters involving the application and interpretation of the specified body of law. (Note: 
The inclusion of representational services before administrative agencies and other duly constituted official 
tribunals within the context of legal services does not necessarily mean that a licensed lawyer must supply 
such services in all cases. The precise scope of services subject to licensing requirements is subject to the 
discretion of the relevant regulatory authority.) Does not include documentation services performed by service 
suppliers entrusted with public functions, such as notary services, or services provided by patent or trade mark 
attorneys. 
 
“legal arbitration, conciliation and mediation services” – preparation of documents to be submitted to, 
preparation for and appearance before, an arbitrator, conciliator or mediator in any dispute involving the 
application and interpretation of law. Does not include arbitration, conciliation and mediation services in 
disputes for which the law has no bearing which fall under services incidental to management consulting. As 
a sub-category, international legal arbitration, conciliation and mediation services refer to the same services 
when the dispute involves parties from two or more countries. 
 
“domestic law (host country law)” – the law of Australia.   
 
“foreign law” – the law of the territories of WTO Members and other countries other than the law of Australia.   
 
“international law” – includes law established by international treaties and conventions, as well as customary 
law.

For the purposes of these definitions: 
 
“arbitration” is taken to mean a process in which the parties to a dispute present arguments and evidence to a 
dispute resolution practitioner (the arbitrator) who makes a determination.  
 
“mediation” is taken to mean a process in which the parties to a dispute, with the assistance of a dispute 
resolution practitioner (the mediator), identify the disputed issues, develop options, consider alternatives and 
endeavour to reach an agreement. The mediator has no advisory or determinative role in regard to the content 
of the dispute or the outcome of its resolution, but may advise on or determine the process of mediation 
whereby resolution is attempted.  
 
“conciliation” is taken to mean a process in which the parties to a dispute, with the assistance of a dispute 
resolution practitioner (the conciliator), identify the issues in dispute, develop options, consider alternatives 
and endeavour to reach an agreement. The conciliator may have an advisory role on the content of the dispute 
or the outcome of its resolution, but not a determinative role. The conciliator may advise on or determine the 
process of conciliation whereby resolution is attempted, and may make suggestions for terms of settlement, 
give expert advice on likely settlement terms, and may actively encourage the participants to reach an 
agreement.

Services”, S/CSS/W/38), but see especially footnote 22 above.
