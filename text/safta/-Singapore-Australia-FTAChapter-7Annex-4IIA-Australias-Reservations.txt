content; 
 
(b) 
non-discriminatory accreditation and quality assurance procedures for 
education and training institutions and their programmes, including the 
standards that must be met;

The inclusion of representational services before administrative agencies and other duly constituted official 
tribunals within the context of legal services does not necessarily mean that a licensed lawyer must supply 
such services in all cases. The precise scope of services subject to licensing requirements is subject to the 
discretion of the relevant regulatory authority.) Does not include documentation services performed by service

For the purposes of these definitions: 
 
“arbitration” is taken to mean a process in which the parties to a dispute present arguments and evidence to a 
dispute resolution practitioner (the arbitrator) who makes a determination.  
 
“mediation” is taken to mean a process in which the parties to a dispute, with the assistance of a dispute 
resolution practitioner (the mediator), identify the disputed issues, develop options, consider alternatives and 
endeavour to reach an agreement. The mediator has no advisory or determinative role in regard to the content 
of the dispute or the outcome of its resolution, but may advise on or determine the process of mediation 
whereby resolution is attempted.  
 
“conciliation” is taken to mean a process in which the parties to a dispute, with the assistance of a dispute 
resolution practitioner (the conciliator), identify the issues in dispute, develop options, consider alternatives 
and endeavour to reach an agreement. The conciliator may have an advisory role on the content of the dispute 
or the outcome of its resolution, but not a determinative role. The conciliator may advise on or determine the 
process of conciliation whereby resolution is attempted, and may make suggestions for terms of settlement, 
give expert advice on likely settlement terms, and may actively encourage the participants to reach an
