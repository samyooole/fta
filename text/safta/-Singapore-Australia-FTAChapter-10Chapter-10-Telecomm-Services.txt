The Parties recognise that a Party, when it has the authority to do so, may choose to adopt or maintain measures affecting rates for wholesale international roaming services with a view to ensuring that those rates are reasonable. If a Party considers it appropriate, it may cooperate and implement mechanisms with the other Party to facilitate the implementation of those measures, including by entering into arrangements with the other Party.   4. If a Party (the first Party) chooses to regulate rates or conditions for wholesale international mobile roaming services, it shall ensure that a supplier of public telecommunications services of the other Party (the second Party) has access to the regulated rates or conditions for wholesale international mobile roaming services for its customers roaming in the territory of the first Party in circumstances in which:10  (a) the second Party has entered into an arrangement with the first Party to reciprocally regulate rates or conditions for wholesale international mobile roaming services for suppliers of both Parties;11 or                                                    10 For greater certainty, neither Party shall, solely on the basis of any obligations owed to it by the first Party under a most-favoured-nation provision, or under a telecommunications-specific non-discrimination provision, in any existing international trade agreement, seek or obtain for its suppliers the access to regulated rates or conditions for wholesale international mobile roaming services that is provided under this Article.  11 For greater certainty, access under this subparagraph to the rates or conditions regulated by the first Party shall be available to a supplier of the second Party only if such regulated rates or conditions are reasonably comparable to those reciprocally regulated under the arrangement referred to in this subparagraph. The telecommunications regulatory body of the first Party shall, in the case of disagreement, determine whether the rates or conditions are reasonably comparable.    16  (b) in the absence of an arrangement of the type referred to in subparagraph (a), the supplier of public telecommunications services of the second Party, of its own accord:   (i) makes available to suppliers of public telecommunications services of the first Party wholesale international mobile roaming services at rates or conditions that are reasonably comparable to the regulated rates or conditions;12 and   (ii) meets any additional requirements13 that the first Party imposes with respect to the availability of the regulated rates or conditions.   The first Party may require suppliers of the second Party to fully utilise commercial negotiations to reach agreement on the terms for accessing such rates or conditions.   5. A Party that ensures access to regulated rates or conditions for wholesale international mobile roaming services in accordance with paragraph 4 shall be deemed to be in compliance with its obligations under Article 5 (Most-Favoured-Nation Treatment) of Chapter 7 (Cross-Border Trade in Services), and Articles 3 (Access to and Use of Public Telecommunications Networks or Services) and 9.1 (Additional Obligations Relating to Major Suppliers – Non-Discrimination) with respect to international mobile roaming services.   6. Each Party shall endeavour to ensure that:  (a) suppliers of public telecommunications services in its territory; or  (b) its telecommunications regulatory body   make publicly available retail rates for international mobile roaming services.   7. Nothing in this Article shall require a Party to regulate rates or conditions for international mobile roaming services.   ARTICLE 12  International Submarine Cable Systems  1. This article applies to international submarine cable systems where, under national law and regulation, a Party has authorised a supplier of public                                                  12 For the purposes of this subparagraph, rates or conditions that are reasonably comparable means rates or conditions agreed to be such by the relevant suppliers or, in the case of disagreement, determined to be such by the telecommunications regulatory body of the first Party.  13 For greater certainty, such additional requirements may include, for example, that the rates provided to the supplier of the second Party reflect the reasonable cost of supplying international mobile roaming services by a supplier of the first Party to a supplier of the second Party, as determined through the methodology of the first Party. 17  telecommunications services in its territory to operate a submarine cable system as a public telecommunications service.   2. Where submarine cable systems cannot be economically or technically substituted, each Party shall provide its telecommunications regulatory body with the authority to:  (a) subject to technical feasibility and pre-existing contractual commitments, require a major supplier of public telecommunications services to allow suppliers of public telecommunications services of the other Party to:  (i) access the submarine cable landing station for the purpose of interconnection with the submarine cables owned by any supplier of telecommunications;  (ii) co-locate their transmission and routing equipment at the submarine cable landing station;   (iii) connect their equipment to submarine cable capacity, including by accessing the supplier’s cross-connect links; and  (iv) access ancillary services; and  (b) ensure that the terms, conditions and rates for the services referred to in subparagraph (a) as supplied by a major supplier are reasonable and non-discriminatory.  3. For greater certainty, co-location should be consistent with Article 9.4 (Additional Obligations Relating to Major Suppliers – Co-Location) and interconnection should be consistent with Article 9.7 (Additional Obligations Relating to Major Suppliers – Interconnection with a Major Supplier).   ARTICLE 13  Universal Service  Each Party has the right to define the kind of universal service obligation it wishes to maintain. Each Party shall administer any universal service obligation that it maintains in a transparent, non-discriminatory and competitively neutral manner, and shall ensure that its universal service obligation is not more burdensome than necessary for the kind of universal service that it has defined.       18  ARTICLE 14  Allocation and Use of Scarce Resources14  Any procedures for the allocation and use of scarce resources, including frequencies, numbers and rights of way, shall be carried out in an objective, timely, transparent and non-discriminatory manner. The current state of allocated frequency bands shall be made publicly available, but detailed identification of frequencies allocated for specific government use shall not be required.   ARTICLE 15  Flexibility in the Choice of Technology  1. Neither Party shall prevent suppliers of public telecommunications services from choosing the technologies they wish to use to supply their services, subject to requirements necessary to satisfy legitimate public policy interests, provided that any measure restricting that choice is not prepared, adopted or applied in a manner that creates unnecessary obstacles to trade. For greater certainty, a Party adopting those measures shall do so consistent with Article 4 (Transparency).   2. When a Party finances the development of advanced networks,15 it may make its financing conditional on the use of technologies that meet its specific public policy interests.   ARTICLE 16  Industry Participation  1. Each Party shall, through any forum or other mechanism it considers appropriate:  (a) facilitate the involvement of suppliers of public telecommunications networks or services of the other Party operating in its territory in the development of industry standards and, where it considers appropriate, in the regulation of the telecommunications industry; and                                                     14 Decisions on the allocation and assignment of spectrum and frequency management are not measures that are per se inconsistent with Article 3 (Market Access) of Chapter 7 (Cross-Border Trade in Services). Accordingly, each Party retains the ability to exercise its spectrum and frequency management policies, which may affect the number of service suppliers, provided that this is done in a manner that is consistent with this Agreement. The Parties also retain the right to allocate frequency bands taking into account existing and future needs.  15 For greater certainty, “advanced networks” includes broadband networks.   19  (b) encourage suppliers of public telecommunications networks or services of the other Party operating in its territory to provide feedback to the telecommunications regulatory body on the regulation of the telecommunications industry.   ARTICLE 17  Enforcement  Each Party shall adopt or maintain timely, proportionate and effective sanctions for the purpose of enforcing domestic measures relating to the obligations contained in this Chapter. Such sanctions may include financial penalties, injunctions, orders to cease and desist (on an interim or final basis), and/or the ability to suspend, modify or revoke licences.   ARTICLE 18  Exceptions  This Chapter shall be subject to Article 16 (General Exceptions) of Chapter 7 (Cross-Border Trade in Services) and Article 19 (General Exceptions) of Chapter 8 (Investment), and to Article 2 (Security Exceptions) of Chapter 17 (Final Provisions).
