permitted areas of legal practice required of the 3 Australian 
lawyers referred to in subparagraph (i) shall be considered on

rather than on the basis of 5 years for each Australian lawyer; 
and 
 
In relation to Rule 5(1)(g) of the Legal Profession (Regulated 
Individuals) Rules 2015: 
 
(iii) the minimum relevant legal expertise and experience in the
