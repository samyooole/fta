Republic ("Lao PDR"), Malaysia, the Union of Myanmar, the Republic of
the Philippines, the Republic of Singapore, the Kingdom of Thailand and
the Socialist Republic of Viet Nam, Member States of the Association of
South East Asian Nations (collectively, "ASEAN" or "ASEAN Member
States", or individually, "ASEAN Member State"), and Japan gathered
today for the ASEAN-Japan Summit;
RECALLING the Joint Declaration made at the ASEAN-Japan Summit
held on 5 November 2002 in Phnom Penh, Cambodia to implement
measures for the realisation of a Comprehensive Economic Partnership
("CEP"), including elements of a possible Free Trade Area ("FTA") which
should be completed as soon as possible within 10 years, and to establish a
Committee to consider and draft a framework for the realisation of the CEP
between ASEAN and Japan ("ASEAN-Japan CEP");
INSPIRED by the significant progress made in ASEAN-Japan relations
which has spanned 30 years of an economic partnership that has been
expanding over a wide range of areas;
DESIRING to minimise barriers and deepen economic linkages between
ASEAN and Japan; lower business costs; increase intra-regional trade and
investment; increase economic efficiency; create a larger market with
greater opportunities and larger economies of scale for the businesses of
both ASEAN and Japan; and enhance our attractiveness to capital and
talent;
SHARING the view that the ASEAN-Japan CEP should benefit from, and
should be complementary to the economic integration of ASEAN, and
considering that achievement of the ASEAN Free Trade Area ("AFTA")
will enhance the value of ASEAN as a regional market and attract
investment to ASEAN and that it is desirable that the Common Effective
Preferential Tariff ("CEPT") Scheme among ASEAN Member States be
implemented on a timely basis;
BEING confident that the establishment of an ASEAN-Japan FTA
covering trade in goods, services and investment will create a partnership
between ASEAN and Japan, and provide an important mechanism for
strengthening co-operation and supporting economic stability in East
Asia;
RECOGNISING the important role and contribution of the business
sector in enhancing trade and investment between ASEAN and Japan and
the need to further promote and facilitate their co-operation and
utilisation of greater business opportunities provided by the ASEAN-
Japan CEP;

ASEAN Member States and between ASEAN and Japan, and the need to
facilitate the increasing participation of the Kingdom of Cambodia, Lao
PDR, the Union of Myanmar and the Socialist Republic of Viet Narn,
(collectively, "the newer ASEAN Member States") in the ASEAN-Japan
CEP;
REAFFIRMING the rights and obligations of the respective countries
under the Marrakesh Agreement Establishing the World Trade
Organization ("WTO Agreement"), and other multilateral, regional and
bilateral agreements and arrangements;
RECOGNISING the catalytic role that regional trade arrangements can
contribute towards accelerating regional and global liberalisation and as
building blocks in the framework of the multilateral trading system;

General Exceptions
