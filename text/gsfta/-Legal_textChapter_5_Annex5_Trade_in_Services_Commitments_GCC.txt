ANNEX A 
 
REFERENCE PAPER 
 
Scope 
 
The following are definitions and principles on the regulatory framework for the basic 
telecommunications services.  
 
Definitions 
 
 
Essential facilities means facilities of a public telecommunications transport network 
or service that: 
 
(a)   are  exclusively  or  predominantly  provided  by  a  single  or  limited 
number of suppliers; and  
 
(b)   cannot feasibly be economically or technically substituted in order to 
provide a service.  
 
Major supplier is a supplier who has the ability to materially affect the terms of 
participation (having regard to price and supply) in the relevant market for basic   
telecommunications services as a result of: 
 
(a)    control over essential facilities; or 
 
(b)   use of its position in the market.  
 
User means service consumers and service suppliers. 
 
 
1.    Competitive safeguards 
 
1.1   Prevention of anti-competitive practices in the telecommunications sector 
 
Appropriate  measures  shall  be  maintained  for  the  purpose  of  preventing 
suppliers who, alone or together, are a major supplier from engaging in or 
continuing anti-competitive practices.  
 
1.2   Safeguards 
 
The anti-competitive practices referred to above shall include, in particular:  
 
(a)   engaging in anti-competitive cross-subsidisation; 
 
(b)   using information obtained from competitors, with anti-competitive 
results; and  
 
    115        
 
(c)    not making available to other services suppliers on a timely basis, 
technical  information  about  essential  facilities  and  commercially 
relevant information which are necessary for them to provide services.  
 
2.  Interconnection  
 
2.1  This  section  applies  to  linking  with  suppliers  providing  public 
telecommunications transport networks or services in order to allow the users 
of one supplier to communicate with users of another supplier and to access 
services  provided  by  another  supplier,  where  specific  commitments  are 
undertaken.   
 
 
2.2  Interconnection to be ensured  
 
Interconnection  with  a  major  supplier  will  be  ensured  at  any  technically 
feasible point in the work. Such interconnection is provided:  
 
 
(a)   under  non-discriminatory  terms,  conditions  (including  technical 
standards  and  specifications)  and  rates  and  of  a  quality  no  less 
favourable than that provided for its own like services or for like 
services of non-affiliated service suppliers or for its subsidiaries or 
other affiliates; 
 
 
(b)   in a timely fashion, on terms, conditions (including technical standards 
and  specifications)  and  cost-oriented  rates  that  are  transparent, 
reasonable,  having  regard  to  economic  feasibility,  and  sufficiently 
unbundled so that the supplier need not pay for network components or 
facilities that it does not require for the service to be provided; and 
 
(c)   upon request, at points in addition to the network termination points 
offered to the majority of users, subject to charges that reflect the cost 
of construction of necessary additional facilities.  
 
2.3  Public availability of the procedures for interconnection negotiations 
 
The procedures applicable for interconnection to a major supplier will be made 
publicly available.  
 
 
2.4  Transparency of interconnection arrangements  
 
 A major supplier  shall make publicly available either its interconnection 
agreements or a reference interconnection offer.   
 
 
2.5  Interconnection: Dispute Settlement 
 
    116        
 
A service supplier requesting interconnection with a major supplier will have 
recourse, either:  
 
   (a)   at any time; or  
 
(b)   after a reasonable period of time which has been made publicly known 
to an independent domestic body, which may be a regulatory body as 
referred  to  in  paragraph  5  below,  to  resolve  disputes  regarding 
appropriate terms, conditions and rates for interconnection within a 
reasonable  period  of  time,  to  the  extent  that  these  have  not  been 
established previously.   
 
3.    Universal Service  
   
Each Party has the right to define the kind of universal service obligation it 
wishes to maintain. Such obligations will not be regarded as anti-competitive 
per se, provided they are administered in a transport, non-discriminatory and 
competitively neutral manner and are not more burdensome than necessary for 
the kind of universal service defined by that Party.  
 
4.    Public availability of licensing criteria  
 
Where a licence is required, the following will be made publicly available:  
 
(a)   all the licensing criteria and the period of time normally required to 
reach a decision concerning an application for a licence; and  
  
(b)   the terms and conditions of individual licences.  
 
The reasons for the denial of a licence will be known to the applicant upon 
request.  
 
5.    Independent regulations  
 
The regulatory body is separate from, and not accountable to, any supplier of 
basic telecommunications services. The decisions of, and the procedures used 
by, regulators shall be impartial with respect to all market participants.   
 
6.  Allocations and use of scarce resources  
 
Any  procedures  for  the  allocation  and  use  of scarce  resources,  including 
frequencies, numbers and rights of way, will be carried out in an objective, 
timely,  transparent  and  non-discriminatory  manner.  The  current  state  of 
allocated  frequency  bands  will  be  made  publicly  available,  but  detailed 
identification of frequencies allocated for specific government uses is not 
required.
