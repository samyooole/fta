H.E. Lim Hng Kiang
Minister for Trade and Industry
The Republic of Singapore
Dear Excellency,
I have the honour to refer to the Free Trade Agreement between the Cooperation 
Council for the Arab States of the Gulf and the Republic of Singapore signed at 
Doha, Qatar on 15 December 2008 (“the Agreement”).
During the negotiations of the Agreement, the Parties reached the following 
understanding as set out in Article 8.5 of Chapter 8 on Cooperation:
“Within one year of the entry into force of this Agreement, the Parties 
will negotiate and make arrangements to provide for recognition by 
the GCC Member States of Singapore’s Halal Certification Standards 
and Halal Mark.”
Notwithstanding the above understanding, the United Arab Emirates confirms that 
it shall recognise the Halal Certification Standards and Halal Mark of the Republic 
of Singapore as being equivalent to its own Halal Certification Standards and 
Halal Mark, provided that the Republic of Singapore objectively demonstrates to 
the United Arab Emirates that its Halal Certification Standards and Halal Mark 
satisfies the requirements as those of the United Arab Emirates.
I have the honour to confirm that this letter, together with your reply confirming 
this understanding, shall constitute an agreement between the Parties, and that this 
agreement shall, pursuant to Article 10.1 of the Agreement, form an integral part 
of the Agreement as from the date of your reply.
Yours sincerely,
ABDULRAHMAN HAMAD AL-ATTIYAH
Secretary-General of the Cooperation 
Council for the Arab States of the Gulf
