Dear Excellency,
I have the honour to confirm the following with regard to the Denial of Benefits 
provision set out in Article 5.16 of the Free Trade Agreement between the 
Cooperation Council for the Arab States of the Gulf and the Republic of Singapore 
(hereinafter referred to as “the Agreement”) signed between the Governments of 
the United Arab Emirates, the Kingdom of Bahrain, the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, 
the Sultanate of Oman, the State of Qatar and the State of Kuwait, that are parties 
to the Charter of the Cooperation Council for the Arab States of the Gulf 
(collectively referred to as “the GCC States”, or individually as “a GCC State”), 
and the Government of the Republic of Singapore (“Singapore”).   
The GCC States hereby confirm that any trade and/or economic sanctions imposed 
by the GCC States, or a GCC State, against any foreign country or some foreign 
countries, does not impinge on Singapore’s sovereign right to conduct its foreign 
policy, nor does it prohibit companies of foreign countries that are subject to such 
sanctions imposed by the GCC States, or a GCC State, from establishing 
themselves in Singapore.
The following government agencies in the GCC administer the principal trade and 
economic sanctions: in the case of Bahrain, Ministry of Finance; in the case of 
Kuwait, Ministry of Finance, Negotiation Department; in the case of Oman, 
Ministry of National Economy; in the case of Qatar, Ministry of Foreign Affairs; 
in the case of Saudi Arabia, Ministry of Commerce and Industry; and in the case 
of the UAE, Ministry of Foreign Trade.  The GCC States shall inform Singapore 
of changes or additions to the aforementioned agencies that administer the 
principal trade and economic sanctions.
Paragraph 5(a)  of  Article 1.11 (Joint  Committee)  in  Chapter  1 (General 
Provisions) of the Agreement provides that either Party may request consultations 
with respect to any matter that it considers might affect the operation of the 
Agreement, including how the trade and economic sanctions of the other Party 
might affect the operation of the Agreement.     
The GCC, through this letter, seeks to provide the assurances that Singapore has 
sought with regard to the Agreement’s Denial of Benefits provision. 
Yours Sincerely,
