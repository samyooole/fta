MOVEMENT OF BUSINESS PERSONS  
 
 
Article 1: Scope  
 
This Annex applies to measures affecting the movement of natural persons of  
a Party who enter the territory of the other Party for business purposes.  
 
 
Article 2: Definitions  
 
For the purposes of this Annex, the fol owing definitions shal  apply:  
   
1.   immigration    formality    means   a    visa,    employment    pass (in  the  
case  of  Singapore),    working  permit  (in  the  case  of  Panama)  or    other  
document  or  electronic authorisation  granting  a  natural  person  of  one  Party  
the right to reside or work in the territory of the other Party;   
   
2.   intra-corporate transferee means an employee of a service supplier,  
enterprise  of  a  Party  or  an  investor  of  a  Party  as defined  in  Chapter  9  
(Investment),  who  has  been  so  employed  for  a  period of  not  less  than  one   
year    immediately  preceding  the date  of  the  application for  temporary  entry,  
and who is:   
 
(a)   a  manager,  meaning  a  business person  within  an  organisation  
who primarily directs the organisation or a department  or sub- 
division of the organisation, supervises and controls the work of  
other  supervisory,  professional  or  managerial  employees,  has  
the  authority  to  hire  and  fire  or    take    other  personnel  actions  
(such  as promotion  or  leave  authorisation),  and  exercises  
discretionary    authority  over  day-to-day  operations.    This does  
not  include  a  first-line  supervisor,  unless the  employees  
supervised are professionals, nor does this include an employee  
who primarily performs tasks necessary for the provision of the  
service or operation of an investment;   
 
(b)   an executive meaning a business person within an organisation  
who  primarily  directs the  management  of  the  organisation,  
exercises wide  latitude    in  decision-making,  and  receives only  
general  supervision  or  direction  from  higher    level  executives,   
the  board    of  directors,    or  stockholders of  the  business.    An  
executive would not directly perform tasks related to the actual  
provision of the service or the operation of an investment; or   
 
(c)   a  specialist  meaning  a  business  person  within  an  organisation  
who  possesses  knowledge  at  an  advanced    level  of  expertise  
and who possesses proprietary knowledge of the organisationâ€™s  
service,  research  equipment,  techniques,  or  management  (a  
 
 
 
10A - 1    
   
   
 
specialist  may    include,  but  is not  limited  to,  members of  a  
 
  licensed profession);   
   
3.   temporary entry means entry by an intra-corporate  transferee, as the  
case  may  be, without the intent to establish permanent residence and for the  
purpose of engaging  in activities which are clearly related to their respective  
business purposes.    
 
 
Article 3: Intra-Corporate Transferees  
 
A  Party  shal   grant  temporary  entry  to  an  intra-corporate  transferee  of  the  
other  Party  who  otherwise  meets its criteria  for  the  grant  of  an  immigration  
formality unless there has been a breach of any of the conditions governing  
temporary entry, or an application for an extension of an immigration formality  
has been refused on such grounds of national security or public order by the  
granting Party as it deems fit:   
 
(a)   in the case of Singapore, for an initial period of up to two years 
which may be extended for periods of up to three years at a time  
for a total term not exceeding 8 years; and   
 
(b)   in  the  case  of  Panama,  for  an  initial  period  of  up  to  two  years 
which may be extended for periods of up to three years at a time  
for a total term not exceeding 8 years.   
 
 
Article 4: Provision of Information  
 
A Party shal :   
 
(a)   publish  or  otherwise  make  available  to  the  other  Party  such  
information as wil  enable the other Party to become acquainted  
with its measures relating to this Annex; and     
 
(b)   no  later  than  six  months  after  the  date  of  entry  into  force   
of  this Agreement, prepare, publish or otherwise make available   
in    its own  territory,  and    in  the  territory  of  the  other    Party,   
explanatory  material  regarding  the requirements for temporary  
entry under this Annex in such a manner as wil  enable business  
persons of the other Party to become acquainted with them.   
 
 
Article 5: Dispute Settlement  
   
1.   A  Party  may  not  initiate  proceedings under  Chapter  15  (Dispute  
Settlement)  regarding  a  refusal  to  grant  temporary  entry  under  this Annex  
unless:   
 
(a)   the matter involves a pattern of practice; and   
 
 
10A - 2    
   
   
   
 
  (b)   its natural  persons  affected  have  exhausted  the  available  
 
domestic administrative  remedies regarding  the  particular  
 
matter.   
 
   
2.   The  remedies referred  to  in  paragraph  1(b)  shal   be  deemed  to  be  
exhausted  if  a  final  determination  in  the  matter  has not  been  issued  by  the  
competent  authority  within  one  year  of  the  institution  of  proceedings for  
domestic administrative  remedies,  including  proceedings by  way  of  review,  
and the failure to issue a determination is not attributable to delays caused by  
the natural person.   
 
 
Article 6: Expeditious Application Procedures  
 
A  Party  shal   process  expeditiously  applications for  immigration  formalities  
from  natural  persons  of  the  other  Party,  including  further  immigration   
formality  requests or  extensions thereof,  particularly  applications from  
members of  professions for  which  mutual  recognition  arrangements have  
been concluded.   
 
 
Article 7: Notification of Outcome of Application  
 
A  Party  shal   notify  the  applicants for  temporary  entry,  either  directly  or  
through  their  prospective  employers,  of  the  outcome  of  their  applications,  
including the period of stay and other conditions.   
 
 
Article 8: Online Lodgement and Processing   
 
Where  possible,  after  the  date  of  entry  into  force  of  this Agreement,  the  
Parties shal  provide facilities for online lodgement and processing:    
 
(a)   in the case of Singapore, of employment passes which shal  be  
applied for by the prospective employers; and   
 
(b)   in  the  case  of  Panama,  of  working  permits which  shal   be  
applied for by the prospective employers.    
 
 
Article 9: Resolution of Problems  
 
The relevant authorities of both Parties shal  endeavour to favourably resolve  
any specific or general problems (within the framework of their domestic laws,  
regulations and  other  similar  measures governing  the  temporary  entry  of  
natural persons), which may arise from the implementation and administration  
of this Annex.   
 
 
 
 
 
10A - 3  
 
 
Article 10: Labour Market Testing    
 
Neither  Party  shal   require  labour market  testing,  labour  certification  tests or  
other procedures of similar effect as a condition for temporary entry in respect  
of natural persons on whom the benefits of this Annex are conferred.
