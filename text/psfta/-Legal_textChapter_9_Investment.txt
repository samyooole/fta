This Chapter shal  not apply to measures adopted or maintained by a  Party to the extent that they are covered by Chapter 11 (Financial Services).   5.         The requirement by a Party that a service provider of the other Party  post  a  bond  or  other  form  of  financial  security  as a  condition  of  providing  a  service into its territory does not of itself make this Chapter applicable to the  provision  of  that  cross-border  service.

This Chapter  does  not  apply  to  claims arising  out  of  events which  occurred, or claims which had been raised, prior to the entry into force of this  Agreement.

Article 9.4: Most-Favoured Nation Treatment   1.

Each Party shal  accord to investments of investors of the other Party  treatment  no  less favourable  than  that  it  accords,  in  like  circumstances,  to  investments  in  its territory  of  investors of  any  non-Party  with  respect  to  the    9 - 3     establishment, acquisition, expansion, management, conduct, operation, and  sale or other disposition of investments.

The concepts of "fair and equitable treatment" and "ful  protection and  security" in paragraph 1 do not require treatment in addition to or beyond that  which  is required  by  the  customary  international  law  minimum  standard  of  treatment  of  aliens and  do  not  create  additional  substantive  rights.  The  obligation to provide:   (a)  “fair and equitable treatment” includes the obligation not to deny  justice  in  criminal,  civil  or  administrative  adjudicatory  proceedings; and   (b)  “ful  protection  and  security”  requires each Party  to provide  the  level of police protection required under customary international  law.   3.   A  determination  that  there  has been a  breach  of  another  provision  of  this Agreement, or of a separate international agreement, does not establish  that there has been a breach of this Article.   4.   Without prejudice to paragraph 1, each Party shal  accord to investors  of  the  other  Party,  and  to  investments of  investors of  the  other  Party,  non- discriminatory  treatment  with  respect  to  measures  it  adopts or  maintains  relating  to  losses suffered  by  investments  in  its  territory  owing  to  armed  conflict or civil strife.    5.   Paragraph 4 does not apply to existing measures relating to subsidies  or grants, or to any conditions attached to the receipt or continued receipt of  such subsidies or grants, whether or not such subsidies or grants are offered  exclusively to investors of the Party or investments of investors of the Party,  that  would  be  inconsistent  with  Articles 9.3  and  Article  9.4  but  for  Article  9.10.4.         6  Customary  international  law  results  from  a  general  and  consistent  practice  of  States  that  they  follow  from  a  sense  of  legal  obligation.    With  regards  to  this  article,  the  customary  international law minimum standard of treatment of aliens refers to al  customary international  law principles that protect the economic rights and interests of aliens.      9 - 4     Article 9.6:  Performance Requirements    1.

(b)  The provisions of paragraph 1(f) do not apply:   (i)   when  a  party  authorizes use  of  an  intel ectual  property  right  in  accordance  with  Article  31  of  the  TRIPS  Agreement,  or  to  measures requiring  the  disclosure  of  proprietary  information  that  fal   within  the  scope  of,  and  are consistent with Article 39 of the TRIPS Agreement; or    (i )   when  the  requirement  is imposed  or  the  commitment  or  undertaking is enforced by a court, administrative tribunal  or competition authority to remedy a practice determined  after  judicial  or  administrative  process  to  be  anti- competitive under the Party’s competition laws.

Where a disputing Party asserts as a defence that the measure al eged  to be a breach is within the scope of a non-conforming measure as set out in  its Annexes I  (Non-Conforming  Measures)  and  II  (Non-Conforming  Measures), the Tribunal shal , on the request of the disputing Party, request  the  interpretation  of  the  Administrative  Commission  of  the  Agreement  established in Article 17.1 (Administrative  Commission  of the  Agreement) on  the  issue.  The  Administrative  Commission  shal   issue  in  writing,  its  interpretation  on  the  issue  within  60  days after  the  date  of  receipt  of  the  request. An interpretation issued by the Administrative Commission under this  paragraph shal  be binding on the Tribunal and an award by the Tribunal must  be consistent with that interpretation. If the Administrative Commission fails to  submit an interpretation within 60 days, the Tribunal shal  decide the issue.                                                    9 - 12    ANNEX 9A  EXPROPRIATION    The Parties confirm their shared understanding that:   1.   Article  9.7.1  is intended  to  reflect  customary  international  law  concerning the obligation of States with respect to expropriation.   2.   An  action  or  a  series of  actions by  a  Party  cannot  constitute  an  expropriation unless it interferes with a tangible or intangible property right or  property interest in an investment.    3.   Article  9.7.1  addresses 2  situations.  The  first  is direct  expropriation,  where an investment is nationalized or otherwise directly expropriated through  the formal transfer of title or outright seizure.   4.   The  second  situation  addressed  by  Article  9.7.1  is indirect  expropriation,  where  an  action  or  series of  actions by  a  Party  has an  effect  equivalent  to  direct  expropriation  without  formal  transfer  of  title  or  outright  seizure.   (a)  The  determination  of  whether  an  action  or  series actions by  a  Party,  in  a  specific  fact  situation,  constitutes a  measure  equivalent  to expropriation  requires a  case-by-case, fact-based  inquiry that considers, among other factors:   (i)   the economic impact of the government action, although  the fact that an action or series of actions by a Party has  an  adverse  effect  on  the  economic value  of  an  investment,  standing  alone,  does not  establish  that  a  measure equivalent to expropriation has occurred;   (i )  the extent to which the government action interferes with  distinct, reasonable investment-backed expectations; and   (i i)  the character of the government action.   (b)  Except  in  rare  circumstances,  non-discriminatory  regulatory  actions by  a  Party that  are  designed  and  applied  to  protect  legitimate public welfare objectives, such as public health, safety  and the environment, do not constitute indirect expropriations.              9A - 1
