The Honorable 
Ms. Carmen Gisela Vergara 
Vice-Minister of Foreign Trade 
Ministry of Trade and Industry 
Republic of Panama 
 
 
I have the honor to confirm the following understanding reached between the 
delegations of the Republic of Panama and the Republic of Singapore in the 
course of negotiating of the Chapter 4 (Customs Procedures) of the Free 
Trade  Agreement  between  our  Governments  signed  on  1  March  2006  at 
Singapore (hereinafter referred to as the “Agreement”): 
 
 
“Each Party recognizes the importance of their economies as 
trans-shipment  centres  with  port  and  logistics  facilities  that 
trigger the growth and development of their respective societies.   
 
The Parties agree that a good from a non-Party that qualifies as 
an originating good under a free trade agreement entered into 
by any of the Parties and that non-Party will not lose its status 
as an originating good under that free trade agreement if the 
good  does  not  undergo  any  process  or  operation  other  than 
loading,  reloading,  repackaging,  storage,  transshipment  or  a 
combination  of  the  foregoing  activities  while  it  is  transported 
through the territory of either Party.  
 
If Panama and another government or customs territory sign a 
free trade agreement that contains provisions addressing the 
wholesale purchase or sale of a good within Panama’s ports or 
free trade zones, the Parties shall enter into consultations after 
that agreement enters into force, with a view to considering the 
possible  incorporation  of  such  provisions  in  this  Agreement1. 
The  venue  and  date  of  such  consultations  shall  be  mutually 
agreed by the Parties. 
 
 
I  have  the  honor  to  propose  that  this  letter,  together  with  your  letter  of 
confirmation,  shall  constitute  an  agreement  between  the  Parties  which 
                                                 
1    Such  consultations  shall  be  initiated  through  the  Administrative  Commission  of  the 
Agreement established under Chapter 17 of the Agreement.   
constitutes an integral part of the Agreement and shall take effect on the date 
that the Agreement enters into force.  
 
Sincerely,
