The Honorable 
Ms. Carmen Gisela Vergara 
Vice-Minister of Foreign Trade 
Ministry of Trade and Industries  
Republic of Panama 
 
 
I have the honor to refer to the Panama-Singapore Free Trade Agreement 
signed  on  1  March  2006  at  Singapore  (hereafter  referred  to  as  the 
“Agreement”). During the negotiations of Chapter 2 (Trade in Goods) of the 
Agreement, the delegations of Singapore and Panama reached the following 
understanding: 
 
“In the event that Panama, after the entry into force of the Agreement, 
grants to any non-Party in any bilateral or multilateral trade agreement, 
the elimination of its custom duties for tariff line HS 2203.00.10 (Beer) 
with CIF value of US$0.76 or more by litre in less than five equal 
annual stages, Panama shall immediately and unconditionally grant 
the same tariff treatment to Singapore with respect to said tariff line.” 
 
I  have  the  honor  to  propose  that  this  letter,  together  with  your  letter  of 
confirmation,  shall  constitute  an  agreement  between  the  Parties  which 
constitutes an integral part of the Agreement and shall take effect on the date 
that the Agreement enters into force. 
 
 
Sincerely,
