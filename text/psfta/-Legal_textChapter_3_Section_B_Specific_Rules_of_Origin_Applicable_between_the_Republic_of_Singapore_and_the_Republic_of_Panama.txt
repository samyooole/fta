1. Standard Materials: Standard materials, including standard solutions, are preparations suitable for 
analytical, calibrating or referencing uses having precise degrees of purity or proportions, which are 
certified by the manufacturer. The production of standard materials is to be considered as origin

2. Isomer Separation: The isolation or separation of isomers from a mixture of isomers is to be 
considered to as origin conferring. 
 
3. Chemical Reaction: Any good that is a product of a chemical reaction shall be considered to be an 
originating good if the chemical reaction occurred in the territory of the Parties. A “chemical reaction” 
is a process including a biochemical process, which results in a molecule with a new structure by 
breaking intramolecular bonds and by forming new intramolecular bonds, or by altering the spatial 
arrangement of atoms in a molecule. The following are not considered to be chemical reactions for 
the purposes of this definition:
