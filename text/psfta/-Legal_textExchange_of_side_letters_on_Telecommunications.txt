The Honorable 
Mr. Chan Soo Sen 
Minister of State 
for Trade and Industry and Education 
Republic of Singapore 
 
 
I have the honor to refer to the Panama-Singapore Free Trade Agreement 
signed  on  1  March  2006  at  Singapore  (hereafter  referred  to  as  the 
“Agreement”). During the negotiations of Chapter 12 (Telecommunications) of 
the  Agreement,  the  delegations  of  Singapore  and  Panama  reached  the 
following understanding: 
 
“The Parties agree that an “enterprise of a Party” as defined in Article 
1.3.4 (Definitions of General Application) will not be precluded from 
being  granted  a  concession  to  provide  public  telecommunications 
services.  
 
In  that  regard,  the  Parties  agree  that  any  enterprise  in  which  the 
government of one Party (the “Interested Party”) has a shareholding, 
will not be precluded from applying for a concession to provide public 
telecommunications  services  in  the  other  Party,  as  public 
telecommunications services are defined under the applicable law of 
the other Party, solely by reason of the government of the Interested 
Party having a shareholding in that enterprise.   
 
Accordingly, any enterprise in which the Government of Singapore has 
shareholding (an “Enterprise of Singapore”) and that has been granted 
a  concession  to  provide  one  or  more  public  telecommunications 
services  in  Panama  shall  comply  with  and  be  subject  to  the 
Constitution,  laws,  regulations,  administrative  rulings  and  other 
regulations applicable in Panama.  
 
For greater certainty, nothing in this Agreement shall be construed so 
as to grant any preference or privilege to an Enterprise of Singapore 
that  is  not  otherwise  available  to  other  public  telecommunication 
service providers in Panama. Similarly, such enterprise of Singapore 
shall be fully subject to the jurisdiction of the Ente Regulador de los 
Servicios  Publicos  de  Panama  or  its  successors  as  well  as  to  the 
jurisdiction of any other competent authority of Panama.  
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
An Enterprise of Singapore that applies for a concession to provide 
public  telecommunications  services  in  Panama  shall  be  deemed  to 
have waived to any sovereign immunity it may have as result of the 
Government of Singapore’s participation in such enterprise.   
 
There  is  further  understanding  that  the  Government  of  Singapore 
maintains no restrictions on the entry to its public telecommunications 
market  for  Panamanian  enterprises,  in  which  the  government  of 
Panama has a shareholding, subject to the terms and conditions as set 
out in the preceding three paragraphs as they apply in Singapore.” 
 
 
I  have  the  honor  to  propose  that  this  letter,  together  with  your  letter  of 
confirmation,  shall  constitute  an  agreement  between  the  Parties,  which 
constitutes an integral part of the Agreement and shall take effect on the date 
that the Agreement enters into force.  
 
 
Sincerely,  
 
 
 
 
 
Carmen Gisela Vergara 
Vice-Minister of Foreign Trade 
Ministry of Trade and Industries 
Republic of Panama

I have the honor to confirm receipt of your letter, which reads as follows: 
 
 
“I  have  the  honor  to  refer  to  the  Panama-Singapore  Free  Trade

 I  have  the  honor  to  confirm  that  this  understanding  is  shared  by  my 
Government and constitutes an integral part of the Agreement and shall take 
effect on the date that the Agreement enters into force.
