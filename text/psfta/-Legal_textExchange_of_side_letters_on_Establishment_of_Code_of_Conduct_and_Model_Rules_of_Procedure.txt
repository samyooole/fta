The Honorable 
Mr. Chan Soo Sen 
Minister of State 
for Trade and Industry and Education 
Republic of Singapore 
 
 
I have the honour to refer to the Panama-Singapore Free Trade Agreement 
signed  on  1  March  2006  at  Singapore  (hereafter  referred  to  as  the 
“Agreement”). During the negotiations of Chapter 15 (Dispute Settlement) of 
the  Agreement,  the  delegations  of  Singapore  and  Panama  reached  the 
following agreement: 
 
“That a Code of Conduct pursuant to Article 15.7.6 and a Model Rules 
of Procedure pursuant to Article 15.9.1 will be established by the date 
of entry into force of the Agreement, and the said Code of Conduct and 
Model Rules of Procedure are hereby attached to this letter as Annex A 
and Annex B respectively.” 
 
I have the honour to propose that this letter, together with your letter in reply 
shall constitute an agreement between Singapore and Panama on the Code 
of  Conduct  and  Model  Rules  of  Procedure  for  Chapter  15  (Dispute 
Settlement) which will come into operation as from the date of entry into force 
of the Agreement. 
 
 
 
Yours sincerely, 
 
 
 
 
 
Carmen Gisela Vergara 
Vice-Minister of Foreign Trade
