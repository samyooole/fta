A "chemical reaction" is a process (including a biochemical process)
which results in a molecule with a new structure
by breaking
intramolecular bonds and by forming new intramolecular bonds, or by
altering the spatial arrangement of atoms in a molecule. The following

CHAPTER 29: ORGANIC CHEMICALS.
Note 1: Notwithstanding any of the line-by-line rules, the “chemical
reaction” rule may be applied to any good classified in chapter 29.
The chemical reaction rule allows that a good, product of a chemical
reaction shall be considered to be an originating good if the chemical
reaction occurred in the territory of either or both Parties.
A "chemical reaction" is a process (including a biochemical process)
which results in a molecule with a new structure
by breaking
intramolecular bonds and by forming new intramolecular bonds, or by
altering the spatial arrangement of atoms in a molecule. The following
are not considered to be chemical reactions for the purposes of this
definition: 
(a) dissolving in water or other solvents; 
(b) the eliminating of solvents including solvent water; or 
(c)
the
addition
or
elimination
of
water
of
crystallization.
The chemical reaction rule will not apply to the subheadings 2904.10;

The chemical reaction rule allows that a good, product of a chemical
reaction shall be considered to be an originating good if the chemical
reaction occurred in the territory of either or both Parties.
A "chemical reaction" is a process (including a biochemical process)
which results in a molecule with a new structure
by breaking
intramolecular bonds and by forming new intramolecular bonds, or by
altering the spatial arrangement of atoms in a molecule. The following
are not considered to be chemical reactions for the purposes of this

A "chemical reaction" is a process (including a biochemical process)
which results in a molecule with a new structure
by breaking
intramolecular bonds and by forming new intramolecular bonds, or by
altering the spatial arrangement of atoms in a molecule. The following
are not considered to be chemical reactions for the purposes of this
definition: 
(a) dissolving in water or other solvents; 
(b) the eliminating of solvents including solvent water; or

CHAPTER 40: RUBBER AND ARTICLES THEREOF
Note 1: Notwithstanding any of the line-by-line rules, the “chemical
reaction” rule may be applied to any good classified in chapter 40.
The chemical reaction rule allows that a good, product of a chemical
reaction shall be considered to be an originating good if the chemical
reaction occurred in the territory of either or both Parties.
A "chemical reaction" is a process (including a biochemical process)
which results in a molecule with a new structure
by breaking
intramolecular bonds and by forming new intramolecular bonds, or by
altering the spatial arrangement of atoms in a molecule. The following
are not considered to be chemical reactions for the purposes of this
definition: 
(a) dissolving in water or other solvents; 
(b) the eliminating of solvents including solvent water; or 
(c)
the
addition
or
elimination
of
water
of
crystallization.
