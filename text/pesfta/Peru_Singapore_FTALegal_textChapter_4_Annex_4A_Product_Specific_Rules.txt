“chemicalreaction” rule may be applied to any good classified in chapter 29.The chemical reaction rule allows that a good, product of a chemicalreaction shall be considered to be an originating good if the chemicalreaction occurred in the territory of either or both Parties.A "chemical reaction" is a process (including a biochemical process)which results in a molecule with a new structureby breakingintramolecular bonds and by forming new intramolecular bonds, or byaltering the spatial arrangement of atoms in a molecule. The followingare not considered to be chemical reactions for the purposes of thisdefinition: (a) dissolving in water or other solvents; (b) the eliminating of solvents including solvent water; or (c)theadditionoreliminationofwaterofcrystallization.The chemical reaction rule will not apply to the subheadings 2904.10;2905.45; 2911.00; 2913.00; 2915.70; 2917.12; 2917.32;
