SINGAPORE’S SCHEDULE OF SPECIFIC SERVICES COMMITMENTS  
AANZFTA – Annex 3 (Singapore)  
 
 
 
 
SINGAPORE'S MODES 1-3 SERVICES SCHEDULE  
 
 
EXPLANATORY NOTES 
 
a)  This schedule specifies Singapore’s services commitments for Modes 1, 2, and 3 only.  This schedule does not 
include a Mode 4 component as this is covered in Singapore’s Movement of Natural Persons schedule in Chapter 9 of 
the ASEAN-Australia-New Zealand Free Trade Agreement (AANZFTA). 
 
b)  The classification of service sectors in this schedule is based on the 1991 provisional Central Product Classification 
(CPC) of the United Nations Statistical Office unless otherwise indicated by the absence of a CPC number.  The ordering 
reflects the services sectoral classification list as used in the GATT document MTN.GNS/W/120 dated 10 July 1991.   
   
c)  The use of “**” against individual CPC codes indicates that the specific commitment for that code shall not extend to 
the total range of services covered under that code.  The entry “Unbound*” means unbound due to lack of technical 
feasibility.
