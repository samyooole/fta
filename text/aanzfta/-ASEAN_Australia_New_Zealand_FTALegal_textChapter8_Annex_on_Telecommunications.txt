Where such procedures are not independent of the telecommunications regulatory body, the Party shall ensure that the procedures in fact provide for an objective and impartial review.    128Article 12 Universal Service  Each Party has the right to define the kind of universal service obligation it wishes to maintain. Such obligations, including any cross subsidisation policy set out under each Party’s domestic laws, shall not be regarded as anti-competitive per se, provided they are administered in a transparent, non-discriminatory and competitively neutral manner and are not more burdensome than necessary for the kind of universal service defined by the Party.  Article 13 Allocation and Use of Scarce Resources4  1. Each Party shall administer its procedures for the allocation and use of scarce resources, including frequencies and numbers, in an objective, timely, transparent and non-discriminatory manner.  2. Each Party shall publish or otherwise make publicly available the current state of allocated frequency bands.5  3.
