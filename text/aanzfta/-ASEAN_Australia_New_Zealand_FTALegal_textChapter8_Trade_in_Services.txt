Article 9 Modification of Schedules  1. A Party may modify or withdraw any commitment in its schedule of specific commitments in Annex 3 (Schedules of Specific Services Commitments) or Annex 4 (Schedules of Movement of Natural Persons Commitments), at any time after three years have elapsed from the date on which this Agreement enters into force, in accordance with the procedures set out in Article XXI of GATS, mutatis mutandis, and the Procedures for the Implementation of Article XXI of GATS set out in WTO document S/L/80 of 29 October 1999 (the GATS Article XXI Procedures), mutatis mutandis, as amended from time to time.  2.

Article 10 Domestic Regulation   1. In sectors where specific commitments are undertaken, each Party shall ensure that all measures of general application affecting trade in services are administered in a reasonable, objective and impartial manner.   92 2. With a view to ensuring that measures relating to qualification requirements and procedures, technical standards and licensing requirements and procedures, do not constitute unnecessary barriers to trade in services, the Parties shall jointly review the results of the WTO negotiations on disciplines on such measures, pursuant to Article VI.4 of GATS, and shall amend this Article, as appropriate, after consultations among the Parties, to bring the results of those negotiations into effect under this Agreement. The Parties note that the disciplines arising from such negotiations shall aim to ensure that qualification requirements and procedures, technical standards and licensing requirements and procedures are, inter alia:  (a) based on objective and transparent criteria, such as competence and the ability to supply the service;  (b) not more burdensome than necessary to ensure the quality of the service; and  (c) in the case of licensing procedures, not in themselves a restriction on the supply of the service.  3. In sectors in which a Party has undertaken specific commitments under Article 3 (National Treatment), Article 4 (Market Access) and Article 5 (Additional Commitments), pending the incorporation of the disciplines referred to in Paragraph 2, that Party shall not apply licensing and qualification requirements and technical standards that nullify or impair such specific commitments under this Agreement in a manner which:  (a) does not comply with the criteria outlined in Paragraph 2(a), (b) or (c); and    93(b) could not reasonably have been expected of that Party at the time the specific commitments in those sectors were made.  4. In determining whether a Party is in conformity with its obligations under Paragraph 3(a), account shall be taken of international standards of relevant international organisations applied by that Party.6  5. Where authorisation is required for the supply of a service on which a specific commitment has been made, the competent authorities of that Party shall:  (a) in the case of an incomplete application, at the request of the applicant, identify all the additional information that is required to complete the application and provide the opportunity to remedy deficiencies within a reasonable timeframe;  (b) within a reasonable period of time after the submission of an application considered complete under domestic laws and regulations, inform the applicant of the decision concerning the application;  (c) at the request of the applicant, provide, without undue delay, information concerning the status of the application under consideration; and  (d) if an application is terminated or denied, to the maximum extent possible, inform the applicant in writing, and without delay, the reasons for such action.

Each Party shall ensure that, in any such tribunal or under any such procedures, the parties to any proceedings are provided with the right to:  (a) a reasonable opportunity to support or defend their respective positions; and  (b) a decision in accordance with the Party’s laws.  4. Each Party shall ensure, subject to appeal or further review as provided in its law, that any decision referred to in Paragraph 3(b) shall be implemented in accordance with its laws.  Article 13 Disclosure of Confidential Information  Nothing in this Chapter shall be construed as requiring a Party to provide to the other Parties confidential information the disclosure of which would impede law enforcement or otherwise be contrary to the public interest or which would prejudice the legitimate commercial interests of particular juridical persons, public or private.                                                  8  For avoidance of doubt, “review” includes merits review only where provided for under the Party’s law.   98 Article 14 Monopolies and Exclusive Service Suppliers  1.

If a Party has a reason to believe that a monopoly supplier of a service of any other Party is acting in a manner inconsistent with Paragraph 1 or 2, it may request the Party establishing, maintaining or authorising such supplier to provide specific information concerning the relevant operations.  4. This Article shall also apply to cases of exclusive service suppliers, where a Party, formally or in effect:  (a) authorises or establishes a small number of service suppliers; and  (b) substantially prevents competition among those suppliers in its territory.  Article 15 Business Practices  1. Parties recognise that certain business practices of service suppliers, other than those falling under Article 14   99(Monopolies and Exclusive Service Suppliers), may restrain competition and thereby restrict trade in services.  2. Each Party shall, at the request of any other Party, enter into consultations with a view to eliminating practices referred to in Paragraph 1. The Party addressed shall accord full and sympathetic consideration to such a request and shall co-operate through the supply of publicly available non-confidential information available to the requesting Party. The requested Party may also provide other information available to the requesting Party, subject to its domestic law and to the conclusion of satisfactory agreement concerning the safeguarding of its confidentiality by the requesting Party.  Article 16 Recognition  1. For the purpose of the fulfilment, in whole or in part, of its standards or criteria for the authorisation, licensing or certification of service suppliers, and subject to the requirements of Paragraph 3, a Party may recognise the education or experience obtained, requirements met, licences or certifications granted in a particular country. Such recognition, which may be achieved through harmonisation or otherwise, may be based upon an agreement or arrangement with the country concerned or may be accorded autonomously.  2. A Party that is a party to an agreement or arrangement of the type referred to in Paragraph 1, whether existing or future, shall afford adequate opportunity for other interested Parties to negotiate their accession to such an agreement or arrangement or to negotiate comparable ones with it. Where a Party accords recognition autonomously, it shall afford adequate opportunity for any other Party to demonstrate that education, experience, licences, or certifications obtained or requirements met in that other Party’s territory should be recognised.    1003. A Party shall not accord recognition in a manner which would constitute a means of discrimination between other Parties in the application of its standards or criteria for the authorisation, licensing or certification of service suppliers, or a disguised restriction on trade in services.  4. Where appropriate, recognition should be based on multilaterally agreed criteria. In appropriate cases, Parties shall work in co-operation with relevant inter-governmental and non-governmental organisations towards the establishment and adoption of common international standards and criteria for recognition and common international standards for the practice of relevant services trades and professions.  5. Each Party shall encourage competent bodies in its territory to enter into negotiations for agreements or arrangements on recognition of professional qualification requirements, qualification procedures, licensing or registration requirements, and licensing or registration procedures with a view to the achievement of early outcomes.  Article 17 Payments and Transfers  1. Except under the circumstances envisaged in Article 4 (Measures to Safeguard the Balance of Payments) of Chapter 15 (General Provisions and Exceptions), a Party shall not apply restrictions on international transfers or payments for current transactions relating to its specific commitments.  2. Nothing in this Chapter shall affect the rights and obligations of any of the Parties as members of the International Monetary Fund under the IMF Articles of Agreement, including the use of exchange actions which are in conformity with the IMF Articles of Agreement, provided that a Party shall not impose restrictions on any capital transactions inconsistent with its specific commitments   101regarding such transactions, except under Article 4 (Measures to Safeguard the Balance of Payments) of Chapter 15 (General Provisions and Exceptions) or at the request of the International Monetary Fund.  Article 18 Subsidies  1. Notwithstanding Article 1.4(b) (Scope and Coverage), the Parties shall review the issue of disciplines on subsidies related to trade in services in light of any disciplines agreed under Article XV of GATS.  2. Parties recognise that, in certain circumstances, subsidies may have distortive effects on trade in services. Any Party which considers that it is adversely affected by a subsidy of another Party may request consultations with that Party on such matters. Such request shall be accorded sympathetic consideration.  Article 19 Safeguard Measures  1. The Parties note the multilateral negotiations pursuant to Article X of GATS on the question of emergency safeguard measures based on the principle of non-discrimination. Upon the conclusion of such multilateral negotiations, the Parties shall conduct a review for the purpose of discussing appropriate amendments to this Agreement so as to incorporate the results of such multilateral negotiations.  2. In the event that the implementation of the commitments made in this Agreement causes substantial adverse impact to a service sector of a Party before the conclusion of the multilateral negotiations referred to in Paragraph 1, the affected Party may request consultations with the other Party or Parties. The requested Party or Parties shall enter into consultations with the requesting   102Party on the commitments that the requested Party or Parties consider may have caused substantial adverse impact and on the possibility of the requesting Party adopting any measure to alleviate such impact. The requesting Party shall notify all the other Parties of their request for consultations under this Paragraph.  3. Any measures taken pursuant to Paragraph 2 shall be mutually agreed by the Parties concerned.  4. The consulting Parties shall notify the results of the consultations to all other Parties as soon as practicable and by no later than the next meeting of the Services Committee established pursuant to Article 24 (Committee on Trade in Services) following the conclusion of consultations.
