This indicates that there may be variable tariff rates for goods imported under these tariff lines and that the tariff rates applied will depend on the exact nature of the goods.  For example, goods imported under tariff line 4016.99.79 are a type of vehicle part and are subject to the tariff rate applicable to the vehicle for which the part was designed.  As another example, goods imported under tariff line 9112.20.00 include clock cases and are subject to the rate applicable to the clock for which the case was designed.
