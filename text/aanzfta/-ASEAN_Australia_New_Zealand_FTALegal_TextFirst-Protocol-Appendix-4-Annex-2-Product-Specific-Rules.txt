The “chemical reaction” rule may be applied to any good classified in this Chapter if the product fails to satisfy the regional value content and change in tariff classification criteria provided for in the Product Specific Rule. Note: For the purposes of this Chapter a “chemical reaction” is a process (including a biochemical process) which results in a molecule with a new structure by breaking intramolecular bonds and by forming new intramolecular bonds, or by altering the spatial arrangement of the molecule. The following are not considered to be chemical reactions for the purposes of determining whether a product is an originating good: (a) dissolving in water or other solvents; (b) the elimination of solvents including solvent water; or (c) the addition or elimination of water of crystallization. 2801   Fluorine, chlorine, bromine and iodine   Column  1 Column 2 Column 3 Column 4 Tariff Heading Tariff Sub-Heading Product Description Product Specific Rule   2801.10 - Chlorine RVC(40) or CTSH   2801.20 - Iodine RVC(40) or CTSH   2801.30 - Fluorine;

The “chemical reaction” rule may be applied to any good classified in this Chapter if the product fails to satisfy the regional value content and change in tariff classification criteria provided for in the Product Specific Rule.

The following are not considered to be chemical reactions for the purposes of determining whether a product is an originating good: (a) dissolving in water or other solvents; (b) the elimination of solvents including solvent water; or (c) the addition or elimination of water of crystallization. 2901   Acyclic hydrocarbons     2901.10 -

The “chemical reaction” rule may be applied to any good classified in this Chapter if the product fails to satisfy the regional value content and change in tariff classification criteria provided for in the Product Specific Rule.  Note: For the purposes of this Chapter a “chemical reaction” is a process (including a biochemical process) which results in a molecule with a new structure by breaking intramolecular bonds and by forming new intramolecular bonds, or by altering the spatial arrangement of the molecule. The following are not considered to be chemical reactions for the purposes of determining whether a product is an originating good: (a) dissolving in water or other solvents; (b) the elimination of solvents including solvent water; or (c) the addition or elimination of water of crystallization. 3201   Tanning extracts of vegetable origin; tannins and their salts, ethers, esters and other derivatives     3201.10 -
