1.  Specific commitments in this schedule are prepared in accordance with the WTO Secretariat paper entitled "Scheduling of 
Initial Commitments on Trade in Services:  Explanatory Note" (MTN.GNS/W/164).  The classification of sectors in this schedule is 
based on the 1991 provisional Central Product Classification (CPC) of the United Nations Statistical Office, while the ordering 
reflects the classification system used by the WTO Secretariat in MTN.GNS/W/120.  In the context of CPC listings in the schedule, 
the use of ** against individual CPC listings indicates that the service specified constitutes only part of the total range of activities 
covered by the CPC concordance.
