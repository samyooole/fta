ANNEX ON EXPROPRIATION AND COMPENSATION 
 
1. 
An action or a series of related actions by a Party 
cannot constitute an expropriation unless it interferes with a 
tangible or intangible property right or property interest in a 
covered investment. 
 
2. 
Article 9.1 (Expropriation and Compensation) of 
Chapter 11 (Investment) addresses two situations: 
 
(a) 
the first situation is direct expropriation, where a 
covered investment is nationalised or otherwise 
directly expropriated through formal transfer of 
title or outright seizure; and 
 
(b) 
the second situation is where an action or series 
of related actions by a Party has an effect 
equivalent to direct expropriation without formal 
transfer of title or outright seizure. 
 
3. 
The determination of whether an action or series of 
related actions by a Party, in a specific fact situation, 
constitutes an expropriation of the type referred to in 
Paragraph 2(b) requires a case-by-case, fact-based inquiry 
that considers, among other factors: 
 
(a) 
the economic impact of the government action, 
although the fact that an action or series of 
related actions by a Party has an adverse effect 
on the economic value of an investment, standing 
alone, 
does 
not 
establish 
that 
such 
an 
expropriation has occurred; 
 
(b) 
whether the government action breaches the 
government’s prior binding written commitment to 
the investor whether by contract, licence or other 
legal document; and 
 
 
 
178
(c) 
the character of the government action, including, 
its 
objective 
and 
whether 
the 
action 
is 
disproportionate to the public purpose.1 
 
4. 
Non-discriminatory regulatory actions by a Party that 
are designed and applied to achieve legitimate public welfare 
objectives, such as the protection of public health, safety, 
and the environment do not constitute expropriation of the 
type referred to in Paragraph 2(b). 
                                                 
1  “Public purpose” shall be read with reference to Article 9.1(a) and Article 9.6 
(Expropriation and Compensation) of Chapter 11 (Investment).
