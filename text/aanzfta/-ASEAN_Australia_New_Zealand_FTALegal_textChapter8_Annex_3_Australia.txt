3 In this section, the following terms have the meanings set out in the “Joint Statement on Legal Services” submitted to the WTO (TN/S/W/37 and 
S/CSC/W/46 of 24 February 2005) (“Joint Statement”), which are as shown: 
“legal advisory services” – includes provision of advice to and consultation with clients in matters, including transactions, relationships and disputes, 
involving the application or interpretation of law; participation with or on behalf of clients in negotiations and other dealings with third parties in such 
matters; and preparation of documents governed in whole or in part by law, and the verification of documents of any kind for purposes of and in 
accordance with the requirements of law.  Does not include advice, consultation and documentation services performed by service suppliers entrusted with 
public functions, such as notary services.  (As defined at 3.A(i) of Joint Statement.) 
“legal representational services” – includes preparation of documents intended to be submitted to courts, administrative agencies, and other duly 
constituted official tribunals in matters involving the application and interpretation of law; and appearance before courts, administrative agencies, and other 
duly constituted official tribunals in matters involving the application and interpretation of the specified body of law.  (Footnote 1: The inclusion of 
representational services before administrative agencies and other duly constituted official tribunals within the context of legal services does not 
necessarily mean that a licensed lawyer must supply such services in all cases.  The precise scope of services subject to licensing requirements is subject 
to the discretion of the relevant regulatory authority.)  Does not include documentation services performed by service suppliers entrusted with public 
functions, such as notary services.  (As defined at 3.A(ii) of Joint Statement.)

mediators in any dispute involving the application and interpretation of law.  Does not include arbitration and conciliation/mediation services in disputes for 
which the law has not a bearing which fall under services incidental to management consulting.  As a sub-category, international legal arbitration and 
conciliation/mediation services refers to the same services when the dispute involves parties from two or more countries.  (As defined at 3.A(iii) of Joint 
Statement.) 
“domestic law (host country law)” – the law of Australia.  (Derived from definition at 3.B(i) of Joint Statement.)

carriage of goods, is issued and who is responsible for the carriage of goods pursuant to the contract of carriage. 
 
2. 
Cabotage: for the purposes of this Schedule only, cabotage is defined as the transportation of passengers or goods between a port located in 
Australia and another port located in Australia and traffic originating and terminating in the same port located in Australia. 
 
3. 
Offshore Transport refers to shipping services involving the transportation of passengers or goods between a port located in Australia and any 
location associated with or incidental to, the exploration or exploitation of natural resources of the continental shelf of Australia, the seabed of 
the Australian coastal sea and the subsoil of that seabed. 
 
4. 
Other Forms of Commercial Presence for the Supply of International Maritime Transport Services: for the purposes of this Schedule, means 
the ability for international maritime transport service suppliers of other Parties to undertake locally all activities which are necessary for the 
supply to their customers of a partially or fully integrated transport service, within which the maritime transport constitutes a substantial

delivery. 
 
 
These activities include: 
 
 
- 
marketing and sales of maritime transport and related services through direct contact with customers, from quotation to invoicing, these 
services being those operated or offered by the service supplier itself or by service suppliers with which the service seller has established 
standing business arrangements; 
 
 
- 
the acquisition, on their own account or on behalf of their customers (and the resale to their customers) of any transport and related 
services, including inward transport services by any mode, particularly inland waterways, road and rail, necessary for the supply of the 
integrated service;

6.  Maritime Cargo Handling Services: activities exercised by stevedore companies, including terminal operators, but not including the direct 
activities of dockers, when this workforce is organised independently of the stevedoring of terminal operator companies.  The activities 
covered include the organisation and supervision of: the loading/discharging of cargo to/from a ship; the lashing/unlashing of cargo; and, 
the reception/delivery and safekeeping of cargoes in the wharf area before shipment or after discharge. 
 
The organisation and supervision includes the arrangements for (1) engaging skilled labour (dockers), (2) using all the necessary 
equipment for on-board or shore use and the appropriate storage space, whether by ownership, rental or otherwise, (3) the checking of 
parcels and markings, the weighing and measuring of cargo (upon request of the owner), and (4) the administrative duties as well as the

the companies; acquisition and resale of the necessary related services, preparation of documentation, and provision of business 
information 
 
- 
acting on behalf of the companies organising the call of the ship or taking over cargoes when required. 
 
 
 
 
Note on Liner Shipping 
 
Part X of the Trade Practices Act 1974 provides for exemptions from Australian anti-trust legislation so that liner shipping conferences can 
operate in and out of Australia.  Part  X requires that every ocean carrier who provides international liner cargo shipping services to or from 
Australia shall, at all times be represented by a person who is an individual resident in Australia (but not necessarily an Australian citizen) and 
has been appointed by the ocean carrier as the ocean carrier's agent for the purposes of Part X.
