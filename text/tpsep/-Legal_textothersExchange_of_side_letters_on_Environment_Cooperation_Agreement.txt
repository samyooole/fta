Dear Minister  
 
 
I refer to the conclusion on this date of the Environment Cooperation 
Agreement Among the Parties to the Trans-Pacific Strategic Economic 
Partnership Agreement (the Agreement) and to the discussion in relation to 
the final provisions of these agreements.  I have the honour to confirm the 
following understandings reached by Brunei Darussalam, Chile, New Zealand 
and Singapore during the course of the negotiations: 
 
The Agreement shall remain in force for a Party as long as that Party remains 
party to the Trans-Pacific Strategic Economic Partnership Agreement.  If a 
Party withdraws from the Trans-Pacific Strategic Economic Partnership 
Agreement, the Agreement shall terminate for that Party on the same date as 
such withdrawal becomes effective.  If a Party withdraws from the Agreement, 
the Trans-Pacific Strategic Economic Partnership Agreement shall terminate 
for that Party on the same date as such withdrawal becomes effective. 
 
I have the honour to propose that this letter and your letter of confirmation in 
reply shall constitute an integral part of the Agreement. 
 
 
Yours sincerely

Agreement.  If a Party withdraws from the Trans-Pacific Strategic 
Economic Partnership Agreement, the Agreement shall terminate for 
that Party on the same date as such withdrawal becomes effective.  If a 
Party withdraws from the Agreement, the Trans-Pacific Strategic 
Economic Partnership Agreement shall terminate for that Party on the 
same date as such withdrawal becomes effective.”

are shared by my Government and your letter and this reply shall constitute
