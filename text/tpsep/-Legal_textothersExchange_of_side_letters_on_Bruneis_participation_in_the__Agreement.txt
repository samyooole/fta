Upon

the Agreement 
shall 
apply 
provisionally 
to
Brunei 
Darussalam 
after 
it 
submits 
to 
the 
parties 
an
instrument 
confirming 
such 
provisional 
application. 
The
Agreement 
however 
shall 
not 
initially 
be 
applicable 
in
respect 
of 
Chapter 
11 
-Government 
Procurement 
and
Chapter 
12 
-Trade 
in Services 
whereby 
the

below 
explains 
the 
conditions 
applicable 
to 
these 
two
Chapters;
.
All the 
parties 
agree 
that 
Brunei 
Darussalam 
shall 
have 
two
years, 
after 
entry 
into 
force 
of the Agreement, 
to prepare,
negotiate 
and finalise 
its Schedule 
to Annex 
11.A

all 
the

of 
its 
Annexes 
for 
both
Chapters, 
Brunei 
Darussalam 
shall 
within 
two 
months
submit 
its 
Instrument 
of 
Ratification, 
Approval 
or
Acceptance 
to the Agreement;
It 
was 
further 
agreed 
by 
ail 
the 
parties 
that 
Brunei
Darussalam 
shall

Board, 
which 
has
a procurement 
value 
limited 
to 8$250,000.00 
or less, 
from
the 
Government 
Procurement 
Chapter 
of the 
Agreement.
As such this 
limit 
or value 
shall therefore 
be maintained 
and
be included 
as a qualification 
in its Schedule 
to Annex 
11.A
of the Government 
Procurement 
Chapter;

Brunei

Policy 
of the

and changes 
to its policies 
on competition
and 
further 
acknowledge 
that 
establishment 
of a competition
law and a competition 
authority 
shall 
constitute 
application 
of
the 
provision

the 
Competition 
Chapter 
to 
Brunei
Darussalam.
I 
hope 
that 
the

I 
have

not only 
the 
understanding

on

New Zealand 
and Singapore 
of the 
conditions 
in
which 
Brunei 
Darussalam 
shall

I look 
forward 
to your 
confirmatory 
response

such 
conditions 
shall 
be incorporated

text 
of
the Agreement.

applicafion of the provision of the Competition Chapter to
