           Article 15.1: Objectives    CHAPTER 15   DISPUTE SETTLEMENT  1.  The Parties shall at all times endeavour to agree on the interpretation and application of this Agreement, and shall make every attempt through cooperation and consultations to arrive at a mutually satisfactory resolution of any matter that might affect its operation.    2.  The objective of this Chapter is to provide an effective, efficient and transparent process for consultations and settlement of disputes among the Parties concerning their rights and obligations under this Agreement.   Article 15.2: Scope  1.  Except as otherwise provided in this Agreement, the dispute settlement provisions of this Chapter shall apply:  (a)    (b)      (c)  with respect to the avoidance or settlement of all disputes between the Parties regarding the interpretation or application of this Agreement;    wherever a Party considers that an actual or proposed measure of another Party is or would be inconsistent with the obligations of this  Agreement or that another Party has otherwise failed to carry out its obligations under this Agreement; or  wherever a Party considers that an actual or proposed measure of another Party causes nullification or impairment in the sense of Annex 15.A.  2.   Subject to Article 15.3, this Chapter is without prejudice to the rights of the Parties to have recourse to dispute settlement procedures available under other agreements to which they are parties.   Article 15.3:  Choice of Forum  1.  Where a dispute regarding any matter arises under this Agreement and under another trade agreement to which the disputing Parties are party, the complaining Party may select the forum in which to settle the dispute.   15-1    2.    The complaining Party shall notify the other Parties in writing of its intention to bring a dispute to a particular forum before doing so.  Where a Party wishes to have recourse to a different dispute settlement forum from that notified by another  complaining Party, the complaining Parties shall consult with a view to reaching agreement on a single forum in which to settle the dispute.  3.  Once a complaining Party has initiated dispute settlement proceedings  under Article 15.6, under the WTO Agreement or any other trade agreement to which the disputing Parties are party,1 the forum selected shall be used to the exclusion of the others.    4.  Where there is more than one dispute on the same matter arising under this Agreement against a Party, the disputes shall be joined.   Article 15.4:  Consultations  1.  Any Party may request in writing consultations with any other Party with respect to any actual or proposed measure of that Party that it considers  inconsistent with this Agreement or any other matter that it considers might affect  the operation of this Agreement, which shall be circulated to all Parties to this  Agreement through the Contact Points designated in accordance with Article 14.5  (Contact Points).  2.  All such requests for consultations shall set out the reasons for the request,  including the identification of the actual or proposed measure or other matter at issue and an indication of the legal basis for the complaint.  3.   The Party to which a request for consultations is made shall reply to the request in writing within 7 days after the date of its receipt. The response to the request for consultations shall be circulated to all Parties.  4.  Whenever a Party other than the consulting Parties considers that it has an interest in the consultations, such Party may notify the consulting Parties within 7 days after the notification of the request for consultations, of its desire to be joined in the consultations. The Party complained against shall give positive consideration to any request from a Party to attend consultations requested by any other Party.  5.   The Parties shall enter into consultations within a period of no more than:    (a) 15 days after the date of receipt of the request for matters concerning perishable goods; or      1 For the purposes of this Article, dispute settlement proceedings under the WTO Agreement or any other trade agreement are deemed to have been initiated upon a request by a Party for the  establishment of a panel or by referral of a matter to an arbitral tribunal. 15-2       6.    (b) 30 days after the date of receipt of the request for all other matters.  The consulting Parties shall make every attempt to reach a mutually  satisfactory resolution of any matter through consultations under this Article.  To  this end, the consulting Parties shall:  (a) provide sufficient information to enable a full examination of how the actual or proposed measure or other matter might affect the operation and application of this Agreement; and  (b) treat any confidential information exchanged in the course of consultations on the same basis as the Party providing the information.  7.  With a view to reaching a mutually satisfactory resolution of the matter, the requesting Party may make representations or proposals to the responding Party, which shall give due consideration to the representations or proposals made to it.  8.  In consultations under this Article, a consulting Party may request another  consulting Party to make available personnel of its government agencies or other regulatory bodies who have expertise in the matter subject to consultations.   Article 15.5:  Good Offices, Conciliation and Mediation  1.  Good offices, conciliation and mediation are procedures undertaken voluntarily if the disputing Parties so agree.  2.  Proceedings involving good offices, conciliation and mediation, and in particular the positions taken by the disputing Parties during these proceedings,  shall be confidential and without prejudice to the rights of any Party in any further proceedings under these procedures.  3.  Good offices, conciliation or mediation may be requested at any time by any disputing Party.  They may begin at any time and be terminated at any time.  Once procedures for good offices, conciliation or mediation are concluded without an agreement between the disputing Parties, the complaining Party may request the establishment of an arbitral tribunal under Article 15.6.  4.  If the disputing Parties agree, good offices, conciliation or mediation may  continue while the dispute proceeds for resolution before an arbitral tribunal convened under Article 15.6.   Article 15.6: Establishment of an Arbitral Tribunal  1.  The complaining Party may request, by means of a written notification  15-3    addressed to the Party complained against, the establishment of an arbitral tribunal if the consulting Parties fail to resolve the matter within:  (a) 45 days after the date of receipt of the request for consultations under  Article 15.4;  (b) 30 days after the date of receipt of the request for consultations under  Article 15.4 in a matter regarding perishable goods; or  (c) such other period as the consulting Parties agree.  2.

Benefits may not be suspended while the complaining Party is pursuing negotiations under Paragraphs 1 or 2.  4.  Compensation and the suspension of benefits shall be temporary measures.   Neither compensation nor the suspension of benefits is preferred to full implementation of a decision to bring a measure into conformity with this Agreement.

The arbitral tribunal shall present its determination within 60 days from the request made pursuant to Paragraph 6, or if an arbitral tribunal cannot be established with its original arbitrators, from the date on which the last arbitrator is  selected.  The ruling of the arbitral tribunal shall be final and binding.  It shall be delivered to the disputing Parties and be made publicly available.   Article 15.16 : Compliance Review  1.  Without prejudice to the procedures in Article 15.15, if the responding Party  considers that it has eliminated the non-conformity or the nullification or impairment that the arbitral tribunal found, it may refer the matter to the arbitral tribunal by  providing written notice to the other Party.  The arbitral tribunal shall issue its report on the matter within 90 days after the responding Party provides notice.  15-10      2.
