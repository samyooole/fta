   (date)   His Royal Highness, Prince Mohamed Bolkiah  Minister for Foreign Affairs Brunei Darussalam  Hon Ignacio Walker Minister of Foreign Affairs Republic of Chile  Hon Lim Hng Kiang Minister of Trade and Industry Republic of Singapore  Dear Minister   I refer to the opening for signature of the Trans-Pacific Strategic Economic Partnership Agreement ("the Agreement") and to the discussions on the Tariff Elimination Schedule of Brunei Darussalam.  I have the honour to confirm the following understandings reached by Brunei Darussalam, Chile, New Zealand and Singapore during the course of the negotiations.  In respect of those products which Brunei Darussalam has not included in its Tariff Elimination Schedule (listed as an attachment to this letter) on the grounds of protection of public morals, human health and security, I propose that all Parties to the Agreement continue to discuss the way in which these products may be accommodated in the context of the Agreement, taking into account the Parties' objectives of negotiating a comprehensive free trade agreement.  Pending conclusion of these discussions, Brunei Darussalam will not increase any tariffs on these products but may maintain any existing tariffs as specified in the attachment to this letter.  I have the honour to propose that this letter and your letter of confirmation in reply shall constitute an integral part of the Agreement.
