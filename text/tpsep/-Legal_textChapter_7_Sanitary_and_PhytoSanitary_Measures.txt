Equivalence may be recognised by the Parties in relation to an individual measure and/or groups of measures and/or systems applicable to a sector or part of a sector as specified in Implementing Arrangement 4.   The equivalence determinations recorded in Implementing Arrangement 4 shall be applied to trade among the relevant Parties in animals and animal products, plants and plant  products, or as appropriate to related goods.  2.  The recognition of equivalence requires an assessment and acceptance of:  (a) the legislation, standards and procedures, as well as the programmes in place to allow control and to ensure domestic and importing country requirements are met;  (b) the documented structure of the competent authority(ies), their powers, their chain of command, their modus operandi and the resources available to them; and  (c) the performance of the competent authority in relation to the control and assurance programmes.

The Parties may add to or amend the steps in the process in the future as the Parties’ experience in regard to the determination of equivalence process  increases.   7-4    4.    Where equivalence has not been recognised or where an application is  pending, trade shall take place under the conditions required by the importing Party  to meet its appropriate level of protection.  These conditions shall be as set out in Implementing Arrangement 4 where such conditions have been agreed.  If conditions have not been agreed and incorporated in Implementing Arrangement 4, then the conditions to be met by the exporting Party shall be those specified by the importing Party.  The exporting Party may agree to meet the importing Party's  conditions, without affecting the result of the process set out in Implementing Arrangement 8.  5.                        6.

The model attestation for  such certificates will be prescribed in Implementing Arrangement 6.  The Parties may jointly determine principles or guidelines for certification, which shall be included in Implementing Arrangement 6.     Article 7.8: Verification    1.
