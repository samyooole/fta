Dear Minister 
 
 
I refer to the conclusion on this date of the Trans-Pacific Strategic Economic 
Partnership Agreement (the “Agreement”) among Brunei Darussalam, Chile, 
New Zealand and Singapore and to the discussions in relation to Chapter 8 
(Technical Barriers to Trade) of the Agreement.  I have the honour to confirm 
the 
following 
understandings 
reached 
by 
Brunei 
Darussalam, 
Chile, 
New Zealand and Singapore during the course of the negotiations regarding the 
establishment of a Committee on Technical Barriers to Trade under the 
Agreement and the establishment of a work programme for this Committee. 
 
The Committee on Technical Barriers to Trade in the first instance will 
comprise: 
 
Brunei Darussalam: Ismail Hj Hamdan, Construction Planning and 
Research Unit, Ministry of Development; 
Chile: Ana Maria Vallina, Director, Ministry of the Economy; 
New Zealand: Sharon Anne Blaikie, Senior Adviser, Ministry of 
Economic Development; 
Singapore: Ng Kim Neo, Consultant, Ministry of Trade and Industry. 
 
Work programmes will initially be established on: electrical safety and electro 
magnetic compatibility of electrical and electronic equipment; grading 
programmes for the purposes of marketing beef; and shoe labelling.  Trade 
facilitators, relevant regulators from New Zealand, Brunei Darussalam, Chile 
and Singapore, members of the SEP Committee on Technical Barriers to Trade 
 
 
 
 
 
2 
 
 
 
and any other expert as needed, will participate as required in these work 
programmes.  
 
I would like to suggest that the work programmes on electrical safety and 
electromagnetic compatibility, beef grading and shoe labelling be initiated, via 
teleconferences of the trade facilitators, relevant regulators and stakeholders 
from each country, no later than November 2005. 
 
If the above proposals are acceptable, I have the honour to propose that this 
letter and your confirmatory reply will constitute the understandings between our 
Governments on the initial future work programme for the Committee on 
Technical Barriers to Trade under the Agreement. 
 
 
Yours sincerely
