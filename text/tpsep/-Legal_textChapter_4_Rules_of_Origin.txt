Article 4.2:  Originating Goods 
 
Unless otherwise indicated in this Chapter, a good shall be considered as 
originating in a Party when: 
 
(a)  the good is wholly obtained or produced entirely in the territory of one 
Party, pursuant to the definition in Article 4.1;

Article 4.3:  Regional Value Content 
   
1.  Where Annex II refers to a regional value content, each Party shall provide 
that the regional value content of a good shall be calculated on the basis of the 
following method:   
 
 TV - VNM   
RVC   =   ---------------   x 100 
                      TV 
 
where: 
   
RVC  is the regional value content expressed as a percentage;   
   
TV      is the transaction value of the good, adjusted on an FOB 
basis, except as provided in Paragraph 3. If no such value exists or 
cannot be determined, pursuant to the principles of Article 1 of the 
Customs Valuation Agreement, it shall be calculated pursuant to the 
principles of Articles 2 to 7 of that Agreement; and 
   
VNM  is the transaction value of the non-originating materials, when  
they were first acquired or supplied to the producer of the goods, 
adjusted on a CIF basis, except as provided in Paragraph 4.  If such 
value does not exist or cannot be determined, pursuant to the principles  
of Article 1 of the Customs Valuation Agreement, it shall be calculated 
pursuant to that Agreement.   
 
 
 
 
4-4    
   
   
2.  The value of the non-originating materials used by the producer in the 
production of a good shall not include, for purposes of calculating the regional 
value content, pursuant to Paragraph 1, the value of non-originating materials used  
to produce the originating materials subsequently used in the production of the 
good. 
   
3.  When the producer of a good does not export it directly, the value shall be  
adjusted up to the point at which the purchaser receives the good within the 
territory of a Party where the producer is located. 
   
4.  When the producer of the good acquires a non-originating material in the 
territory of the Party where it is located, the value of such material shall not include 
freight, insurance, packing costs and any other costs incurred in transporting the 
material from the supplier's warehouse to the producer's location. 
 
 
Article 4.4:  Operations that do not Confer Origin 
 
The minimal operations or processes that do not confer origin, include the 
following: 
 
(a)  operations to ensure the preservation of products in good condition 
during transport and storage (such as drying, freezing, ventilation,  
chilling and like operations); 
 
(b)  simple operations consisting of sifting, classifying, washing, cutting,  
slitting, bending, coiling, or uncoiling; 
 
(c)  changes of packing and breaking up and assembly of consignments;

goods in the territory of another Party shall be considered to originate in the 
territory of the latter Party. 
 
 
 
 
4-5  
 
 
Article 4.6:  De Minimis 
 
A good that does not conform to a change in tariff classification, pursuant to 
the provisions of Annex II, shall be considered to be originating if the value of all 
non-originating materials used in its production not meeting the change in tariff 
classification requirement does not exceed 10 percent of the transaction value of 
the given good pursuant to Article 4.3, and the good meets all the other applicable 
criteria of this Chapter.   
 
 
Article 4.7:  Accessories, Spare Parts, and Tools 
   
1.  Normal accessories, spare parts, or tools provided with the good as part of 
the standard accessories, spare parts, or tools shall be regarded as originating 
goods and shall be disregarded in determining whether or not all the non- 
originating materials used in the production of the originating goods undergo the 
applicable change in tariff classification, provided that: 
 
(a)  the accessories, spare parts, or tools are classified with and not invoiced 
separately from the good; and 
 
(b)  the quantities and the value of those accessories, spare parts, or tools  
are the normal ones for the good. 
   
2.  If the goods are subject to a regional value content requirement, the value of 
the accessories, spare parts, or tools shall be taken into account as originating or 
non-originating materials, as the case may be, in calculating the regional value 
content of the goods.   
 
 
Article 4.8:  Packaging Materials and Containers for Retail Sale 
 
Packaging materials and containers in which goods are packaged for retail 
sale, if classified with the goods, shall be disregarded in determining whether all 
the non-originating materials used in the production of those goods have 
undergone the applicable change in tariff classification set out in Annex II.  
However, if the goods are subject to a regional value content requirement the value 
of the packaging used for retail sale will be counted as originating or non- 
originating, as the case may be, in calculating the regional value content of the 
goods.   
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
4-6  
 
 
Article 4.9: Packing Materials and Containers for Shipment 
 
Packing materials and containers in which a good is packed exclusively for 
transport shall not be taken into account for purposes of establishing whether the 
good is originating. 
 
 
Article 4.10: Indirect Materials 
 
Indirect materials shall be considered to be originating materials without 
regard to where they are produced and its value shall be the cost registered in the 
accounting records of the producer of the good. 
 
 
Article 4.11: Transit through Non-Parties 
   
1.  Preferential tariff treatment provided for in this Agreement shall be applied to  
goods that satisfy the requirements of this Chapter and which are directly  
transported among the Parties. 
   
2.  Notwithstanding Paragraph 1, goods shall be authorised to transit through 
non-Party countries, and to remain stored for a reasonable period of time, which in 
no case shall be more than 6 months from the date of entry of the goods into the 
third non-Party country.   
   
3.  Goods shall be eligible for preferential tariff treatment in accordance with 
this Agreement if they are transported through the territory of one or more non- 
Parties, provided that the goods:       
             
(a)  did  not  undergo  operations  other  than  unloading,                          
  reloading, or any other operation necessary to preserve them in good 
 
condition; and 
 
 
 
  (b)  did not enter the commerce of such non-Parties after the shipment from 
  the Party and before the importation into another Party.                                     
 
 
4.  Compliance with the provisions set out in Paragraphs 2 and 3  shall be 
proved by means of supplying to the customs authorities of the importing Party 
either customs documents of the third country or documents of the competent 
authorities, including commercial shipping or freight documents. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
4-7  
 
 
Article 4.12: Outward Processing 
   
1.  Notwithstanding the relevant provisions of Article 4.2 and the product- 
specific requirements set out in Annex II, a good listed in Annex 4.B shall be 
considered as originating even if it has undergone processes of production or 
operation outside the territory of a Party on a material exported from the Party and 
subsequently re-imported to the Party, provided that: 
 
(a)  the total value of non-originating materials as set out in Paragraph 2 
does not exceed 55 percent of the customs value of the final good for  
which originating status is claimed; 
 
(b)  the materials exported from a Party shall have been wholly obtained or  
produced in the Party or have undergone therein, processes of  
production or operation going beyond the minimal processes or  
operations in Article 4.4, prior to being exported outside the territory of 
the Party; 
 
(c)  the producer of the exported material is the same producer of the final 
good for which originating status is claimed;   
 
(d)  the re-imported good has been obtained through processes of  
production or operation of the exported material; and 
 
(e)  the last process of manufacture of the good was performed in the 
territory of the Party,  and this process is the last activity undertaken in 
respect to a good that finally transforms it into a good different from its  
component parts or materials and a new good is therefore 
manufactured.   
   
2.  For the purposes of Paragraph 1(a), the total value of non-originating  
materials shall be the value of any non-originating materials added in a Party as 
well as the value of any materials added and all other costs accumulated outside 
the territory of the Party, including transportation costs. 
   
3.  For greater certainty, the verification procedures referred to in Article 4.16 
shall apply in order to ensure the proper application of this Article. Such 
procedures include the provision of information and supporting documentation, 
including that relating to the export of originating materials and the subsequent re- 
import of the goods subsequently exported as originating goods, by the exporting 
customs administration or exporter upon receipt of a written request from the 
customs administration of the importing Party through the customs administration 
of the exporting Party. 
   
4.  Upon the request of a Party, the list of products in Annex 4.B may be 
modified by the Commission.   
 
4-8  
 
 
 
 
 
Article 4.13: Treatment of Goods for which Preference is Claimed   
   
1.  A Party can accept either; a declaration as to origin on the export invoice 
(declaration), or a certificate of origin, in respect of a good imported from any other  
Party for which an importer claims preferential tariff treatment. 
 
2.    An exporter or producer may elect to use either a declaration as to origin on 
the export invoice or a certificate of origin, either of which may then be used by the 
importer as evidence of origin in respect to goods for which preferential tariff  
treatment is claimed. 
   
3.  The declaration or certificate of origin shall be completed by the exporter or 
producer, as the case may be.  The declaration or certificate of origin shall:     
 
(a)  specify that the goods enumerated thereon are the origin of the 
exporting Party and meet the terms of this Chapter; 
 
(b)  be made in respect of one or more goods; and which can include a 
variety of goods; and 
 
(c)  be completed in English.   
   
4.  The export invoice upon which the declaration as to origin is affixed and in 
respect of the goods subject to the declaration shall include: 
 
(a)  a full description; 
 
(b)  six digit Harmonized System Code;   
 
(c)  the producer's name(s) if known; and 
 
(d)  the importer's name(s) in respect of imported goods, if known. 
   
5.  If the export invoice does not include the information referred to in 
Paragraph 4, it must be added in "observations" on the declaration as to origin in 
the form set out in Annex 4.C.   
 
6.  The declaration shall be in the form set out in Annex 4.C, and the certificate 
of origin shall be in the form set out in Annex 4.D.  These requirements may 
thereafter be revised or modified by an Implementing Arrangement agreed among 
the Parties. 
   
7.  The declaration and the certificate of origin shall remain valid for a period of 
2 years from the date on which the respective documents were issued. 
 
4-9    
   
   
   
   
8.  If the exporter is not the producer of the good referred to on the declaration 
or on the certificate of origin, that exporter may complete and sign the declaration 
on the basis of: 
 
(a)  the exporter's knowledge of whether the good qualifies as an originating 
good; or 
 
(b)  a producer’s written declaration that the good qualifies as an originating 
good in that it meets the terms of this Chapter. 
   
9.  Nothing in Paragraph 8(b) shall be construed to require a producer who is  
not the exporter of the good to make a declaration or complete a certificate of  
origin. 
 
10.  Slight discrepancies as between the wording and detail stated on the export  
invoice or certificate of origin produced to the customs administration of the 
importing Party in clearance of goods shall not, of itself, cause any claim for 
preferential tariff treatment to be denied. 
 
11.  Any declaration or certificate of origin presented in the clearance of goods  
issued in advance of the entry into force of this Agreement shall, if presented on or  
after the date of entry into force of this Agreement, be accepted as evidence as to 
the origin of the good specified thereon.   
 
12.  The customs administration of the importing Party shall, in accordance with 
its domestic legislation, grant preferential tariff treatment to goods of another Party  
only in those instances that an importer: 
 
(a)  provides to the customs administration a declaration or certificate of 
origin in accord with the provisions of this Article; or 
 
(b)  provides sufficient documentary or other evidence to substantiate the 
tariff preference claimed for the goods.   
 
13.  The Parties shall, in accordance with their domestic legislation, provide that 
where an importer claims at the time of importation a good can meet the terms of 
this Chapter and would thereby have qualified for preferential tariff treatment but  
was unable to provide a declaration or a certificate of origin or other such evidence 
as provided for in Paragraph 12 the importer may, in accordance with domestic 
legislation or within 1 year from date of importation, apply for a refund of any  
excess customs duties paid as a result of the goods not having been accorded 
preferential tariff treatment, on production of: 
 
(a)  a declaration or certificate of origin that the good qualifies as an 
originating good; and 
 
4-10  
 
 
 
 
(b)  such other evidence as the customs administration may require to 
satisfactorily evidence the tariff preference claimed. 
 
14.  An importing Party may not require a declaration or certificate of origin to 
admit goods pursuant to tariff preference where:   
 
(a)  the customs value does not exceed US$1000 or the equivalent amount 
in the Party's currency or a higher amount as it may establish; or 
 
(b)  in respect of specific goods, a Party has waived the requirement for 
such evidence. 
 
15.  In accordance with Paragraph 14, where an importation forms part of a 
series of importations that may reasonably be considered to have been undertaken 
or arranged for the purposes of avoiding the origin requirements of this Article, the 
customs administration of the importing Party may deny preferential tariff 
treatment.   
 
 
Article 4.14: Obligations Regarding Exports 
   
1.  Where the exporter or producer becomes aware that it has provided an 
erroneous or false declaration or certificate of origin or any other such erroneous or  
false evidence, the exporter or producer shall give notice as soon as possible to  
the customs administrations of the importing and exporting Party, as well as the 
importer, of any change that would affect the accuracy or validity of a declaration or  
certificate of origin. 
   
2.  The exporter or producer that has provided a declaration or a certificate of 
origin, shall provide a copy of these documents to its exporting Party's customs 
administration upon request.   
 
3.  With respect to exports, each Party shall provide penalties for false 
declarations, certification, or documentation related to origin submitted to a 
customs administration by an exporter or producer in its territory. 
 
 
Article 4.15: Records 
 
Each Party shall require that producers, exporters and importers in their 
respective territories maintain for a period of not less than 3 years after the date of 
exportation or importation, as the case may be, all records relating to that 
exportation or importation which are necessary to demonstrate that a good for 
which a claim for tariff preference was made qualifies for preferential tariff  
treatment. 
 
4-11  
 
 
 
 
 
Article 4.16: Verification of Origin 
   
1.  For the purposes of determining whether goods imported into the territory of  
a Party from the territory of another Party qualify as originating goods, the 
importing Party may, through its customs administration, verify any claims made for 
tariff preference by means of: 
 
(a)  written requests for information addressed to the importer; 
 
(b)  written questions and requests for information addressed to the exporter 
or producer in the territory of the exporting Party through the customs 
administrations of the exporting Party;   
 
(c)  requests to the customs administration of the exporting Party to verify 
the origin of the good; or 
 
(d)  such other procedures as the customs administrations of the Parties 
may agree. 
   
2.  If the mechanism established in Paragraph 1 fails to determine the origin of  
a good, the importing Party may request, through the customs administration of the 
exporting Party, to visit the premises of the exporter or producer in the territory of 
the exporting Party:   
 
(a)  to review records referring to origin; and 
 
(b)  to observe the facilities used in production of the goods. 
   
3.  The requesting Party shall, through its customs administration: 
   
  (a)  ensure that any request made to the customs administration of the 
 
exporting Party is sufficiently material to warrant the request and is  
 
  accompanied by sufficient information to identify the particular goods  
  and the exporter or producer of those goods; and 
 
 
 
  (b)  specify a period of 60 days from the date the written questions or 
  request was sent to the exporter or producer to fully respond to the 
 
questions or request. 
 
 
 
4.  The Parties agree to facilitate requests for assistance through their customs 
administrations under this Article within 10 days of receipt of the request. 
 
 
 
 
 
4-12  
 
 
Article 4.17: Decision on Origin 
   
1.  If as a result of questions put or visits made to the exporter or producer the 
requesting Party is satisfied the goods about which those questions were put or 
visits made are originating goods pursuant to the provisions of this Chapter, it shall 
permit preferential access for those goods. 
   
2.  Preferential tariff treatment may be denied if: 
   
  (a)  the goods do not or did not meet the requirements of this Chapter; 
 
 
 
  (b)  the exporter or producer fails to respond fully to questions put by the 
  customs administration of the importing Party within 60 days of the date 
 
of the request of the importing Party, or such other extended period of 
 
  time as may be specified by the customs administrations of the 
  importing Party, but not more than an additional 30 days;  
 
 
 
(c)  the requested customs administration is, for any reason, unable to 
 
  comply with a request from the customs administration of the importing 
 
Party to verify the origin of goods and advises the requesting customs 
 
administration of this inability or, fails to respond to a request within 90 
 
  days; or 
   
 
(d)  the exporter or producer does not agree to a visit by the customs 
 
administration of the importing Party within 30 days. 
 
   
3.  In the event preferential tariff treatment is denied the importing Party shall 
ensure that its customs administration provides in writing to the exporter, the 
importer or producer, as the case may be, full reasons for that decision. 
   
4.  Where verifications by a Party indicate a pattern of conduct by an exporter  
or a producer of false or unsupported representations that a good imported into its 
territory qualifies as an originating good, the Party may withhold preferential tariff 
treatment to identical goods exported or produced by such a person until it is  
satisfied that the exporter or producer is no longer making false or unsupported 
representations as to origin. 
 
 
Article 4.18: Costs Incurred 
 
1.    The ordinary costs of complying with a request for verification will be borne 
by: 
 
(a)  the requested Party; or 
 
 
 
 
4-13  
 
 
(b)  the Party which visits an exporter or producer, as the case may be, in 
the territory of the other Party. 
 
2.    Where extraordinary costs or doubts in determining costs arise, these shall 
be resolved by mutual agreement between Parties.

CERTIFICATE OF ORIGIN INSTRUCTIONS 
Pursuant to Article 4.13, for the purposes of obtaining preferential tariff treatment this document must be completed legibly and in full by 
the exporter or producer and be in the possession of the importer at the time the declaration is made. Please print or type: 
Issuing Number: Fill in the serial number of the certificate of origin. 
Field 1:  State the full legal name, address (including country) and legal tax identification number of the exporter. The legal tax  
identification number in Chile is the Unique Tax Number (“Rol Unico Tributario”).  The tax identification number is not  
applicable for Brunei Darussalam, New Zealand and Singapore.  
Field 2:  If one producer, state the full legal name, address (including country, telephone number, fax number and email address) and  
legal tax identification number, as defined in Field 1, of said producer.  (Tax ID is not applicable to Brunei Darussalam,  
New Zealand and Singapore.)  If more than one producer is included on the Certificate, state "Various" and attach a list of  
all producers, including their legal name, address (including country, telephone number, fax number and email address) and  
legal tax identification number, cross referenced to the good or goods described in Field 4.  If you wish this information to  
be confidential, it is acceptable to state " Available to Customs upon request".  If the producer and the exporter are the 
same, complete field with "SAME".  If the producer is unknown, it is acceptable to state "UNKNOWN". 
Field 3:  State the full legal name, address (including country) as defined in Field 1, of the importer; if the importer is not known,  
state "UNKNOWN"; if multiple importers, state "VARIOUS". 
Field 4:  Provide a full description of each good.  The description should be sufficient to relate it to the invoice description and to the 
Harmonized System (HS) description of the good.  
Field 5:  For each good described in Field 4, identify the HS tariff classification to six digits.  
Field 6:  For each good described in Field 4, state which criterion (1 through 3) is applicable.  The rules of origin are contained in  
Chapter 4 and Annex II of the Agreement. NOTE: In order to be entitled to preferential tariff treatment, each good must 
meet at least one of the criteria below.  
Preference Criteria  
A  The good is "wholly obtained or produced entirely" in the territory of one or more of the Parties, as referred to in Article 4.1 and 
  4.2 of the Agreement. NOTE: The purchase of a good in the territory does not necessarily render it "wholly obtained or  
  produced".  
B  The good is produced entirely in the territory of one or more of the Parties exclusively from originating materials.  All 
  materials used in the production of the good must qualify as "originating" by meeting the rules of Chapter 4 of the Agreement.  
C  The good is produced entirely in the territory of one or more of the Parties and satisfies the specific rule of origin set out in 
Annex II of the Agreement (Specific Rules of Origin) that applies to its tariff classification as referred to in Article 4.2, or the  
provisions under Article 4.12 of the Agreement.  The rule may include a tariff classification change, regional value-content  
requirement and a combination thereof, or specific process requirement.  The good must also satisfy all other applicable  
requirements of Chapter 4 (Rules of Origin) of the Agreement.  
Field 7:  For each good described in Field 4, state "YES" if you are the producer of the good.  If you are not the producer of the good,  
state "NO" followed by (1) or (2), depending on whether this certificate was based upon: (1) your knowledge of whether the 
good qualifies as an originating good; (2) Issued by the producer's written Declaration of Origin, which is completed and  
signed by the producer and voluntarily provided to the exporter by the producer.  
Field 8:  For each good described in Field 4, where the good is subject to a regional value content (RVC) requirement stipulated in the  
Agreement, indicate the percentage.    
Field 9:   Identify the name of the country. ("BN" for all goods originating from Brunei Darussalam, "CL" for all goods originating 
from Chile, "NZ" for all goods originating from New Zealand, "SG" for all goods originating from Singapore)  
Field 10: This field must be completed, signed and dated by the exporter or producer. The date must be the date the Certificate was  
completed and signed.
