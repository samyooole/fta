APPENDIX 1 TO ANNEX VII  
 
SINGAPORE - SCHEDULE OF SPECIFIC COMMITMENTS 
 
EXPLANATORY NOTES 
 
1.  The classification of service sectors in this schedule is based on the 1991 provisional Central Product Classification (CPC) of the United Nations 
Statistical Office unless otherwise indicated by the absence of a CPC number.  The ordering reflects the services sectoral classification list as used in the 
GATT document MTN.GNS/W/120 dated 10 July 1991.  The scheduling of specific commitments follows the guidelines stated in GATT documents 
MTN.GNS/W/164 dated 3 September 1993 and MTN.GNS/W/164/Add.1 dated 30 November 1993.  
 
2.  The use of  “ ** ” against individual CPC codes indicates that the specific commitment for that code shall not extend to the total range of services 
covered under that code.  The entry “Unbound*” means unbound due to lack of technical feasibility.

1 In view of spectrum constraints, parties interested in deploying networks based on wireless technology will be licensed via a tender and/or auction process. 
2 Facilities-based operators are operators that intend to deploy any form of telecommunication networks, systems and facilities to offer telecommunication switching, transmission capacity and services to 
existing licensed telecommunication operators, businesses and consumers. 29 
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          
3 The Info-Communications Development Authority of Singapore (IDA) will consider favourably applications by FBOs  to be designated as PTLs if the FBO commits to substantial infrastructure 
investment and rollout to offer services to a significant proportion of the population within a reasonable time period. In return, a PTL’s network installation process and the maintenance and protection of 
their networks receive special consideration under the Telecommunications Act of 1999. 
4 These networks can have international, nationwide local or selected local coverage. 30 
                                                 
5  Services-based  operators  are  operators  who  lease  telecommunications network elements (i.e. transmission capacity, switching services, ducts, fibre, etc.) from FBO Suppliers to provide 
telecommunication services to third parties or who resell the telecommunications services of FBOs. 
 
 
 
6 Under the class licensing scheme, the licence terms and conditions are gazetted. Anyone who provides the services will be deemed to have read and agreed to the terms and conditions of the class licence. 
They will also be required to register with IDA. 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 45 46 47 48 49 50 51 52 53 54
