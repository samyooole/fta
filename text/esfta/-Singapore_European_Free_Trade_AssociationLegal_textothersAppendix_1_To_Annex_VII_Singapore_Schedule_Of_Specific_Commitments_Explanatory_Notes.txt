APPENDIX 1 TO ANNEX VII   SINGAPORE - SCHEDULE OF SPECIFIC COMMITMENTS  EXPLANATORY NOTES  1. The classification of service sectors in this schedule is based on the 1991 provisional Central Product Classification (CPC) of the United Nations Statistical Office unless otherwise indicated by the absence of a CPC number.  The ordering reflects the services sectoral classification list as used in the GATT document MTN.GNS/W/120 dated 10 July 1991.  The scheduling of specific commitments follows the guidelines stated in GATT documents MTN.GNS/W/164 dated 3 September 1993 and MTN.GNS/W/164/Add.1 dated 30 November 1993.   2. The use of  “ ** ” against individual CPC codes indicates that the specific commitment for that code shall not extend to the total range of services covered under that code.  The entry “Unbound*” means unbound due to lack of technical feasibility.   2  Modes of supply: 1) Cross-border supply 2) Consumption abroad  3) Commercial presence 4) Presence of natural persons Sector or subsector Limitations on market access  Limitations on national treatment Additional commitments  Horizontal Commitments  ALL SECTORS INCLUDED IN THIS SCHEDULE     The specific commitments in a particular services sector or sub-sector shall not be construed to supersede the specific commitments taken with respect to any other services sector or sub-sector to which such service is an input or to which it is otherwise related.     1), 2), 3), 4):   Unbound for subsidies except for specific commitments contained in WTO document GATS/SC/76 (15 April 1994), GATS/SC/76/Suppl.2 (11 April 1997) and GATS/SC/76/Suppl.3 (26 Feb 1998)     3) Commercial presence, right of establishment and movement of juridical persons are subject to compliance with the following provisions: - a foreigner who wishes to register a business firm must have a local manager who should be   a Singapore citizen or a Singapore permanent resident or a Singapore Employment Pass holder.
