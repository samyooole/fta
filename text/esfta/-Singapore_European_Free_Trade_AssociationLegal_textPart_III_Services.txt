ARTICLE 24   Market Access   1.   With respect to market access through the modes of supply identified in  Article 22 (o), each Party shall accord services and service suppliers of another Party treatment no less favourable than that provided for under the terms, limitations and  conditions agreed and specified in its Schedule4.   2.

A Party may meet the requirement in paragraph 1 by according to services and service suppliers of another Party either formally identical treatment or formally different treatment to that it accords to its own like services and service suppliers.   3.   Formally identical or formally different treatment shall be considered to be less favourable if it modifies the conditions of competition in favour of services or service suppliers of a Party compared to like services or service suppliers of another Party.    ARTICLE 26   Additional Commitments   The Parties may negotiate commitments with respect to measures affecting trade in services not subject to scheduling under Articles 24 and 25 above, including those   5 6   Paragraph 2 (c) does not cover measures of a Party which limit inputs for the supply of services.  Specific commitments assumed under this Article shall not be construed to require any Party to comp ensate for any inherent competitive disadvantages which result from the foreign character of the relevant services or services suppliers.  - 19 -    regarding qualifications, standards or licensing matters. Such commitments shall be  entered in a Party’s Schedule.   ARTICLE  27   Trade Liberalisation/Schedule of Specific Commitments   1.

Measures inconsistent with both Articles 24 and 25 shall be inscribed in the  column relating to Article 24.  In this case, the inscription will be considered to provide a condition or qualification to Article 25 as well.   4.   The Parties’ Schedule s of specific commitments are set out in Annex VII, and form an integral part of this Chapter.   5.   The Parties undertake to review their Schedules of specific commitments at least every two years, but earlier if so agreed, with a view to provide for the elimination of substantially all remaining discrimination between the Parties with regard to trade in services covered in this Chapter at the end of a transitional period of ten years from the date of entry into force of this Agreement. Such review shall continue if substantially all remaining discrimination has not been eliminated at the end of this transitional period. This paragraph is not subject to dispute settlement pursuant to Chapter IX.             1.  - 20 -     ARTICLE 28   Domestic Regulation   In sectors where specific commitments are undertaken, each Party shall ensure that all measures of general application affecting trade in services are administered in a reasonable, objective and impartial manner.    2.   Each Party shall maintain or institute as soon as practicable judicial, arbitral or administrative tribunals or procedures which provide, at the request of an affected service supplier of another Party, for the prompt review of, and where justified, appropriate remedies for, administrative decisions affecting trade in services.  Where such procedures are not independent of the agency entrusted with the administrative decision concerned, the Party shall ensure that the procedures in fact provide for an objective and impartial review.   3.   Where authorisation is required for the supply of a service on which a specific commitment has been made, the competent authorities of a Party shall promptly, after the submission of an application considered complete under domestic laws and regulations, inform the applicant of the decision concerning the application.  At the request of the applicant, the competent authorities of the Party shall provide, without undue delay, information concerning the status of the application.   4.   The Parties shall jointly review the results of the negotiations on disciplines for certain regulations, including qualification requirements and procedures, technical  standards and licensing requirements, pursuant to Article VI.4 of the GATS, with a view to their incorporation into this Agreement.  The Parties note that such disciplines aim to ensure that such requirements are inter alia :   (a)  based on objective and transparent criteria, such as competence and the ability to supply the service;   (b)  not more burdensome than necessary to ensure the quality of the service;   (c)  in the case of licensing procedures, not in themselves a restriction on the supply of the service.   5.   In sectors where a Party has undertaken specific commitments, subject to any  terms, limitations, conditions or qualifications set out therein, pending the incorporation of disciplines developed pursuant to paragraph 4, a Party shall not apply licensing and qualification requirements and technical standards that nullify or impair such specific commitments in a manner which:   (a)  does not comply with the criteria outlined in paragraph 4 (a), (b) or (c) and          6.  - 21 -    (b)  could not reasonably have been expected of that Party at the time the specific commitments in those sectors were made.   Whenever a domestic regulation is prepared, adopted and applied in accordance with international standards of relevant international organisations7applied by a Party, there shall be a rebuttable presumption that it complies with the provisions of this Article.    7.   In sectors where specific commitments regarding professional services are  undertaken, each Party shall provide for adequate procedures to verify the competence of professionals of another Party.    ARTICLE 29   Subsidies   A Party which considers that it is adversely affected by a subsidy of another Party may request consultations with that  Party on such matters. Such requests shall be  accorded sympathetic consideration.    ARTICLE 30   Recognition   1.   In principle no later than three years following the entry into force of this  Agreement, the Joint Committee shall establish the necessary steps for the negotiation of agreements or arrangements providing for the mutual recognition of education or  experience obtained, requirements, qualifications, licenses and other regulations, for the purpose of the fulfilment, in whole or in part, by service suppliers of the criteria applied by each Party for the authorisation, licensing, operation and certification of service  suppliers.   2.  Any such recognition conferred by a Party shall be in conformity with the relevant provisions of the WTO and, in particular, Article VII of the GATS.   3.   Where a Party recognises, by agreement or arrangement, the education or  experience obtained, requirements met or licenses or certifications granted in the territory of a non-Party, that Party shall accord another Party, upon request, adequate opportunity to negotiate its accession to such an agreement or arrangement or to negotiate comparable ones with it. Where a Party accords recognition autonomously, it shall afford adequate opportunity for another Party to demonstrate that the education or experience obtained, requirements met or licenses or certifications granted in the territory of that other Party should also be recognised.   7  The term “relevant international organisations” refers to international bodies whose membership is open to the relevant bodies of the Parties.            1.  - 22 -     ARTICLE 31   Monopolies and Exclusive Service Suppliers   Each Party shall ensure that any monopoly supplier of a service in its territory does not, in the supply of the monopoly service in the relevant market, act in a manner inconsistent with the Party’s obligations under its specific commitments.     2.   Where a Party’s monopoly supplier competes, either directly or through an  affiliated company, in the supply of a service outside the scope of its monopoly rights and which is subject to that Party’s obligations under its specific commitments, the Party shall ensure that such a supplier does not abuse its monopoly position to act in its territory in a manner inconsistent with such commitments.     3.   If a Party has reason to believe that a monopoly supplier of a service of another Party is acting in a manner inconsistent with paragraph 1 or 2, it may request that other Party to provide specific information concerning the relevant operations.   4.   The provisions of this Article shall also apply to cases of exclusive service  suppliers, where a Party, formally or in effect, (a) authorises or establishes a small  number of service suppliers and (b) substantially prevents competition among those  suppliers in its territory.    ARTICLE 32  Movement of Natural Persons  1.   This Chapter applies to measures affecting natural persons who are service  suppliers of a Party, and natural persons of a Party who are employed by a service supplier of a Party, in respect of the supply of a service. Natural persons covered by a Party’s specific commitments shall be allowed to supply the service in accordance with the terms of those commitments.   2.   This Chapter shall not apply to measures affecting natural persons seeking access to the employment market of a Party, nor shall it apply to measures regarding citizenship, residence or employment on a permanent basis.   3.   This Chapter shall not prevent a Party from applying measures to regulate the entry of natural persons of another Party into, or their temporary stay in, its territory, including those measures necessary to protect the integrity of, and to ensure the orderly   - 23 -    movement of natural persons across, its borders, provided that such measures are not applied in a manner so as to nullify or impair the benefits accruing to a Party under the terms of a specific commitment8.     ARTICLE 33   General Exceptions   Subject to the requirement that such measures are not applied in a manner which would constitute a means of arbitrary or unjustifiable discrimination between countries where like conditions prevail, or a disguised restriction on trade in services, nothing in this Chapter shall be construed to prevent the adoption or enforcement by any Party of measures:   (a)  necessary to protect public morals or to maintain public order9;   (b)  necessary to protect human, animal or plant life or health;   (c)  necessary to secure compliance with laws or regulations which are not inconsistent with the provisions of this Chapter including those relating to:   (i)   the prevention of deceptive and fraudulent practices or to deal with the effects of a default on services contracts;                  8  9  10  (ii)  the protection of the privacy of individuals in relation to the  processing and dissemination of personal data and the protection of confidentiality of individual records and accounts;    (iii)  safety;   (d)  inconsistent with Article 25, provided that the difference in treatment is aimed at ensuring the equitable or effective10imposition or collection of  direct taxes in respect of services or service suppliers of another Party;    The sole fact of requiring a visa for natural persons of a certain nationality and not for those of others shall not be regarded as nullifying or impairing benefits under a specific commitment.  The public order exception may be invoked only where a genuine and sufficiently serious threat is posed to one of the fundamental interests of society.  Measures that are aimed at ensuring the equitable or effective imposition or collection of direct taxes include measures taken by a Party under its taxation system which:  (i) apply to non-resident service suppliers in recognition of the fact that the tax obligation of non- residents is determined with respect to taxable items sourced or located in the Party's territory; or  (ii) apply to non-residents in order to ensure the imposition or collection of taxes in the Party's territory; or  (iii) apply to non-residents or residents in order to prevent the avoidance or evasion of taxes, including compliance measures; or  - 24 -     (e)  inconsistent with Article 23, provided that the difference in treatment is the result of an agreement on the avoidance of double taxation or  provisions on the avoidance of double taxation in any other international agreement or arrangement by which a Party is bound.    ARTICLE 34   Security Exceptions   Nothing in this Agreement shall be construed:   (a)  to require a Party to furnish or allow access to information the disclosure of which it considers contrary to its essential security interests;   (b)  to prevent a Party from taking any action which it considers necessary for the protection of its essential security interests:  (i)   relating to the supply of services as carried out directly or  indirectly for the purpose of provisioning a military establishment;   (ii)  relating to fissionable and fusionable materials or the materials  from which they are derived;   (iii)  taken in time of war or other emergency in international  relations; or   (c)  to prevent a Party from taking any action in pursuance of its obligations under the United Nations Charter for the maintenance of international  peace and security.           (iv) apply to consumers of services supplied in or from the territory of another Party in order to ensure the imposition or collection of taxes on such consumers derived from sources in the Party’s territory; or  (v) distinguish service suppliers subject to tax on worldwide taxable items from other service suppliers, in recognition of the difference in the nature of the tax base between them; or  (vi) determine, allocate or apportion income, profit, gain, loss, deduction or credit of resident persons or branches, or between related persons or branches of the same person, in order to safeguard the Member's tax base.  Tax terms or concepts in Article 33 (d) and in this footnote are determined according to tax definitions and concepts, or equivalent or similar definitions and concepts, under the domestic law of the Party taking the measure.            1.  - 25 -     ARTICLE 35  Restrictions to Safeguard the Balance-of-Payments   The Parties shall endeavour to avoid the imposition of restrictive measures for balance-of-payments purposes.   2.   Articles XI and XII of the GATS shall apply to payments and transfers, and to restrictions to safeguard the balance-of-payments relating to trade in services.    3.   A Party adopting or maintaining a measure under this Article shall promptly  notify the other Parties and the Joint Committee thereof.
