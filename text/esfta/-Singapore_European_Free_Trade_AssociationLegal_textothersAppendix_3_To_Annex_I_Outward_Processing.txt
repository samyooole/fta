   APPENDIX 3 TO ANNEX I  OUTWARD PROCESSING   1. For the purpose of Article 13 of Annex I the acquisition of originating status shall not be affected by working or processing carried out outside the territory of a Party on materials exported from the Party concerned and subsequently re-imported there, provided that:   (a) for products listed in the Table below, the total value of non-originating input as set out in paragraph 4(a), does not exceed 50 per cent of the ex-works price of the final product for which originating status is claimed, and   (b) for products other than those listed in the Table below, the total added value as set out in paragraph 4(b) does not exceed 10 per cent of the ex-works price of the final product for which originating status is claimed.  2. The materials exported from a Party shall be wholly obtained in the Party concerned or having undergone there working or processing going beyond the insufficient operations listed in Article 6 of Annex I prior to being exported outside the territory of that Party.  It must be demonstrated to the satisfaction of the customs authorities that the re-imported goods have been obtained by working or processing the exported materials.  3. For the purpose of paragraph 1(b), where a rule in Appendix 2 to Annex I restricts or prohibits the use of certain non-originating materials, such a restriction or prohibition shall also apply in respect of working or processing carried out outside the territory of the Party concerned.  Furthermore, where a rule in Appendix 2 to Annex I, giving the maximum value of all the non-originating materials used is applied in determining the originating status of the final product concerned, the total value of the non-originating input as set out in paragraph 4(a) shall not exceed the percentage given.  4. For the purpose of:  (a) paragraphs 1(a) and 3 “total value” shall mean the value of any non-originating materials added inside as well as any materials added and all other cost accumulated outside the Party concerned, including transport costs.  Non-originating materials which have already acquired originating status in a Party shall not be considered as non-originating input.  (b) paragraph 1(b) “total added value” shall mean the value of any materials added outside the Party concerned as well as all costs accumulated outside the territory of the Party concerned, including transport costs.  5. The provisions of paragraphs 2 and 3 shall not apply to products which do not fulfil the conditions set out in Appendix 2 to Annex I and which can be considered sufficiently worked or processed only if the general tolerance given in Article 5(2) of Annex I is applied. -
