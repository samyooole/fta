TITLE II   DEFINITION OF THE CONCEPT “ORIGINATING PRODUCTS”   Article 2  Origin Criteria  For the purpose of this Agreement, the following products shall be considered as originating in a Party:  (a) products wholly obtained in a Party within the meaning of Article 4;  (b) products obtained in a Party incorporating materials which have not been wholly obtained there, provided that such materials have undergone sufficient working or processing in the Party concerned within the meaning of Article 5; or  (c) products obtained in a Party exclusively from materials that qualify as originating pursuant to this Annex.   - 3 -   Article 3  Cumulation of Origin  1. Notwithstanding Article 2, materials originating in another Party within the meaning of this Annex shall be considered as materials originating in the Party concerned, provided that they have undergone working or processing going beyond that referred to in Article 6.  2. Products originating in another Party within the meaning of this Annex, which are exported from one Party to another, shall retain their origin when exported in the same state or without having undergone in the exporting Party working or processing going beyond that referred to in Article 6.  3. For the purpose of paragraph 2, where materials originating in two or more of the Parties are used and those materials have undergone working or processing in the exporting Party not going beyond that referred to in Article 6, the origin is determined by the material with the highest customs value or, if this is not known and cannot be ascertained, with the highest first ascertainable price paid for that material in that Party.   Article 4  Wholly Obtained Products  For the purpose of Article 2(a), the following shall be considered as wholly obtained in a Party:  (a) mineral products extracted from their soil or from their seabed;  (b) vegetable products harvested or gathered there;  (c) live animals born and raised there;  (d) products from live animals raised there;  (e) products obtained by hunting, trapping or fishing conducted there;  (f) products of sea fishing and other products taken from the sea outside the territorial sea of a country by a vessel flying the flag of a Party;  (g) products manufactured on board a factory ship flying the flag of a Party, exclusively from products referred to in sub-paragraph (f);  (h) articles collected there which can no longer perform their original purpose nor are capable of being restored or repaired and are fit only for disposal or recovery of parts or raw materials, including used tyres fit only for retreading;  - 4 -    (i) waste and scrap resulting from consumption or manufacturing operations conducted there, fit only for disposal or recovery of raw materials;  (j) products extracted from the seabed or beneath the seabed outside their territorial sea, provided that they have sole rights to exploit such seabed;   (k) products manufactured there exclusively from products specified in sub-paragraphs (a) to (j).   Article 5  Sufficiently Worked or Processed Products  1. For the purpose of Article 2(b), products which are not wholly obtained are considered to be sufficiently worked or processed when the conditions set out in Appendix 2 are fulfilled.   The conditions referred to above indicate the working or processing which shall be carried out on non-originating materials used in manufacturing and apply only in relation to such materials. Accordingly, it follows that if a product which has acquired originating status, regardless of whether this product has been manufactured in the same factory or in another factory in a Party, by fulfilling the conditions set out in Appendix 2, is used as material in the manufacture of another product, the conditions applicable to such other product do not apply to the product that is used as material, and therefore no account shall be taken of any non-originating materials incorporated into such a product used as a material in the manufacture of another product.  2. Notwithstanding paragraph 1, non-originating materials which, according to the conditions set out in Appendix 2, should not be used in the manufacture of a product may nevertheless be used, provided that:  (a) their total value does not exceed 10 per cent of the ex-works price of the product; and  (b) any of the percentages given in Appendix 2 for the maximum value of non-originating materials are not exceeded through the application of this paragraph.  This paragraph shall not apply to products falling within Chapters 50 to 63 of the Harmonized System.  Appendix 1 shall apply to these products.  3. For the purpose of fulfilling the conditions set out in Appendix 2, the processes may be carried out by one or more producers within one Party.  Supporting documents proving the working or processing shall be maintained by the exporter or the producer of the final product. - 5 -    4. Paragraphs 1 to 3 shall apply except as provided for in Article 6.  - 6 -    Article 6  Insufficient Working or Processing Operations  1. Without prejudice to paragraph 2, the following operations shall be considered as insufficient working or processing to confer the status of originating products, whether or not the requirements of Article 5 are satisfied:   (a) preserving operations to ensure that the products remain in good condition during transport and storage;   (b) breaking-up and assembly of packages;   (c) washing, cleaning; removal of dust, oxide, oil, paint or other coverings;   (d) ironing or pressing of textiles;   (e) simple1  painting and polishing operations;   (f) husking, partial or total bleaching, polishing, and glazing of cereals and rice;   (g) operations to colour sugar or form sugar lumps;   (h) peeling, stoning and shelling, of fruits, nuts and vegetables;   (i) sharpening, simple grinding or simple cutting;   (j) sifting, screening, sorting, classifying, grading, matching; (including the making-up of sets of articles);   (k) simple1  placing in bottles, cans, flasks, bags, cases, boxes, fixing on cards or boards and all other simple packaging operations;   (l) affixing or printing marks, labels, logos and other like distinguishing signs on products or their packaging;    (m) simple mixing2 of products, whether or not of different kinds;                                                  1  “simple”, generally describes activities which need neither special skills nor machines, apparatus or equipment especially produced or installed for carrying out the activity.  2  “simple mixing”, generally describes activities which need neither special skills nor machines, apparatus or equipment especially produced or installed for carrying out the activity. However, simple mixing does not include chemical reaction. Chemical reaction means a process (including a - 7 -     (n) simple3  assembly of parts of articles to constitute a complete article or disassembly of products into parts;   (o) slaughter of animals;   (p) a combination of two or more operations specified in sub-paragraphs (a) to (o).  2. All operations carried out either in a Party on a given product shall be considered together when determining whether the working or processing undergone by that product is to be regarded as insufficient within the meaning of paragraph 1.   Article 7  Unit of Qualification  1. The unit of qualification for the application of the provisions of this Annex shall be the particular product which is considered as the basic unit when determining classification using the nomenclature of the Harmonized System.  Accordingly, it follows that:   (a) when a product composed of a group or assembly of articles is classified under  a single heading, the whole constitutes the unit of qualification; or  (b) when a consignment consists of a number of identical products classified under the same heading, each product shall be taken individually into account when applying the provisions of this Annex.  2. Where, under General Rule 5 of the Harmonized System, packaging is included with the product for classification purposes, it shall be included for the purposes of determining origin.   Article 8  Accessories, Spare Parts and Tools                                                                                                                                                 biochemical process) which results in a molecule with a new structure by breaking intramolecular bonds and by forming new intramolecular bonds, or by altering the spatial arrangement of atoms in a molecule. 3  “simple”, generally describes activities which need neither special skills nor machines, apparatus or equipment especially produced or installed for carrying out the activity. - 8 -   Accessories, spare parts and tools dispatched with a piece of equipment, machine, apparatus or vehicle, which are part of the normal equipment and included in the price thereof or which are not separately invoiced, shall be regarded as one with the piece of equipment, machine, apparatus or vehicle in question.  - 9 -    Article 9  Sets  Sets, as defined in General Rule 3 of the Harmonized System, shall be regarded as originating when all component products are originating. However, when a set is composed of originating and non-originating products, the set as a whole shall be regarded as originating, provided that the value of the non-originating products does not exceed 15 per cent of the ex-works price of the set.   Article 10  Neutral Elements  In order to determine whether a product originates, it shall not be necessary to determine the origin of the following which might be used in its manufacture:  (a) energy and fuel;  (b) plant and equipment, including goods to be used for their maintenance;  (c) machines, tools, dies and moulds; and  (d) any other goods which do not enter into and which are not intended to enter into the final composition of the product.   Article 11  Segregation of Materials  1. Where identical and interchangeable originating and non-originating materials are used in the manufacture of a product, those materials shall be physically segregated, according to their origin, during storage.  Identical and interchangeable materials means materials being of the same kind and commercial quality, possessing the same technical and physical characteristics, and which once they are incorporated into the finished product cannot be distinguished from one another for origin purposes by virtue of any markings etc.  2. A producer facing considerable costs or material difficulties in keeping separate stocks of identical and interchangeable originating and non-originating materials used in the manufacture of a product, may use the so-called “accounting segregation” method for managing stocks. - 10 -    3. The accounting method shall be recorded, applied and maintained in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles applicable in the Party in which the product is manufactured.  The method chosen must:  - permit a clear distinction to be made between originating and non-originating materials acquired and/or kept in stock, and  - guarantee that no more products receive originating status than would be the case if the materials had been physically segregated.  4. The producer using this facilitation shall only complete origin declarations for the quantity of products considered as originating and shall assume full responsibility for the origin declarations and for keeping all documentary evidence of origin of the materials.  At the request of the customs authorities or the competent authority of Singapore, the producer shall provide satisfactory information on how the stocks have been managed.  5. A Party may require that the application of the method for managing stocks as provided for in this Article is subject to prior authorization.     TITLE III  TERRITORIAL REQUIREMENTS   Article 12  Principle of Territoriality  1. Except as provided for in Articles 3 and 13, the conditions for acquiring originating status set out in Title II must be fulfilled without interruption in a Party.  2. Except as provided for in Article 3, an originating product exported from a Party to a non-Party shall where returned be considered as non-originating unless it can be demonstrated to the satisfaction of the customs authority of the importing Party concerned that:   (a) the returning product is the same as that exported; and    (b) the returning product has not undergone any operation beyond that necessary to preserve it in good condition while being exported.   Article 13  - 11 -   Outward Processing  Notwithstanding the provisions of Article 12, the acquisition of originating status in accordance with the conditions set out in Title II shall not be affected by working or processing carried out outside the territory of a Party on materials exported from the Party concerned and subsequently re-imported there, provided that the conditions set out in Appendix 3 are fulfilled.   Article 14  Direct Transport  1. The preferential tariff treatment provided for under this Agreement applies only to products satisfying the requirements of this Annex, which are transported directly between an EFTA State and Singapore.  However, products constituting one single consignment may be transported through other countries with, should the occasion arise, trans-shipment or temporary warehousing in such countries, provided that they remain under the surveillance of the customs authority in the country of transit or warehousing and do not undergo operations other than unloading, reloading or any operation designed to preserve them in good condition.  2.

The customs authority of the importing Party may upon importation of the products concerned require evidence that the products have remained under customs control in the country of exhibition, as well as additional documentary evidences of the conditions under which they have been exhibited, failing which preferential tariff treatment may be refused.  3. An origin declaration shall be completed in accordance with the provisions of Title IV and submitted to the customs authority of the importing Party in the normal manner. The name and address of the exhibition must be indicated thereon.     TITLE IV  PROOF OF ORIGIN   Article 16  Origin Declaration  1.

Article 17  Approved Exporter  1. Where a Party has established an approved exporter programme, the customs authority of an EFTA State or the competent authority of Singapore may authorize an exporter of that Party that makes frequent shipments of originating products under this Agreement to complete an origin declaration without signature, on condition that he gives the customs authority of the exporting Party or the competent authority of Singapore a written undertaking that he accepts full responsibility for any origin declaration which identifies him as if it had been signed in manuscript by him.  2. The customs authority of the exporting Party or the competent authority of Singapore shall provide to the approved exporter referred to in paragraph 1 a customs authorization number or other form of identification as may be agreed by the customs authorities of the Parties or the competent authority of Singapore for use on the origin declaration instead of the signature of the exporter.  3. The customs authority of the exporting Party or the competent authority of Singapore may verify the proper use of an authorization as referred to in paragraph 1 and may at any time withdraw the authorization if the exporter no longer meets the conditions or otherwise makes improper use of the authorization.
