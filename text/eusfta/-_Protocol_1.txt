includes the value of all the materials used and all other costs related to its production, 
minus any internal taxes which are, or may be, repaid when the product obtained is 
exported. 
 
Where the actual price paid does not reflect all costs related to the manufacturing of the 
product which are actually incurred in the Union or in Singapore, the ex-works price means 
the sum of all those costs, minus any internal taxes which are, or may be, repaid when the 
product obtained is exported;

subcontracted to a manufacturer, the term "manufacturer" may refer to the enterprise that has 
employed the subcontractor. 
 
 
SECTION 2 
 
DEFINITION OF THE CONCEPT OF "ORIGINATING PRODUCTS" 
 
 
ARTICLE 2 
 
General Requirements 
 
For the purposes of this Agreement, the following products shall be considered as originating in a 
Party: 
 
(a)  products wholly obtained in a Party within the meaning of Article 4; and 
 
 
EUSFTA Protocol 1 - 7  
(b)  products obtained in a Party incorporating materials which have not been wholly obtained 
there, provided that such materials have undergone sufficient working or processing in the 
Party concerned within the meaning of Article 5. 
 
 
ARTICLE 3 
 
Cumulation of Origin 
 
1.  Notwithstanding Article 2 (General Requirements), products shall be considered as 
originating in a Party if such products are obtained there by incorporating materials originating in 
the other Party, provided that the working or processing carried out goes beyond the operations 
referred to in Article 6 (Insufficient Working or Processing). It shall not be necessary that the 
materials of the other Party have undergone sufficient working or processing. 
 
2.  Materials originating in an ASEAN country which is applying with the Union a preferential 
agreement in accordance with Article XXIV of the GATT 1994, shall be considered as materials 
originating in a Party when incorporated in a product obtained in that Party, provided that they 
have undergone working or processing in that Party which goes beyond the operations referred to 
in Article 6 (Insufficient Working or Processing). 
 
3.  For the purposes of paragraph 2, the origin of the materials shall be determined according to 
the rules of origin applicable in the framework of the Union's preferential agreements with those 
countries. 
 
 
EUSFTA Protocol 1 - 8  
4.  For the purposes of paragraph 2, the originating status of materials exported from one of 
the ASEAN countries to a Party to be used in further working or processing shall be established by 
a proof of origin under which these materials could be exported directly to the Union. 
 
5.  The cumulation provided for in paragraphs 2 to 7 may only be applied provided that: 
 
(a)  the ASEAN countries involved in the acquisition of the originating status have undertaken to: 
 
(i)  comply or ensure compliance with this Protocol; and 
 
(ii)  provide the administrative cooperation necessary to ensure the correct 
implementation of this Protocol both with regard to the Union and among themselves; 
 
(b)  the undertakings referred to in subparagraph (a) have been notified to the Union. 
 
6.  Origin declarations issued by application of paragraph 4 shall bear one of the following 
entries: 
 
(a)  "Application of Article 3(2) of Protocol 1 of the EU/Singapore FTA"; or 
 
(b)  "Application du paragraphe 2 de l'article 3 du protocole nÂ° 1 de l'ALE UE/Singapour". 
 
 
EUSFTA Protocol 1 - 9  
7.  The materials listed in Annex C to this Protocol shall be excluded from the cumulation 
provided for in paragraphs 2 to 6 where at the time of importation of the product: 
 
(a)  the tariff preference applicable to the materials in a Party is not the same for all the 
countries involved in the cumulation; and 
 
(b)  the materials concerned would benefit, through cumulation, from a tariff treatment more 
favourable than the one they would benefit from if directly exported to a Party. 
 
8.  At the request of a Party, the Parties, by decision in the Committee on Customs established 
pursuant to Article 16.2 (Specialised Committees), may modify Annex C to this Protocol. Any 
request for such a modification shall be communicated to the other Party at least two months 
before the meeting of that Committee. 
 
9.  Materials originating in an ASEAN country shall be considered as materials originating in a 
Party when further processed or incorporated into one of the products listed in Annex D to this 
Protocol obtained there, provided that they have undergone working or processing in that Party 
which goes beyond the operations referred to in Article 6 (Insufficient Working or Processing). 
 
10.  For the purposes of paragraph 9, the origin of the materials shall be determined according to 
the preferential rules of origin applicable to General System of Preferences (hereinafter referred 
to as "GSP") beneficiary countries which are laid down in Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) 
2015/24461. 
 
                                                 
1  Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) 2015/2446 of 28 July 2015 supplementing Regulation (EU) No 952/2013 
of the European Parliament and of the Council as regards detailed rules concerning certain provisions of the 
Union Customs Code (OJ EU L 343, 29.12.2015, p. 1). 
 
EUSFTA Protocol 1 - 10  
11.  For the purposes of paragraph 9, the originating status of materials exported from one of 
the ASEAN countries to a Party to be used in further working or processing shall be established by 
a proof of origin in accordance with the preferential rules applicable to GSP beneficiary countries 
as laid down in Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) 2015/2446. 
 
12.  The cumulation provided for in paragraphs 9 to 13 may only be applied on the condition 
that: 
 
(a)  the ASEAN countries involved in the acquisition of the originating status have undertaken to: 
 
(i)  comply or ensure compliance with this Protocol; and 
 
(ii)  provide the administrative cooperation necessary to ensure the correct 
implementation of this Protocol both with regard to the Union and between 
themselves; 
 
(b)  the undertakings referred to in subparagraph (a) have been notified to the Union. 
 
13.  Origin declarations issued by application of paragraph 9 shall bear one of the following

pursuant to Article 16.2 (Specialised Committees), may modify Annex D to this Protocol. Any 
request for such a modification shall be communicated to the other Party at least two months 
before the meeting of the Committee. 
 
15.  The cumulation provided for in paragraph 9 to 13 shall cease to apply when conditions of 
paragraphs 2 to 7 are met.

(a)  mineral products extracted from their soil or from their seabed; 
 
(b)  plants and vegetable products grown or harvested there; 
 
(c)  live animals born and raised there;

(e)  products from slaughtered animals born and raised there; 
 
 
EUSFTA Protocol 1 - 12  
(f)  products obtained by hunting or fishing conducted there;

2.  The terms "their vessels" and "their factory ships" in subparagraphs 1(h) and 1(i) shall apply 
only to vessels and factory ships: 
 
(a)  which are registered in a Member State of the Union or in Singapore; 
 
 
EUSFTA Protocol 1 - 13  
(b)  which sail under the flag of a Member State of the Union or of Singapore; and 
 
(c)  which meet one of the following conditions: 
 
(i)  they are at least fifty percent owned by nationals of a Member State of the Union or of 
Singapore; 
 
or 
 
(ii)  they are owned by companies: 
 
(1)  which have their head office and their main place of business in a Member State

ARTICLE 5 
 
Sufficiently Worked or Processed Products 
 
1.  For the purposes of subparagraph (b) of Article 2 (General Requirements), products which 
are not wholly obtained are considered to be sufficiently worked or processed when the 
conditions set out in the list in Annex B or B(a) to this Protocol are fulfilled. 
 
 
EUSFTA Protocol 1 - 14  
2.  The conditions referred to above indicate, for all products covered by this Agreement, the 
working or processing which must be carried out on non-originating materials used in 
manufacturing, and apply only in relation to such materials. It follows that if a product which has 
acquired originating status by fulfilling the conditions set out in the list in Annex B or B(a) to this 
Protocol is used in the manufacture of another product, the conditions applicable to the product 
in which it is incorporated do not apply to the product that acquired originating status, and no 
account shall be taken of the non-originating materials which may have been used in its 
manufacture. 
 
3.  By way of derogation from paragraph 1 and subject to paragraphs 4 and 5, non-originating 
materials which, according to the conditions set out in the list in Annex B or B(a) to this Protocol, 
are not to be used in the manufacture of a given product may nevertheless be used, provided that 
their total value or net weight assessed for the product does not exceed: 
 
(a)  ten percent of the weight of the product for products falling within Chapters 2 and 4 to 24 of 
the Harmonized System, other than processed fishery products of Chapter 16; 
 
(b)  ten percent of the ex-works price of the product for other products, except for products 
falling within Chapters 50 to 63 of the Harmonized System, for which the tolerances 
mentioned in Notes 6 and 7 of Annex A to this Protocol, shall apply. 
 
4.  Paragraph 3 shall not be construed to allow any of the percentages for the maximum 
content of non-originating materials as specified in the list in Annex B to this Protocol to be 
exceeded. 
 
 
EUSFTA Protocol 1 - 15  
5.  Paragraphs 3 and 4 do not apply to products wholly obtained in a Party within the meaning 
of Article 4 (Wholly Obtained Products). However, without prejudice to Article 6 (Insufficient 
Working or Processing) and paragraph 2 of Article 7 (Unit of Qualification) the tolerance provided 
for in those paragraphs shall nevertheless apply to the sum of all the materials which are used in 
the manufacture of a product and for which the rule for that product laid down in the list in Annex 
B to this Protocol requires that such materials be wholly obtained. 
 
 
ARTICLE 6 
 
Insufficient Working or Processing 
 
1.  Without prejudice to paragraph 2, the following operations shall be considered as 
insufficient working or processing to confer the status of originating products, whether or not the 
requirements of Article 5 (Sufficiently Worked or Processed Products) are satisfied: 
 
(a)  preserving operations to ensure that the products remain in good condition during transport 
and storage; 
 
(b)  the breaking-up and assembly of packages; 
 
(c)  the washing, cleaning; removal of dust, oxide, oil, paint or other coverings;

(j)  sifting, screening, sorting, classifying, grading, matching (including the making-up of sets of 
articles); 
 
(k)  simple placing in bottles, cans, flasks, bags, cases, boxes, fixing on cards or boards and all 
other simple packaging operations; 
 
(l)  the affixing or printing of marks, labels, logos and other like distinguishing signs on products 
or their packaging; 
 
(m)  the simple mixing of products, whether or not of different kinds; mixing of sugar with any 
material; 
 
(n)  the simple addition of water to or the dilution, dehydration or denaturation of products; 
 
 
EUSFTA Protocol 1 - 17  
(o)  the simple assembly of parts of articles to constitute a complete article or the disassembly of 
products into parts; 
 
(p)  a combination of two or more of the operations specified in subparagraphs (a) to (o); or 
 
(q)  the slaughter of animals. 
 
2.  For the purpose of paragraph 1, operations shall be considered simple when no special skills 
or machines, apparatus or tools that were especially produced or installed for those operations 
are required for their performance. 
 
3.  All operations on a given product carried out either in the Union or in Singapore shall be 
considered together when determining whether the working or processing undergone by that 
product is to be regarded as insufficient within the meaning of paragraph 1. 
 
 
ARTICLE 7 
 
Unit of Qualification 
 
1.  The unit of qualification for the application of the provisions of this Protocol shall be the 
product which is considered as the basic unit when determining classification using the 
nomenclature of the Harmonized System. 
 
 
EUSFTA Protocol 1 - 18  
2.  When a consignment consists of a number of identical products classified under the same 
heading of the Harmonized System, each individual item shall be taken into account when 
applying the provisions of this Protocol. 
 
Where, under General Interpretative Rule 5 of the Harmonized System, packaging is included with 
the product for classification purposes, the packaging shall be included for the purposes of 
determining origin. 
 
 
ARTICLE 8 
 
Accessories, Spare Parts and Tools 
 
Accessories, spare parts and tools dispatched with a piece of equipment, machine, apparatus or 
vehicle, which are part of the normal equipment and included in the price thereof or which are not 
separately invoiced, shall be regarded as one with the piece of equipment, machine, apparatus or 
vehicle in question. 
 
 
 
EUSFTA Protocol 1 - 19  
ARTICLE 9 
 
Sets 
 
Sets, as defined in General Interpretative Rule 3 of the Harmonized System, shall be regarded as 
originating when all component products are originating products. When a set is composed of 
originating and non-originating products, the set as a whole shall be regarded as originating, 
provided that the value of the non-originating products does not exceed fifteen percent of the ex-
works price of the set. 
 
 
ARTICLE 10 
 
Neutral Elements 
 
In order to determine whether a product originates in a Party, it shall not be necessary to 
determine the origin of the following elements which might be used in its manufacture: 
 
(a)  energy and fuel; 
 
(b)  plant and equipment, including goods to be used for their maintenance; 
 
 
EUSFTA Protocol 1 - 20

inspecting the good; catalysts and solvents; and 
 
(d)  other goods which do not enter, and which are not intended to enter, into the final 
composition of the product. 
 
 
ARTICLE 11 
 
Accounting Segregation 
 
1.  If originating and non-originating fungible materials are used in the working or processing of 
a product, the competent governmental authorities, at the written request of economic operators, 
may authorise the management of materials using the accounting segregation method without 
keeping the materials in separate stocks. 
 
2.  The competent governmental authorities may make the granting of the authorisation 
referred to in paragraph 1 subject to any conditions they deem appropriate. 
 
 
EUSFTA Protocol 1 - 21  
3.  The authorisation shall be granted only if it can be ensured by use of the accounting 
segregation method that, at any given time, the number of products obtained which could be 
considered as originating in the Union or in Singapore is the same as the number that would have 
been obtained by using a method of physical segregation of the stocks. 
 
4.  If authorised, the accounting segregation method, for example, averaging, last-in, first-out, 
or first-in, first-out, shall be applied and the method used shall be recorded on the basis of the 
general accounting principles applicable in the Union or in Singapore, depending on where the 
product is manufactured. 
 
5.  A manufacturer using the accounting segregation method shall make out or apply for origin 
declarations for the quantity of products which may be considered as originating in the exporting 
Party. At the request of the customs authorities or competent governmental authorities of the 
exporting Party, the beneficiary shall provide a statement of how the quantities have been 
managed. 
 
6.  The competent governmental authorities shall monitor the use made of the authorisations 
referred to in paragraph 3 and may withdraw them if a manufacturer makes improper use of the 
authorisation or fails to fulfil any of the other conditions laid down in this Protocol.

1.  The conditions set out in Section 2 relating to the acquisition of originating status must be 
fulfilled without interruption in a Party. 
 
2.  If originating goods exported from a Party to a non-Party return, they must be considered as 
non-originating goods, unless it can be demonstrated to the satisfaction of the customs authorities 
that: 
 
(a)  the returning goods are the same as those exported; and 
 
(b)  they have not undergone any operation beyond that necessary to preserve them in good 
condition while in that non-Party or while being exported.

out by the exporter or under his responsibility provided they remain under customs supervision in 
the country(ies) of transit. 
 
4.  Compliance with paragraphs 1 to 3 shall be considered as satisfied unless the customs 
authorities have reason to believe the contrary; in such cases, the customs authorities may 
request the declarant to provide evidence of compliance, which may be given by any means, 
including contractual transport documents such as bills of lading or factual or concrete evidence 
based on marking or numbering of packages or any evidence related to the goods themselves. 
 
 
 
EUSFTA Protocol 1 - 24  
ARTICLE 14 
 
Exhibitions 
 
1.  Originating products, sent for exhibition in a country other than a Party and sold after the 
exhibition for importation in a Party shall benefit on importation from the provisions of this

provisions of Section 5, shall not be subject in the Union or in Singapore to drawback of, or 
exemption from, customs duties of whatever kind. 
 
2.  The prohibition in paragraph 1 shall apply to any arrangement for refund, remission or non-
payment, whether partial or complete, of customs duties or charges having an equivalent effect, 
applicable in the Union or in Singapore to materials used in the manufacture, where such refund, 
remission or non-payment applies, whether expressly or in effect, where the products obtained 
from such materials are exported, but not where they are retained in a Party for home use. 
 
 
EUSFTA Protocol 1 - 26  
3.  The exporter of products covered by an origin declaration shall be prepared to submit at any 
time, upon request from the customs authorities, all appropriate documents to prove that no

EUSFTA Protocol 1 - 29  
3.  The exporter making out an origin declaration shall be prepared at all times to submit, at the 
request of the customs authorities of the exporting Party, all appropriate documents as referred 
to under Article 23 (Supporting Documents) proving the originating status of the products

necessary to verify the originating status of the products as well as the fulfilment of the other 
requirements of this Protocol.

approved exporter subject to any conditions which they consider appropriate. 
 
3.  The customs authorities of the Member States of the Union shall grant to the approved 
exporter a customs authorisation number which shall appear on the origin declaration. 
 
4.  The customs authorities of the Member States of the Union shall monitor the use of the 
authorisation by the approved exporter.

Importation in Instalments 
 
Where, at the request of the importer and on the conditions laid down by the customs authorities 
of the importing Party, dismantled or non-assembled products within the meaning of General 
Rule 2(a) of the Harmonized System falling within Sections XVI and XVII or headings 7308 and 9406

Exemptions from Origin Declaration 
 
1.  Products which are sent as small packages from private persons to private persons, or which 
form part of travellers' personal luggage, shall be admitted as originating products without 
requiring the submission of an origin declaration, provided that such products are not imported by 
way of trade and have been declared as meeting the requirements of this Protocol, and provided 
that there is no doubt as to the veracity of such a declaration. In the case of products sent by post, 
this declaration can be made on the customs declaration CN22/CN23 or on a sheet of paper 
annexed to that document. 
 
 
EUSFTA Protocol 1 - 33  
2.  Imports which are occasional and consist solely of products for the personal use of the 
recipients or of travellers or their families shall not be considered as imports by way of trade if it is 
evident from the nature and quantity of the products that no commercial purpose is intended.

Discrepancies and Formal Errors 
 
1.  The discovery of slight discrepancies between the statements made in the origin declaration 
and those made in the documents submitted to the customs office for the purposes of carrying 
out the formalities for importing the products shall not ipso facto render the origin declaration null 
and void if it is duly established that that document corresponds to the products submitted. 
 
 
EUSFTA Protocol 1 - 35  
2.  Obvious formal errors such as typing errors on a origin declaration should not cause the 
document to be rejected if those errors are not such as to create doubts concerning the 
correctness of the statements made in the document. 
 
 
ARTICLE 26 
 
Amounts Expressed in Euro 
 
1.  For the application of the provisions of subparagraph 1(a)(ii) of Article 17 (Conditions for 
Making Out an Origin Declaration) and paragraph 3 of Article 22 (Exemptions from Origin 
Declaration) in cases where products are invoiced in a currency other than euro, amounts in the 
national currencies of the Member States of the Union equivalent to the amounts expressed in 
euro shall be fixed annually by each of the countries concerned. 
 
2.  A consignment shall benefit from the provisions of subparagraph 1(a)(ii) of Article 17 
(Conditions for Making Out an Origin Declaration) and paragraph 3 of Article 22 (Exemptions from 
Origin Declaration) by reference to the currency in which the invoice is drawn up, according to the 
amount fixed by the Party concerned. 
 
3.  The amounts to be used in any given national currency shall be the equivalent in that 
currency of the amounts expressed in euro as at the first working day of October. The amounts 
shall be communicated to the European Commission by 15 October and shall apply from 1 January 
the following year. The European Commission shall notify all countries concerned of the relevant 
amounts. 
 
 
EUSFTA Protocol 1 - 36  
4.  A Member State of the Union may round up or down the amount resulting from the 
conversion into its national currency of an amount expressed in euro. The rounded amount may 
not differ from the amount resulting from the conversion by more than five percent. A Member 
State of the Union may retain unchanged its national currency equivalent of an amount expressed 
in euro if, at the time of the annual adjustment provided for in paragraph 3, the conversion of that 
amount, prior to any rounding-off, results in an increase of less than fifteen percent in the national 
currency equivalent. The national currency equivalent may be retained unchanged if the 
conversion would result in a decrease in that equivalent value. 
 
5.  The amounts expressed in euro shall be reviewed by the Parties in the Committee on 
Customs established pursuant to Article 16.2 (Specialised Committees) at the request of the Union 
or of Singapore. When carrying out this review, the Parties shall consider the desirability of 
preserving the effects of the limits concerned in real terms. For these purposes, the Parties may, 
by decision in the Committee on Customs, modify the amounts expressed in euro.

Commission, with the addresses of the customs authorities responsible for verifying the origin 
declarations. 
 
2.  In order to ensure the proper application of this Protocol, the Parties shall assist each other, 
through their competent authorities, in checking the authenticity of origin declarations and the 
correctness of the information given in such documents. 
 
 
ARTICLE 28 
 
Verification of Origin Declarations 
 
1.  Subsequent verifications of origin declarations shall be carried out at random or whenever 
the customs authorities of the importing Party have reasonable doubts as to the authenticity of 
such documents, the originating status of the products concerned or the fulfilment of the other 
requirements of this Protocol. 
 
 
EUSFTA Protocol 1 - 38  
2.  For the purposes of implementing the provisions of paragraph 1, if it has been submitted, 
the customs authorities of the importing Party shall return the origin declaration, or a copy of that 
document, to the customs authorities of the exporting Party giving, where appropriate, the 
reasons for the enquiry. Any document and information obtained suggesting that the information 
given on the origin declarations is incorrect shall be forwarded in support of the request for 
verification. 
 
3.  The verification shall be carried out by the customs authorities of the exporting Party. For 
this purpose, they shall have the right to request any evidence and to carry out any inspection of 
the exporter's accounts or any other check considered appropriate. 
 
4.  If the customs authorities of the importing Party decide to suspend the granting of 
preferential treatment to the products concerned while awaiting the results of the verification, the 
release of the products shall be offered to the importer, subject to any precautionary measures 
judged necessary. Any suspension of preferential treatment shall be reinstated as soon as possible 
after the originating status of the products concerned or the fulfilment of the other requirements 
of this Protocol has been ascertained by the customs authorities of the importing Party. 
 
5.  The customs authorities requesting the verification shall be informed of the results of this 
verification as soon as possible. These results must indicate clearly whether the documents are 
authentic and whether the products concerned can be considered as products originating in the 
Parties and fulfil the other requirements of this Protocol. 
 
 
EUSFTA Protocol 1 - 39  
6.  If, in cases of reasonable doubt, there is no reply within ten months of the date of the 
verification request or the reply does not contain sufficient information to allow the requesting 
customs authorities to determine the authenticity of the document in question or the real origin 
of the products, the requesting customs authorities, except in exceptional circumstances, shall 
refuse entitlement to the preferences. 
 
 
ARTICLE 29 
 
Administrative Enquiries 
 
1.  Where the results of the verification procedure or any other available substantive 
information appear to indicate that the provisions of this Protocol are being contravened, the 
exporting Party, on its own initiative or at the request of the other Party, shall carry out 
appropriate enquiries or arrange for such enquiries to be carried out with due urgency to identify 
and prevent such contraventions. The results of such enquiries shall be communicated to the Party 
requesting verification. 
 
2.  The Party requesting verification may be present at the enquiries, subject to conditions that 
may be laid down by the competent authority in the exporting Party. 
 
 
EUSFTA Protocol 1 - 40  
3.  Where a Party has made a finding, on the basis of objective information, of a repeated 
failure2 to provide administrative cooperation under this Section, or of systematic and intentional 
fraud from the other Party, the Party concerned may temporarily suspend the relevant 
preferential treatment of the product or products concerned in accordance with paragraph 4. 
 
4.  The application of a temporary suspension shall be subject to the following conditions: 
 
(a)  the Party which has made a finding in accordance with paragraph 3 shall without undue 
delay notify the Trade Committee established pursuant to Article 16.1 (Trade Committee) of 
its finding together with the objective information and its recommended course of action to 
be taken. Upon receipt of such notification, the Trade Committee shall deliberate on the 
appropriate course of action on the basis of all relevant information and objective findings, 
with a view to reaching a solution acceptable to both Parties. During the period of 
consultations referred to above, the product(s) concerned shall enjoy the preferential 
treatment; 
 
(b)  where the Parties have entered into consultations with the Trade Committee and have failed 
to agree on an acceptable solution within three months following the notification, the Party 
concerned may temporarily suspend the relevant preferential treatment of the product(s) 
concerned in so far as is strictly necessary to address the Party's concerns. Such temporary 
suspension shall be notified to the Trade Committee without undue delay; 
 
                                                 
2  For the purposes of paragraph 3 of Article 29 (Administrative Enquiries), a repeated failure to provide 
administrative cooperation shall mean, inter alia, a repeated failure to respect the obligations to verify the 
originating status of the product(s) concerned, or a repeated refusal or undue delay in carrying out and/or 
communicating the results of enquiries and/or subsequent verification of the proof of origin, over a continuous 
period of ten months. 
 
EUSFTA Protocol 1 - 41  
(c)  temporary suspensions under this Article shall be commensurate with the impact on the 
financial interests of the Party concerned arising from the situation giving rise to the finding 
of the Party referred to paragraph 3. They shall not exceed a period of six months, which 
may be renewed, if at the date of expiry nothing substantive has changed with respect to the 
condition that gave rise to the initial suspension; and 
 
(d)  temporary suspensions, and any renewal thereof, shall be notified immediately after their 
adoption to the Trade Committee. They shall be subject to periodic consultations within the 
Trade Committee, in particular with a view to their termination as soon as the conditions for 
their application no longer apply.

Origin Declarations) which cannot be settled between the competent authorities requesting a 
verification and the competent authorities responsible for carrying out this verification, or where 
they raise a question as to the interpretation of this Protocol, they shall be submitted to the 
Committee on Customs established pursuant to Article 16.2 (Specialised Committees).

EUSFTA Protocol 1 - 47  
ANNEX A 
 
 
INTRODUCTORY NOTES TO THE LIST IN ANNEX B 
 
Note 1 â General introduction 
 
The list sets out the conditions required for all products to be considered as sufficiently worked or 
processed within the meaning of Article 5 (Sufficiently Worked or Processed Products) of the 
Protocol. There are four different types of rule, which vary according to the product: 
 
(a)  through working or processing, a maximum content of non-originating materials is not 
exceeded; 
 
(b)  through working or processing, the applicable 4-digit Harmonized System heading or 6-digit 
Harmonized System sub-heading for the manufactured products becomes different from the 
respective 4-digit Harmonized System heading or 6-digit sub-heading for the materials used; 
 
(c)  a specific working and processing operation is carried out; and 
 
(d)  working or processing is carried out on certain wholly-obtained materials. 
 
 
EUSFTA Protocol 1 - 48  
Note 2 â The structure of the list 
 
2.1.  The first two columns in the list describe the product obtained. The first column gives the 
heading number or chapter number used in the Harmonized System and the second column 
gives the description of goods used in that system for that heading or chapter. For each 
entry in the first two columns, a rule is specified in column 3. Where, in some cases, the 
entry in the first column is preceded by an "ex", this signifies that the rules in column 3 apply 
only to the part of that heading as described in column 2. 
 
2.2.  Where several heading numbers are grouped together in column 1, or a chapter number is 
given and the description of products in column 2 is therefore given in general terms, the 
adjacent rules in column 3 apply to all products which, under the Harmonized System, are 
classified in headings of the chapter or in any of the headings grouped together in column 1. 
 
2.3.  Where there are different rules in the list applying to different products within a heading, 
each indent contains the description of that part of the heading covered by the adjacent 
rules in column 3. 
 
2.4.  Where two alternative rules are set out in column 3, separated by "or", it is at the choice of 
the exporter which one to use. 
 
 
EUSFTA Protocol 1 - 49  
Note 3 â Examples of how to apply the rules 
 
3.1.  Article 5 (Sufficiently Worked or Processed Products) of the Protocol, concerning products 
having acquired originating status which are used in the manufacture of other products, 
shall apply, regardless of whether this status has been acquired inside the factory where 
these products are used or in another factory in a Party. 
 
3.2.  Pursuant to Article 6 (Insufficient Working or Processing) of the Protocol, the working or 
processing carried out must go beyond the list of operations mentioned in that Article. If it 
does not, the goods shall not qualify for the granting of the benefit of preferential tariff 
treatment, even if the conditions set out in the list below are met. 
 
Subject to the provision referred to in the first sub-paragraph, the rules in the list represent 
the minimum amount of working or processing required, and the carrying-out of more 
working or processing also confers originating status; conversely, the carrying-out of less 
working or processing cannot confer originating status. 
 
Thus, if a rule provides that non-originating material may be used at a certain stage of 
manufacture, the use of such material at an earlier stage of manufacture is allowed, and the 
use of such material at a later stage is not. 
 
If a rule provides that non-originating material, at a certain level of manufacture, may not be 
used, the use of materials at an earlier stage of manufacture is allowed, and the use of 
materials at a later stage is not. 
 
 
EUSFTA Protocol 1 - 50  
Example: when the list-rule for Chapter 19 requires that "non-originating materials of 
headings 1101 to 1108 cannot exceed 20 per cent weight", the use (i.e. importation) of 
cereals of Chapter 10 (materials at an earlier stage of manufacture) is not limited. 
 
3.3.  Without prejudice to Note 3.2, where a rule uses the expression "Manufacture from 
materials of any heading", then materials of any heading(s) (even materials of the same 
description and heading as the product) may be used, subject, however, to any specific 
limitations which may also be contained in the rule. 
 
The expression "Manufacture from materials of any heading, including other materials of 
heading [...]" or "Manufacture from materials of any heading, including other materials of 
the same heading as the product" means that materials of any heading(s) may be used, 
except those of the same description as the product as given in column 2 of the list. 
 
3.4.  When a rule in the list specifies that a product may be manufactured from more than one 
material, this means that one or more materials may be used. It does not require that all be 
used. 
 
3.5.  Where a rule in the list specifies that a product must be manufactured from a particular 
material, the rule does not prevent the use of other materials which, because of their 
inherent nature, cannot satisfy this condition. 
 
 
EUSFTA Protocol 1 - 51  
3.6.  Where a rule in the list gives two percentages for the maximum value of non-originating 
materials that can be used, those percentages may not be added together. In other words, 
the maximum value of all the non-originating materials used may never exceed the higher of 
the percentages given. Furthermore, the individual percentages must not be exceeded in 
relation to the particular materials to which they apply. 
 
Note 4 â General provisions concerning certain agricultural goods 
 
4.1.  Agricultural goods which fall within Chapters 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 12 and heading 2401, and which 
are grown or harvested in the territory of a beneficiary country, shall be treated as 
originating in the territory of that country, even if grown from seeds, bulbs, rootstock, 
cuttings, grafts, shoots, buds, or other live parts of plants imported from another country. 
 
4.2.  In cases where the content of non originating sugar in a given product is subject to 
limitations, the weight of sugars of headings 1701 (sucrose) and 1702 (e.g., fructose, glucose, 
lactose, maltose, isoglucose or invert sugar) used in the manufacture of the final product and 
used in the manufacture of the non-originating products incorporated in the final product is 
taken into account for the calculation of such limitations. 
 
Note 5 - Terminology used in respect of certain textile products 
 
5.1.  The term "natural fibres" is used in the list to refer to fibres other than artificial or synthetic 
fibres. It is restricted to the stages before spinning takes place, including waste, and, unless 
otherwise specified, includes fibres which have been carded, combed or otherwise 
processed, but not spun. 
 
 
EUSFTA Protocol 1 - 52  
5.2.  The term "natural fibres" includes horsehair of heading 0511, silk of headings 5002 
and 5003, as well as wool-fibres and fine or coarse animal hair of headings 5101 to 5105, 
cotton fibres of headings 5201 to 5203, and other vegetable fibres of headings 5301 to 5305. 
 
5.3.  The terms "textile pulp", "chemical materials" and "paper-making materials" are used in the 
list to describe the materials which are not classified in Chapters 50 to 63, but which can be 
used to manufacture artificial, synthetic or paper fibres or yarns. 
 
5.4.  The term "man-made staple fibres" is used in the list to refer to synthetic or artificial 
filament tow, staple fibres or waste, of headings 5501 to 5507. 
 
Note 6 - Tolerances applicable to products made of a mixture of textile materials 
 
6.1.  Where, for a given product in the list, reference is made to this Note, the conditions set out 
in column 3 shall not be applied to any basic textile materials used in the manufacture of this 
product and which, taken together, represent 10 % or less of the total weight of all the basic 
textile materials used. (See also Notes 6.3 and 6.4). 
 
6.2.  The tolerance mentioned in Note 6.1 may be applied only to mixed products which have 
been made from two or more basic textile materials. 
 
The following are the basic textile materials: 
 
â  silk; 
 
 
EUSFTA Protocol 1 - 53  
â  wool; 
 
â  coarse animal hair; 
 
â  fine animal hair; 
 
â  horsehair; 
 
â  cotton; 
 
â  paper-making materials and paper; 
 
â  flax; 
 
â  true hemp; 
 
â  jute and other textile bast fibres; 
 
â  sisal and other textile fibres of the genus Agave; 
 
â  coconut, abaca, ramie and other vegetable textile fibres; 
 
â  synthetic man-made filaments; 
 
â  artificial man-made filaments; 
 
â  current-conducting filaments; 
 
 
EUSFTA Protocol 1 - 54  
â  synthetic man-made staple fibres of polypropylene; 
 
â  synthetic man-made staple fibres of polyester; 
 
â  synthetic man-made staple fibres of polyamide; 
 
â  synthetic man-made staple fibres of polyacrylonitrile; 
 
â  synthetic man-made staple fibres of polyimide; 
 
â  synthetic man-made staple fibres of polytetrafluoroethylene; 
 
â  synthetic man-made staple fibres of poly(phenylene sulphide); 
 
â  synthetic man-made staple fibres of poly(vinyl chloride); 
 
â  other synthetic man-made staple fibres; 
 
â  artificial man-made staple fibres of viscose; 
 
â  other artificial man-made staple fibres; 
 
 
EUSFTA Protocol 1 - 55  
â  yarn made of polyurethane segmented with flexible segments of polyether, whether or 
not gimped; 
 
â  yarn made of polyurethane segmented with flexible segments of polyester, whether or 
not gimped; 
 
â  products of heading 5605 (metallised yarn) incorporating strip consisting of a core of 
aluminium foil or of a core of plastic film whether or not coated with aluminium 
powder, of a width not exceeding 5 mm, sandwiched by means of a transparent or 
coloured adhesive between two layers of plastic film; 
 
â  other products of heading 5605; 
 
â  glass fibres; 
 
â  metal fibres. 
 
Example: 
 
A yarn, of heading 5205, made from cotton fibres of heading 5203 and synthetic staple fibres 
of heading 5506, is a mixed yarn. Therefore, non-originating synthetic staple fibres which do 
not satisfy the origin rules may be used, provided that their total weight does not exceed 
10 % of the weight of the yarn. 
 
 
EUSFTA Protocol 1 - 56  
Example: 
 
A woollen fabric of heading 5112 that is made from woollen yarn of heading 5107 and 
synthetic yarn of staple fibres of heading 5509 is a mixed fabric. Therefore, synthetic yarn 
which does not satisfy the origin rules, or woollen yarn which does not satisfy the origin 
rules, or a combination of the two, may be used, provided that their total weight does not 
exceed 10 % of the weight of the fabric. 
 
Example: 
 
Tufted textile fabric of heading 5802 that is made from cotton yarn of heading 5205 and 
cotton fabric of heading 5210 is only a mixed product if the cotton fabric is itself a mixed 
fabric made from yarns classified in two separate headings, or if the cotton yarns used are 
themselves mixtures. 
 
Example: 
 
If the tufted textile fabric concerned had been made from cotton yarn of heading 5205 and 
synthetic fabric of heading 5407, then, obviously, the yarns used are two separate basic 
textile materials and the tufted textile fabric is, accordingly, a mixed product. 
 
6.3.  In the case of products incorporating "yarn made of polyurethane segmented with flexible 
segments of polyether, whether or not gimped", this tolerance is 20 % in respect of this yarn. 
 
 
EUSFTA Protocol 1 - 57  
6.4.  In the case of products incorporating a "strip consisting of a core of aluminium foil or of a 
core of plastic film, whether or not coated with aluminium powder, of a width not exceeding 
5 mm, sandwiched by means of a transparent or coloured adhesive between two layers of 
plastic film", the tolerance is 30 % in respect of this strip. 
 
Note 7 - Other tolerances applicable to certain textile products 
 
7.1.  Where, in the list, reference is made to this Note, textile materials (with the exception of 
linings and interlinings) which do not satisfy the rule set out in the list in column 3 for the 
made-up product concerned may be used, provided that they are classified under a heading 
other than that of the product, and provided that that their value does not exceed 8 % of the 
ex-works price of the product. 
 
7.2.  Without prejudice to Note 6.3, materials, which are not classified within Chapters 50 to 63, 
may be used freely in the manufacture of textile products, whether or not they contain 
textiles. 
 
Example: 
 
If a rule in the list provides that, for a particular textile item (such as trousers), yarn must be 
used, this does not prevent the use of metal items such as buttons, because buttons are not 
classified within Chapters 50 to 63. For the same reason, it does not prevent the use of slide-
fasteners, even though slide-fasteners normally contain textiles. 
 
 
EUSFTA Protocol 1 - 58  
7.3.  Where a percentage rule applies, the value of non-originating materials which are not 
classified within Chapters 50 to 63 must be taken into account when calculating the value of 
the non-originating materials incorporated. 
 
Note 8 - Definition of specific processes and simple operations carried out in respect of certain 
products of Chapter 27 
 
8.1.  For the purposes of headings ex 2707 and 2713, the "specific processes" are the following: 
 
(a)  vacuum-distillation; 
 
(b)  redistillation by a very thorough fractionation process; 
 
(c)  cracking; 
 
(d)  reforming; 
 
(e)  extraction by means of selective solvents; 
 
(f)  the process comprising all of the following operations: processing with concentrated 
sulphuric acid, oleum or sulphuric anhydride; neutralisation with alkaline agents; 
decolourisation and purification with naturally active earth, activated earth, activated 
charcoal or bauxite; 
 
 
EUSFTA Protocol 1 - 59  
(g)  polymerisation; 
 
(h)  alkylation; 
 
(i)  isomerisation. 
 
8.2.  For the purposes of headings 2710, 2711 and 2712, the "specific processes" are the 
following: 
 
(a)  vacuum-distillation; 
 
(b)  redistillation by a very thorough fractionation process; 
 
(c)  cracking; 
 
(d)  reforming; 
 
(e)  extraction by means of selective solvents; 
 
(f)  the process comprising all of the following operations: processing with concentrated 
sulphuric acid, oleum or sulphuric anhydride; neutralisation with alkaline agents; 
decolourisation and purification with naturally active earth, activated earth, activated 
charcoal or bauxite; 
 
 
EUSFTA Protocol 1 - 60  
(g)  polymerisation; 
 
(h)  alkylation; 
 
(i)  isomerisation; 
 
(j)  in respect of heavy oils of heading ex 2710 only, desulphurisation with hydrogen, 
resulting in a reduction of at least 85 % of the sulphur content of the products 
processed (ASTM D 1266-59 T method); 
 
(k)  in respect of products of heading 2710 only, deparaffining by a process other than 
filtering; 
 
(l)  in respect of heavy oils of heading ex 2710 only, treatment with hydrogen, at a 
pressure of more than 20 bar and a temperature of more than 250 Â°C, with the use of a 
catalyst, other than to effect desulphurisation, when the hydrogen constitutes an 
active element in a chemical reaction. The further treatment, with hydrogen, of 
lubricating oils of heading ex 2710 (e.g. hydrofinishing or decolourisation), in order, 
more especially, to improve colour or stability shall not, however, be deemed to be a 
specific process; 
 
(m)  in respect of fuel oils of heading ex 2710 only, atmospheric distillation, on condition 
that less than 30 % of these products distils, by volume, including losses, at 300 Â°C, by 
the ASTM D 86 method; 
 
 
EUSFTA Protocol 1 - 61  
(n)  in respect of heavy oils other than gas oils and fuel oils of heading ex 2710 only, 
treatment by means of a high-frequency electrical brush discharge; 
 
(o)  in respect of crude products (other than petroleum jelly, ozokerite, lignite wax or peat 
wax, paraffin wax containing by weight less than 0,75 % of oil) of heading ex 2712 only, 
de-oiling by fractional crystallisation. 
 
8.3.  For the purposes of headings ex 2707 and 2713, simple operations, such as cleaning, 
decanting, desalting, water separation, filtering, colouring, marking, obtaining a sulphur 
content as a result of mixing products with different sulphur contents, or any combination of 
these operations or like operations, do not confer origin.
