EUSFTA-IPA Annex 4 - 1 
 
ANNEX 4 
 
 
PUBLIC DEBT 
 
1. 
No claim that a restructuring of debt of a Party breaches an obligation of 
Chapter Two (Investment Protection) may be submitted, or if already submitted, be 
pursued under Section A (Resolution of Disputes between Investors and Parties) of 
Chapter Three (Dispute Settlement) if the restructuring is a negotiated restructuring at 
the time of submission or becomes a negotiated restructuring after such submission, 
except for a claim that the restructuring violates Article 2.3 (National Treatment)1. 
 
2. 
Notwithstanding Article 3.6 (Submission of Claims to the Tribunal) under 
Chapter Three (Dispute Settlement) Section A (Resolution of Disputes between 
Investors and Parties), and subject to paragraph 1 of this Annex, an investor may not 
submit a claim under Chapter Three (Dispute Settlement) Section A (Resolution of 
Disputes between Investors and Parties) that a restructuring of debt of a Party 
breaches an obligation under Chapter Two (Investment Protection) other than Article 
2.3 (National Treatment), unless 270 days have elapsed from the date of submission 
by the claimant of the written request for consultations pursuant to Article 3.3 
(Consultations) under Chapter Three (Dispute Settlement) Section A (Resolution of 
Disputes between Investors and Parties). 
 
                                                           
1 
For the purpose of this Annex, the mere fact that the relevant treatment distinguishes between 
investors or investments on the basis of legitimate public policy objectives in the context of a debt crisis or 
threat thereof does not amount to a breach of Article 2.3 (National Treatment). 
EUSFTA-IPA Annex 4 - 2 
 
3. 
For the purposes of this Annex: 
 
"negotiated restructuring" means the restructuring or rescheduling of debt of a Party 
that has been effected through (i) a modification or amendment of debt instruments, 
as provided for under their terms, including their governing law, or (ii) a debt 
exchange or other similar process in which the holders of no less than 75 % of the 
aggregate principal amount of the outstanding debt subject to restructuring have 
consented to such debt exchange or other process; 
 
"governing law" of a debt instrument means a jurisdiction's legal and regulatory 
framework applicable to that debt instrument. 
 
4. 
For greater certainty, "debt of a Party" includes, in the case of the Union, debt of a 
government of a Member State of the Union, or of a Government in a Member State 
of the Union, at the central, regional or local level.
