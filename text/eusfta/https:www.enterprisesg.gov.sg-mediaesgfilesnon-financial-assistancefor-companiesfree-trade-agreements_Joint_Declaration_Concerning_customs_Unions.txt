 EUSFTA Joint Declaration Concerning Customs Unions - 1  JOINT DECLARATION  Concerning Customs Unions  1. The Union recalls that those countries which have concluded a customs union with the Union have the obligation to align themselves with the common customs tariff and, progressively, with the preferential customs regime of the Union, taking the necessary measures and negotiating agreements on a mutually advantageous basis with the third countries concerned.  Consequently the Union had invited Singapore to enter into negotiations with those states which have established a customs union with the Union and whose products do not benefit from the tariff concessions under this Agreement, to conclude bilateral agreements establishing a free trade area in accordance with Article XXIV of GATT.  2. Singapore has informed the Union that Singapore will enter into negotiations with countries relevant in this respect as at the date of signature of this Agreement to conclude bilateral agreements establishing a free trade area in accordance with Article XXIV of GATT.   _________________
