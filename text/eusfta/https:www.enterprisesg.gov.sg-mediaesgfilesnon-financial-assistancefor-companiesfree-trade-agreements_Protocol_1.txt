SECTION 2  DEFINITION OF THE CONCEPT OF "ORIGINATING PRODUCTS"   ARTICLE 2  General Requirements  For the purposes of this Agreement, the following products shall be considered as originating in a Party:  (a) products wholly obtained in a Party within the meaning of Article 4; and    EUSFTA Protocol 1 - 8 (b) products obtained in a Party incorporating materials which have not been wholly obtained there, provided that such materials have undergone sufficient working or processing in the Party concerned within the meaning of Article 5.   ARTICLE 3  Cumulation of Origin  1. Notwithstanding Article 2 (General Requirements), products shall be considered as originating in a Party if such products are obtained there by incorporating materials originating in the other Party, provided that the working or processing carried out goes beyond the operations referred to in Article 6 (Insufficient Working or Processing). It shall not be necessary that the materials of the other Party have undergone sufficient working or processing.  2. Materials originating in an ASEAN country which is applying with the Union a preferential agreement in accordance with Article XXIV of the GATT 1994, shall be considered as materials originating in a Party when incorporated in a product obtained in that Party, provided that they have undergone working or processing in that Party which goes beyond the operations referred to in Article 6 (Insufficient Working or Processing).  3. For the purposes of paragraph 2, the origin of the materials shall be determined according to the rules of origin applicable in the framework of the Union's preferential agreements with those countries.    EUSFTA Protocol 1 - 9 4. For the purposes of paragraph 2, the originating status of materials exported from one of the ASEAN countries to a Party to be used in further working or processing shall be established by a proof of origin under which these materials could be exported directly to the Union.  5. The cumulation provided for in paragraphs 2 to 7 may only be applied provided that:  (a) the ASEAN countries involved in the acquisition of the originating status have undertaken to:  (i) comply or ensure compliance with this Protocol; and  (ii) provide the administrative cooperation necessary to ensure the correct implementation of this Protocol both with regard to the Union and among themselves;  (b) the undertakings referred to in subparagraph (a) have been notified to the Union.  6. Origin declarations issued by application of paragraph 4 shall bear one of the following entries:  (a) "Application of Article 3(2) of Protocol 1 of the EU/Singapore FTA"; or  (b) "Application du paragraphe 2 de l'article 3 du protocole nÂ° 1 de l'ALE UE/Singapour".    EUSFTA Protocol 1 - 10 7. The materials listed in Annex C to this Protocol shall be excluded from the cumulation provided for in paragraphs 2 to 6 where at the time of importation of the product:  (a) the tariff preference applicable to the materials in a Party is not the same for all the countries involved in the cumulation; and  (b) the materials concerned would benefit, through cumulation, from a tariff treatment more favourable than the one they would benefit from if directly exported to a Party.  8. At the request of a Party, the Parties, by decision in the Committee on Customs established pursuant to Article 16.2 (Specialised Committees), may modify Annex C to this Protocol. Any request for such a modification shall be communicated to the other Party at least two months before the meeting of that Committee.  9. Materials originating in an ASEAN country shall be considered as materials originating in a Party when further processed or incorporated into one of the products listed in Annex D to this Protocol obtained there, provided that they have undergone working or processing in that Party which goes beyond the operations referred to in Article 6 (Insufficient Working or Processing).  10. For the purposes of paragraph 9, the origin of the materials shall be determined according to the preferential rules of origin applicable to General System of Preferences (hereinafter referred to as "GSP") beneficiary countries which are laid down in Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) 2015/24461.                                                   1 Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) 2015/2446 of 28 July 2015 supplementing Regulation (EU) No 952/2013 of the European Parliament and of the Council as regards detailed rules concerning certain provisions of the Union Customs Code (OJ EU L 343, 29.12.2015, p. 1).   EUSFTA Protocol 1 - 11 11. For the purposes of paragraph 9, the originating status of materials exported from one of the ASEAN countries to a Party to be used in further working or processing shall be established by a proof of origin in accordance with the preferential rules applicable to GSP beneficiary countries as laid down in Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) 2015/2446.  12. The cumulation provided for in paragraphs 9 to 13 may only be applied on the condition that:  (a) the ASEAN countries involved in the acquisition of the originating status have undertaken to:  (i) comply or ensure compliance with this Protocol; and  (ii) provide the administrative cooperation necessary to ensure the correct implementation of this Protocol both with regard to the Union and between themselves;  (b) the undertakings referred to in subparagraph (a) have been notified to the Union.  13. Origin declarations issued by application of paragraph 9 shall bear one of the following entries:  (a) "Application of Article 3(9) of Protocol 1 of the EU/Singapore FTA"; or  (b) "Application du paragraphe 9 de l'article 3 du protocole nÂ° 1 de l'ALE UE/Singapour".    EUSFTA Protocol 1 - 12 14. At the request of a Party, the Parties, by decision in the Committee on Customs established pursuant to Article 16.2 (Specialised Committees), may modify Annex D to this Protocol. Any request for such a modification shall be communicated to the other Party at least two months before the meeting of the Committee.  15. The cumulation provided for in paragraph 9 to 13 shall cease to apply when conditions of paragraphs 2 to 7 are met.   ARTICLE 4  Wholly Obtained Products  1. The following shall be considered as wholly obtained in a Party:  (a) mineral products extracted from their soil or from their seabed;  (b) plants and vegetable products grown or harvested there;  (c) live animals born and raised there;  (d) products from live animals raised there;  (e) products from slaughtered animals born and raised there;    EUSFTA Protocol 1 - 13 (f) products obtained by hunting or fishing conducted there;  (g) products of aquaculture from fish, crustaceans and molluscs that are born and raised there;  (h) products of sea fishing and other products taken from the sea outside the territorial seas of a Party by their vessels;  (i) products made aboard their factory ships exclusively from products referred to in subparagraph (h);  (j) used articles collected there that are fit only for the recovery of raw materials;  (k) waste and scrap resulting from manufacturing operations conducted there;  (l) products extracted from marine soil or subsoil outside the territorial seas of a Party, provided that the Party has sole rights to work that soil or subsoil; and  (m) goods produced there exclusively from products specified in subparagraphs (a) to (l).  2. The terms "their vessels" and "their factory ships" in subparagraphs 1(h) and 1(i) shall apply only to vessels and factory ships:  (a) which are registered in a Member State of the Union or in Singapore;    EUSFTA Protocol 1 - 14 (b) which sail under the flag of a Member State of the Union or of Singapore; and  (c) which meet one of the following conditions:  (i) they are at least fifty percent owned by nationals of a Member State of the Union or of Singapore;  or  (ii) they are owned by companies:  (1) which have their head office and their main place of business in a Member State of the Union or in Singapore, and  (2) which are at least fifty percent owned by a Member State of the Union or by Singapore, by public entities or nationals of a Party.   ARTICLE 5  Sufficiently Worked or Processed Products  1. For the purposes of subparagraph (b) of Article 2 (General Requirements), products which are not wholly obtained are considered to be sufficiently worked or processed when the conditions set out in the list in Annex B or B(a) to this Protocol are fulfilled.    EUSFTA Protocol 1 - 15 2. The conditions referred to above indicate, for all products covered by this Agreement, the working or processing which must be carried out on non-originating materials used in manufacturing, and apply only in relation to such materials. It follows that if a product which has acquired originating status by fulfilling the conditions set out in the list in Annex B or B(a) to this Protocol is used in the manufacture of another product, the conditions applicable to the product in which it is incorporated do not apply to the product that acquired originating status, and no account shall be taken of the non-originating materials which may have been used in its manufacture.  3. By way of derogation from paragraph 1 and subject to paragraphs 4 and 5, non-originating materials which, according to the conditions set out in the list in Annex B or B(a) to this Protocol, are not to be used in the manufacture of a given product may nevertheless be used, provided that their total value or net weight assessed for the product does not exceed:  (a) ten percent of the weight of the product for products falling within Chapters 2 and 4 to 24 of the Harmonized System, other than processed fishery products of Chapter 16;  (b) ten percent of the ex-works price of the product for other products, except for products falling within Chapters 50 to 63 of the Harmonized System, for which the tolerances mentioned in Notes 6 and 7 of Annex A to this Protocol, shall apply.  4. Paragraph 3 shall not be construed to allow any of the percentages for the maximum content of non-originating materials as specified in the list in Annex B to this Protocol to be exceeded.    EUSFTA Protocol 1 - 16 5. Paragraphs 3 and 4 do not apply to products wholly obtained in a Party within the meaning of Article 4 (Wholly Obtained Products). However, without prejudice to Article 6 (Insufficient Working or Processing) and paragraph 2 of Article 7 (Unit of Qualification) the tolerance provided for in those paragraphs shall nevertheless apply to the sum of all the materials which are used in the manufacture of a product and for which the rule for that product laid down in the list in Annex B to this Protocol requires that such materials be wholly obtained.   ARTICLE 6  Insufficient Working or Processing  1. Without prejudice to paragraph 2, the following operations shall be considered as insufficient working or processing to confer the status of originating products, whether or not the requirements of Article 5 (Sufficiently Worked or Processed Products) are satisfied:  (a) preserving operations to ensure that the products remain in good condition during transport and storage;  (b) the breaking-up and assembly of packages;  (c) the washing, cleaning; removal of dust, oxide, oil, paint or other coverings;  (d) the ironing or pressing of textiles and textile articles;    EUSFTA Protocol 1 - 17 (e) simple painting and polishing operations;  (f) the husking and partial or total milling of rice; the polishing and glazing of cereals and rice;  (g) operations to colour or flavour sugar or form sugar lumps; the partial or total milling of crystal sugar;  (h) the peeling, stoning and shelling of fruits, nuts and vegetables;  (i) sharpening, simple grinding or simple cutting;  (j) sifting, screening, sorting, classifying, grading, matching (including the making-up of sets of articles);  (k) simple placing in bottles, cans, flasks, bags, cases, boxes, fixing on cards or boards and all other simple packaging operations;  (l) the affixing or printing of marks, labels, logos and other like distinguishing signs on products or their packaging;  (m) the simple mixing of products, whether or not of different kinds; mixing of sugar with any material;  (n) the simple addition of water to or the dilution, dehydration or denaturation of products;    EUSFTA Protocol 1 - 18 (o) the simple assembly of parts of articles to constitute a complete article or the disassembly of products into parts;  (p) a combination of two or more of the operations specified in subparagraphs (a) to (o); or  (q) the slaughter of animals.  2. For the purpose of paragraph 1, operations shall be considered simple when no special skills or machines, apparatus or tools that were especially produced or installed for those operations are required for their performance.  3. All operations on a given product carried out either in the Union or in Singapore shall be considered together when determining whether the working or processing undergone by that product is to be regarded as insufficient within the meaning of paragraph 1.   ARTICLE 7  Unit of Qualification  1. The unit of qualification for the application of the provisions of this Protocol shall be the product which is considered as the basic unit when determining classification using the nomenclature of the Harmonized System.    EUSFTA Protocol 1 - 19 2. When a consignment consists of a number of identical products classified under the same heading of the Harmonized System, each individual item shall be taken into account when applying the provisions of this Protocol.  Where, under General Interpretative Rule 5 of the Harmonized System, packaging is included with the product for classification purposes, the packaging shall be included for the purposes of determining origin.   ARTICLE 8  Accessories, Spare Parts and Tools  Accessories, spare parts and tools dispatched with a piece of equipment, machine, apparatus or vehicle, which are part of the normal equipment and included in the price thereof or which are not separately invoiced, shall be regarded as one with the piece of equipment, machine, apparatus or vehicle in question.     EUSFTA Protocol 1 - 20 ARTICLE 9  Sets  Sets, as defined in General Interpretative Rule 3 of the Harmonized System, shall be regarded as originating when all component products are originating products. When a set is composed of originating and non-originating products, the set as a whole shall be regarded as originating, provided that the value of the non-originating products does not exceed fifteen percent of the ex-works price of the set.   ARTICLE 10  Neutral Elements  In order to determine whether a product originates in a Party, it shall not be necessary to determine the origin of the following elements which might be used in its manufacture:  (a) energy and fuel;  (b) plant and equipment, including goods to be used for their maintenance;    EUSFTA Protocol 1 - 21 (c) machines and tools and dies and moulds; spare parts and materials used in the maintenance of equipment and buildings; lubricants, greases, compounding materials and other materials used in production or used to operate equipment and buildings; gloves, glasses, footwear, clothing, safety equipment and supplies; equipment, devices and supplies used for testing or inspecting the good; catalysts and solvents; and  (d) other goods which do not enter, and which are not intended to enter, into the final composition of the product.   ARTICLE 11  Accounting Segregation  1. If originating and non-originating fungible materials are used in the working or processing of a product, the competent governmental authorities, at the written request of economic operators, may authorise the management of materials using the accounting segregation method without keeping the materials in separate stocks.  2. The competent governmental authorities may make the granting of the authorisation referred to in paragraph 1 subject to any conditions they deem appropriate.    EUSFTA Protocol 1 - 22 3. The authorisation shall be granted only if it can be ensured by use of the accounting segregation method that, at any given time, the number of products obtained which could be considered as originating in the Union or in Singapore is the same as the number that would have been obtained by using a method of physical segregation of the stocks.  4. If authorised, the accounting segregation method, for example, averaging, last-in, first-out, or first-in, first-out, shall be applied and the method used shall be recorded on the basis of the general accounting principles applicable in the Union or in Singapore, depending on where the product is manufactured.  5. A manufacturer using the accounting segregation method shall make out or apply for origin declarations for the quantity of products which may be considered as originating in the exporting Party. At the request of the customs authorities or competent governmental authorities of the exporting Party, the beneficiary shall provide a statement of how the quantities have been managed.  6. The competent governmental authorities shall monitor the use made of the authorisations referred to in paragraph 3 and may withdraw them if a manufacturer makes improper use of the authorisation or fails to fulfil any of the other conditions laid down in this Protocol.     EUSFTA Protocol 1 - 23 SECTION 3  TERRITORIAL REQUIREMENTS   ARTICLE 12  Principle of Territoriality  1. The conditions set out in Section 2 relating to the acquisition of originating status must be fulfilled without interruption in a Party.  2. If originating goods exported from a Party to a non-Party return, they must be considered as non-originating goods, unless it can be demonstrated to the satisfaction of the customs authorities that:  (a) the returning goods are the same as those exported; and  (b) they have not undergone any operation beyond that necessary to preserve them in good condition while in that non-Party or while being exported.     EUSFTA Protocol 1 - 24 ARTICLE 13  Non Alteration  1. The products declared for importation in a Party shall be the same products as exported from the other Party in which they are considered to originate. They shall not have been altered, transformed in any way or subjected to operations other than operations to preserve them in good condition or other than adding or affixing marks, labels, seals or any other documentation to ensure compliance with specific domestic requirements of the importing Party, prior to being declared for import.  2. The storage of products or consignments may take place, provided they remain under customs supervision in the country(ies) of transit.  3. Without prejudice to Section 5, the splitting of consignments may take place where carried out by the exporter or under his responsibility provided they remain under customs supervision in the country(ies) of transit.  4. Compliance with paragraphs 1 to 3 shall be considered as satisfied unless the customs authorities have reason to believe the contrary; in such cases, the customs authorities may request the declarant to provide evidence of compliance, which may be given by any means, including contractual transport documents such as bills of lading or factual or concrete evidence based on marking or numbering of packages or any evidence related to the goods themselves.     EUSFTA Protocol 1 - 25 ARTICLE 14  Exhibitions  1. Originating products, sent for exhibition in a country other than a Party and sold after the exhibition for importation in a Party shall benefit on importation from the provisions of this Agreement provided it is shown to the satisfaction of the customs authorities that:  (a) an exporter has consigned these products from a Party to the country in which the exhibition is held and has exhibited them there;  (b) the products have been sold or otherwise disposed of by that exporter to a person in a Party;  (c) the products have been consigned during the exhibition or immediately thereafter in the state in which they were sent for exhibition; and  (d) the products have not been used for any purpose other than demonstration at the exhibition since they were consigned for exhibition.  2. An origin declaration shall be issued or made out in accordance with the provisions of Section 5 and submitted to the customs authorities of the importing Party in the normal manner. The name and address of the exhibition must be indicated thereon. Where necessary, additional documentary evidence of the conditions under which they have been exhibited may be required.    EUSFTA Protocol 1 - 26 3. Paragraph 1 shall apply to any trade, industrial, agricultural or crafts exhibition, fair or similar public show or display which is not organised for private purposes in shops or business premises with a view to the sale of foreign products, during which the products remain under customs control.   SECTION 4  DRAWBACK OR EXEMPTION   ARTICLE 15  Prohibition of Drawback of, or Exemption from, Customs Duties  1. Non-originating materials used in the manufacture of products originating in the Union or in Singapore, for which an origin declaration has been issued or made out in accordance with the provisions of Section 5, shall not be subject in the Union or in Singapore to drawback of, or exemption from, customs duties of whatever kind.  2. The prohibition in paragraph 1 shall apply to any arrangement for refund, remission or non-payment, whether partial or complete, of customs duties or charges having an equivalent effect, applicable in the Union or in Singapore to materials used in the manufacture, where such refund, remission or non-payment applies, whether expressly or in effect, where the products obtained from such materials are exported, but not where they are retained in a Party for home use.    EUSFTA Protocol 1 - 27 3. The exporter of products covered by an origin declaration shall be prepared to submit at any time, upon request from the customs authorities, all appropriate documents to prove that no drawback has been obtained in respect of the non-originating materials used in the manufacture of the products concerned and that all customs duties or charges having equivalent effect applicable to such materials have actually been paid.  4. The provisions of paragraphs 1 to 3 shall also apply in respect of packaging within the meaning of paragraph 2 of Article 7 (Unit of Qualification), accessories, spare parts and tools within the meaning of Article 8 (Accessories, Spare Parts and Tools), and products in a set within the meaning of Article 9 (Sets), when such items are non-originating.  5. The provisions of paragraphs 1 to 4 shall apply only in respect of materials which are subject to this Protocol.     EUSFTA Protocol 1 - 28 SECTION 5  ORIGIN DECLARATION   ARTICLE 16  General Requirements  1. Products originating in the Union, on importation into Singapore, and products originating in Singapore, on importation into the Union, shall benefit from preferential tariff treatment of this Agreement upon submission of a declaration, (hereinafter referred to as "origin declaration"). The origin declaration is to be provided on an invoice or any other commercial document that describes the originating product in sufficient detail to enable its identification.  2. Originating products within the meaning of this Protocol, in the cases specified in Article 22 (Exemptions from Origin Declaration), shall benefit from preferential tariff treatment of this Agreement without it being necessary to submit any of the documents referred to in paragraph 1.     EUSFTA Protocol 1 - 29 ARTICLE 17  Conditions for Making Out an Origin Declaration  1. An origin declaration as referred to in Article 16 (General Requirements) may be made out:  (a) in the Union:  (i) by an exporter within the meaning of Article 18 (Approved Exporter); or  (ii) by an exporter for any consignment consisting of one or more packages containing originating products whose total value does not exceed 6 000 euro.

EUSFTA Protocol 1 - 30 3. The exporter making out an origin declaration shall be prepared at all times to submit, at the request of the customs authorities of the exporting Party, all appropriate documents as referred to under Article 23 (Supporting Documents) proving the originating status of the products concerned as well as the fulfilment of the other requirements of this Protocol.  4. An origin declaration shall be made out by the exporter by typing, stamping or printing on the invoice, the delivery note or another commercial document, the declaration, the text of which appears in Annex E to this Protocol, in accordance with the domestic law of the exporting Party. If the declaration is hand-written, it shall be written in ink in capital characters. In the case of exports from Singapore, the origin declaration shall be set out using the English version, and in the case of exports from Union, the origin declaration may be set out in one of the linguistic versions, in Annex E to this Protocol.  5. Origin declarations shall bear the original signature of the exporter in manuscript. An approved exporter as referred to in Article 18 (Approved Exporter) shall not be required to sign such declarations provided that he gives the customs authorities of the exporting Party a written undertaking that he accepts full responsibility for any origin declaration which identifies him as if it had been signed in manuscript by him.  6. By derogation from paragraph 1, an origin declaration may exceptionally be made out after exportation ("retrospective statement") on condition that it is presented in the importing Party no later than two years, in the case of the Union, and one year, in the case of Singapore, after the entry of the goods into the territory.     EUSFTA Protocol 1 - 31 ARTICLE 18  Approved Exporter  1. The customs authorities of the Member States of the Union may authorise any exporter who exports products under this Agreement to make out origin declarations irrespective of the value of the products concerned (hereinafter referred to as "approved exporter"). An exporter seeking such authorisation must offer to the satisfaction of the customs authorities all guarantees necessary to verify the originating status of the products as well as the fulfilment of the other requirements of this Protocol.  2. The customs authorities of the Member States of the Union may grant the status of approved exporter subject to any conditions which they consider appropriate.  3. The customs authorities of the Member States of the Union shall grant to the approved exporter a customs authorisation number which shall appear on the origin declaration.  4. The customs authorities of the Member States of the Union shall monitor the use of the authorisation by the approved exporter.  5. The customs authorities of the Member States of the Union may withdraw the authorisation at any time. They shall do so where the approved exporter no longer offers the guarantees referred to in paragraph 1, no longer fulfils the conditions referred to in paragraph 2 or otherwise makes an incorrect use of the authorisation.     EUSFTA Protocol 1 - 32 ARTICLE 19  Validity of Origin Declaration  1. An origin declaration shall be valid for twelve months from the date of issue in the exporting Party. Preferential tariff treatment shall be claimed within such period to the customs authorities of the importing Party.  2. Origin declarations which are submitted to the customs authorities of the importing Party after the final date for presentation specified in paragraph 1 may be accepted for the purposes of applying preferential treatment, where the failure to submit these documents by the final date set is due to exceptional circumstances.  3. In cases of belated presentation other than those of paragraph 2, the customs authorities of the importing Party may accept the origin declarations where the products have been submitted before such final date.   ARTICLE 20  Submission of Origin Declaration  For the purposes of claiming preferential tariff treatment, origin declarations shall be submitted to the customs authorities of the importing Party in accordance with the procedures applicable in that Party. Such authorities may require a translation of an origin declaration.

ARTICLE 22  Exemptions from Origin Declaration  1. Products which are sent as small packages from private persons to private persons, or which form part of travellers' personal luggage, shall be admitted as originating products without requiring the submission of an origin declaration, provided that such products are not imported by way of trade and have been declared as meeting the requirements of this Protocol, and provided that there is no doubt as to the veracity of such a declaration. In the case of products sent by post, this declaration can be made on the customs declaration CN22/CN23 or on a sheet of paper annexed to that document.    EUSFTA Protocol 1 - 34 2. Imports which are occasional and consist solely of products for the personal use of the recipients or of travellers or their families shall not be considered as imports by way of trade if it is evident from the nature and quantity of the products that no commercial purpose is intended.  3. The total value of these products shall not exceed 500 euro in the case of small packages or 1200 euro in the case of products forming part of travellers' personal luggage.

The exporter making out an origin declaration shall keep a copy of this origin declaration, as well as the documents referred to in paragraph 3 of Article 17 (Conditions for Making Out an Origin Declaration), for at least three years.  2. The customs authorities of the importing Party shall keep the origin declarations submitted to them for at least three years.  3. Each Party shall permit, in accordance with that Party's laws and regulations, exporters in its territory to maintain documentation or records in any medium, provided that the documentation or records can be retrieved and printed.   ARTICLE 25  Discrepancies and Formal Errors  1. The discovery of slight discrepancies between the statements made in the origin declaration and those made in the documents submitted to the customs office for the purposes of carrying out the formalities for importing the products shall not ipso facto render the origin declaration null and void if it is duly established that that document corresponds to the products submitted.    EUSFTA Protocol 1 - 36 2. Obvious formal errors such as typing errors on a origin declaration should not cause the document to be rejected if those errors are not such as to create doubts concerning the correctness of the statements made in the document.   ARTICLE 26  Amounts Expressed in Euro  1. For the application of the provisions of subparagraph 1(a)(ii) of Article 17 (Conditions for Making Out an Origin Declaration) and paragraph 3 of Article 22 (Exemptions from Origin Declaration) in cases where products are invoiced in a currency other than euro, amounts in the national currencies of the Member States of the Union equivalent to the amounts expressed in euro shall be fixed annually by each of the countries concerned.  2. A consignment shall benefit from the provisions of subparagraph 1(a)(ii) of Article 17 (Conditions for Making Out an Origin Declaration) and paragraph 3 of Article 22 (Exemptions from Origin Declaration) by reference to the currency in which the invoice is drawn up, according to the amount fixed by the Party concerned.  3. The amounts to be used in any given national currency shall be the equivalent in that currency of the amounts expressed in euro as at the first working day of October. The amounts shall be communicated to the European Commission by 15 October and shall apply from 1 January the following year. The European Commission shall notify all countries concerned of the relevant amounts.    EUSFTA Protocol 1 - 37 4. A Member State of the Union may round up or down the amount resulting from the conversion into its national currency of an amount expressed in euro. The rounded amount may not differ from the amount resulting from the conversion by more than five percent. A Member State of the Union may retain unchanged its national currency equivalent of an amount expressed in euro if, at the time of the annual adjustment provided for in paragraph 3, the conversion of that amount, prior to any rounding-off, results in an increase of less than fifteen percent in the national currency equivalent. The national currency equivalent may be retained unchanged if the conversion would result in a decrease in that equivalent value.  5. The amounts expressed in euro shall be reviewed by the Parties in the Committee on Customs established pursuant to Article 16.2 (Specialised Committees) at the request of the Union or of Singapore. When carrying out this review, the Parties shall consider the desirability of preserving the effects of the limits concerned in real terms. For these purposes, the Parties may, by decision in the Committee on Customs, modify the amounts expressed in euro.     EUSFTA Protocol 1 - 38 SECTION 6  ARRANGEMENTS FOR ADMINISTRATIVE COOPERATION   ARTICLE 27  Cooperation between Competent Authorities  1. The customs authorities of the Parties shall provide each other, through the European Commission, with the addresses of the customs authorities responsible for verifying the origin declarations.  2. In order to ensure the proper application of this Protocol, the Parties shall assist each other, through their competent authorities, in checking the authenticity of origin declarations and the correctness of the information given in such documents.   ARTICLE 28  Verification of Origin Declarations  1. Subsequent verifications of origin declarations shall be carried out at random or whenever the customs authorities of the importing Party have reasonable doubts as to the authenticity of such documents, the originating status of the products concerned or the fulfilment of the other requirements of this Protocol.    EUSFTA Protocol 1 - 39 2. For the purposes of implementing the provisions of paragraph 1, if it has been submitted, the customs authorities of the importing Party shall return the origin declaration, or a copy of that document, to the customs authorities of the exporting Party giving, where appropriate, the reasons for the enquiry. Any document and information obtained suggesting that the information given on the origin declarations is incorrect shall be forwarded in support of the request for verification.  3. The verification shall be carried out by the customs authorities of the exporting Party. For this purpose, they shall have the right to request any evidence and to carry out any inspection of the exporter's accounts or any other check considered appropriate.  4. If the customs authorities of the importing Party decide to suspend the granting of preferential treatment to the products concerned while awaiting the results of the verification, the release of the products shall be offered to the importer, subject to any precautionary measures judged necessary. Any suspension of preferential treatment shall be reinstated as soon as possible after the originating status of the products concerned or the fulfilment of the other requirements of this Protocol has been ascertained by the customs authorities of the importing Party.  5. The customs authorities requesting the verification shall be informed of the results of this verification as soon as possible. These results must indicate clearly whether the documents are authentic and whether the products concerned can be considered as products originating in the Parties and fulfil the other requirements of this Protocol.    EUSFTA Protocol 1 - 40 6. If, in cases of reasonable doubt, there is no reply within ten months of the date of the verification request or the reply does not contain sufficient information to allow the requesting customs authorities to determine the authenticity of the document in question or the real origin of the products, the requesting customs authorities, except in exceptional circumstances, shall refuse entitlement to the preferences.   ARTICLE 29  Administrative Enquiries  1. Where the results of the verification procedure or any other available substantive information appear to indicate that the provisions of this Protocol are being contravened, the exporting Party, on its own initiative or at the request of the other Party, shall carry out appropriate enquiries or arrange for such enquiries to be carried out with due urgency to identify and prevent such contraventions. The results of such enquiries shall be communicated to the Party requesting verification.  2. The Party requesting verification may be present at the enquiries, subject to conditions that may be laid down by the competent authority in the exporting Party.    EUSFTA Protocol 1 - 41 3. Where a Party has made a finding, on the basis of objective information, of a repeated failure2 to provide administrative cooperation under this Section, or of systematic and intentional fraud from the other Party, the Party concerned may temporarily suspend the relevant preferential treatment of the product or products concerned in accordance with paragraph 4.  4. The application of a temporary suspension shall be subject to the following conditions:  (a) the Party which has made a finding in accordance with paragraph 3 shall without undue delay notify the Trade Committee established pursuant to Article 16.1 (Trade Committee) of its finding together with the objective information and its recommended course of action to be taken. Upon receipt of such notification, the Trade Committee shall deliberate on the appropriate course of action on the basis of all relevant information and objective findings, with a view to reaching a solution acceptable to both Parties. During the period of consultations referred to above, the product(s) concerned shall enjoy the preferential treatment;  (b) where the Parties have entered into consultations with the Trade Committee and have failed to agree on an acceptable solution within three months following the notification, the Party concerned may temporarily suspend the relevant preferential treatment of the product(s) concerned in so far as is strictly necessary to address the Party's concerns. Such temporary suspension shall be notified to the Trade Committee without undue delay;                                                   2 For the purposes of paragraph 3 of Article 29 (Administrative Enquiries), a repeated failure to provide administrative cooperation shall mean, inter alia, a repeated failure to respect the obligations to verify the originating status of the product(s) concerned, or a repeated refusal or undue delay in carrying out and/or communicating the results of enquiries and/or subsequent verification of the proof of origin, over a continuous period of ten months.   EUSFTA Protocol 1 - 42 (c) temporary suspensions under this Article shall be commensurate with the impact on the financial interests of the Party concerned arising from the situation giving rise to the finding of the Party referred to paragraph 3. They shall not exceed a period of six months, which may be renewed, if at the date of expiry nothing substantive has changed with respect to the condition that gave rise to the initial suspension; and  (d) temporary suspensions, and any renewal thereof, shall be notified immediately after their adoption to the Trade Committee. They shall be subject to periodic consultations within the Trade Committee, in particular with a view to their termination as soon as the conditions for their application no longer apply.   ARTICLE 30  Settlement of Disputes  1. Where disputes arise in relation to the verification procedures of Article 28 (Verification of Origin Declarations) which cannot be settled between the competent authorities requesting a verification and the competent authorities responsible for carrying out this verification, or where they raise a question as to the interpretation of this Protocol, they shall be submitted to the Committee on Customs established pursuant to Article 16.2 (Specialised Committees).  2. All disputes between the importer and the competent authorities of the importing Party shall be settled under the legislation of that Party.     EUSFTA Protocol 1 - 43 ARTICLE 31  Penalties  The Parties shall provide for procedures for penalties to be imposed on any person who draws up, or causes to be drawn up, a document which contains incorrect information for the purpose of obtaining a preferential treatment for products.   SECTION 7  CEUTA AND MELILLA   ARTICLE 32  Application of this Protocol  1. The term "Union" does not cover Ceuta and Melilla.  2. Products originating in Singapore, when imported into Ceuta or Melilla, shall enjoy in all respects the same customs regime as that which is applied to products originating in the customs territory of the Union under Protocol 2 of the Act concerning the conditions of accession of the Kingdom of Spain and the Portuguese Republic and the adjustments to the Treaties.3 Singapore shall grant to imports of products covered by the Agreement and originating in Ceuta and Melilla the same customs regime as that which is granted to products imported from and originating in the Union.                                                   3 OJ EU L 302, 15.11.1985, p. 23.   EUSFTA Protocol 1 - 44 3. For the purpose of the application of paragraph 2 concerning products originating in Ceuta and Melilla, this Protocol shall apply mutatis mutandis subject to the special conditions set out in Article 33 (Special Conditions).   ARTICLE 33  Special Conditions  1. Provided that they have been transported directly in accordance with the provisions of Article 13 (Non Alteration), the following shall be considered as:  (a) products originating in Ceuta and Melilla:  (i) products wholly obtained in Ceuta and Melilla;  (ii) products obtained in Ceuta and Melilla in the manufacture of which products other than those referred to in (a) are used, provided that:  (aa) such products have undergone sufficient working or processing within the meaning of Article 5 (Sufficiently Worked or Processed Products); or  (bb) those products are originating in a Party, provided that they have been submitted to working or processing which goes beyond the operations referred to in Article 6 (Insufficient Working or Processing).    EUSFTA Protocol 1 - 45 (b) products originating in Singapore:  (i) products wholly obtained in Singapore;  (ii) products obtained in Singapore in the manufacture of which products other than those referred to in (a) are used, provided that:  (aa) such products have undergone sufficient working or processing within the meaning of Article 5 (Sufficiently Worked or Processed Products); or  (bb) such products originate in Ceuta and Melilla or in the Union, and provided that they have undergone working or processing which goes beyond the operations referred to in Article 6 (Insufficient Working or Processing).  2. Ceuta and Melilla shall be considered as a single territory.  3. The exporter or his authorised representative shall enter "Singapore" and "Ceuta and Melilla" on origin declarations for products originating in these territories respectively.  4. The Spanish customs authorities shall be responsible for the application of this Protocol in Ceuta and Melilla.     EUSFTA Protocol 1 - 46 SECTION 8  FINAL PROVISIONS   ARTICLE 34  Amendments to this Protocol  The Parties, by decision in the Committee on Customs established pursuant to Article 16.2 (Specialised Committees), may amend the provisions of this Protocol. Following the conclusion of a free trade agreement between the Union and one or several ASEAN countries, the Parties, by decision in the Committee on Customs established pursuant to Article 16.2 (Specialised Committees), may amend or adapt this Protocol and in particular Annex C referred to in paragraph 7 of Article 3 (Cumulation of Origin) to ensure coherence between the rules of origin applicable within the context of the preferential exchanges between ASEAN countries and the Union.     EUSFTA Protocol 1 - 47 ARTICLE 35  Transitional Provisions for Goods in Transit or Storage  This Agreement may be applied to goods which comply with the provisions of this Protocol, and which on the date of entry into force of this Agreement are either in transit, in the Parties in temporary storage, in customs warehouses or in free zones, provided that an origin declaration that was made out retrospectively is submitted to the customs authorities of the importing Party within twelve months of that date, and, if requested, such declaration is submitted together with the documents showing that the goods have been transported directly in accordance with Article 13 (Non Alteration).   EUSFTA Protocol 1 - 48 ANNEX A   INTRODUCTORY NOTES TO THE LIST IN ANNEX B  Note 1 â General introduction  The list sets out the conditions required for all products to be considered as sufficiently worked or processed within the meaning of Article 5 (Sufficiently Worked or Processed Products) of the Protocol. There are four different types of rule, which vary according to the product:  (a) through working or processing, a maximum content of non-originating materials is not exceeded;  (b) through working or processing, the applicable 4-digit Harmonized System heading or 6-digit Harmonized System sub-heading for the manufactured products becomes different from the respective 4-digit Harmonized System heading or 6-digit sub-heading for the materials used;  (c) a specific working and processing operation is carried out; and  (d) working or processing is carried out on certain wholly-obtained materials.    EUSFTA Protocol 1 - 49 Note 2 â The structure of the list  2.1. The first two columns in the list describe the product obtained. The first column gives the heading number or chapter number used in the Harmonized System and the second column gives the description of goods used in that system for that heading or chapter. For each entry in the first two columns, a rule is specified in column 3. Where, in some cases, the entry in the first column is preceded by an "ex", this signifies that the rules in column 3 apply only to the part of that heading as described in column 2.  2.2. Where several heading numbers are grouped together in column 1, or a chapter number is given and the description of products in column 2 is therefore given in general terms, the adjacent rules in column 3 apply to all products which, under the Harmonized System, are classified in headings of the chapter or in any of the headings grouped together in column 1.  2.3. Where there are different rules in the list applying to different products within a heading, each indent contains the description of that part of the heading covered by the adjacent rules in column 3.  2.4. Where two alternative rules are set out in column 3, separated by "or", it is at the choice of the exporter which one to use.    EUSFTA Protocol 1 - 50 Note 3 â Examples of how to apply the rules  3.1. Article 5 (Sufficiently Worked or Processed Products) of the Protocol, concerning products having acquired originating status which are used in the manufacture of other products, shall apply, regardless of whether this status has been acquired inside the factory where these products are used or in another factory in a Party.  3.2. Pursuant to Article 6 (Insufficient Working or Processing) of the Protocol, the working or processing carried out must go beyond the list of operations mentioned in that Article. If it does not, the goods shall not qualify for the granting of the benefit of preferential tariff treatment, even if the conditions set out in the list below are met.  Subject to the provision referred to in the first sub-paragraph, the rules in the list represent the minimum amount of working or processing required, and the carrying-out of more working or processing also confers originating status; conversely, the carrying-out of less working or processing cannot confer originating status.  Thus, if a rule provides that non-originating material may be used at a certain stage of manufacture, the use of such material at an earlier stage of manufacture is allowed, and the use of such material at a later stage is not.  If a rule provides that non-originating material, at a certain level of manufacture, may not be used, the use of materials at an earlier stage of manufacture is allowed, and the use of materials at a later stage is not.    EUSFTA Protocol 1 - 51 Example: when the list-rule for Chapter 19 requires that "non-originating materials of headings 1101 to 1108 cannot exceed 20 per cent weight", the use (i.e. importation) of cereals of Chapter 10 (materials at an earlier stage of manufacture) is not limited.  3.3. Without prejudice to Note 3.2, where a rule uses the expression "Manufacture from materials of any heading", then materials of any heading(s) (even materials of the same description and heading as the product) may be used, subject, however, to any specific limitations which may also be contained in the rule.  The expression "Manufacture from materials of any heading, including other materials of heading [...]" or "Manufacture from materials of any heading, including other materials of the same heading as the product" means that materials of any heading(s) may be used, except those of the same description as the product as given in column 2 of the list.  3.4. When a rule in the list specifies that a product may be manufactured from more than one material, this means that one or more materials may be used. It does not require that all be used.  3.5. Where a rule in the list specifies that a product must be manufactured from a particular material, the rule does not prevent the use of other materials which, because of their inherent nature, cannot satisfy this condition.    EUSFTA Protocol 1 - 52 3.6. Where a rule in the list gives two percentages for the maximum value of non-originating materials that can be used, those percentages may not be added together. In other words, the maximum value of all the non-originating materials used may never exceed the higher of the percentages given. Furthermore, the individual percentages must not be exceeded in relation to the particular materials to which they apply.  Note 4 â General provisions concerning certain agricultural goods  4.1. Agricultural goods which fall within Chapters 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 12 and heading 2401, and which are grown or harvested in the territory of a beneficiary country, shall be treated as originating in the territory of that country, even if grown from seeds, bulbs, rootstock, cuttings, grafts, shoots, buds, or other live parts of plants imported from another country.  4.2. In cases where the content of non originating sugar in a given product is subject to limitations, the weight of sugars of headings 1701 (sucrose) and 1702 (e.g., fructose, glucose, lactose, maltose, isoglucose or invert sugar) used in the manufacture of the final product and used in the manufacture of the non-originating products incorporated in the final product is taken into account for the calculation of such limitations.  Note 5 - Terminology used in respect of certain textile products  5.1. The term "natural fibres" is used in the list to refer to fibres other than artificial or synthetic fibres. It is restricted to the stages before spinning takes place, including waste, and, unless otherwise specified, includes fibres which have been carded, combed or otherwise processed, but not spun.    EUSFTA Protocol 1 - 53 5.2. The term "natural fibres" includes horsehair of heading 0511, silk of headings 5002 and 5003, as well as wool-fibres and fine or coarse animal hair of headings 5101 to 5105, cotton fibres of headings 5201 to 5203, and other vegetable fibres of headings 5301 to 5305.  5.3. The terms "textile pulp", "chemical materials" and "paper-making materials" are used in the list to describe the materials which are not classified in Chapters 50 to 63, but which can be used to manufacture artificial, synthetic or paper fibres or yarns.  5.4. The term "man-made staple fibres" is used in the list to refer to synthetic or artificial filament tow, staple fibres or waste, of headings 5501 to 5507.  Note 6 - Tolerances applicable to products made of a mixture of textile materials  6.1. Where, for a given product in the list, reference is made to this Note, the conditions set out in column 3 shall not be applied to any basic textile materials used in the manufacture of this product and which, taken together, represent 10 % or less of the total weight of all the basic textile materials used. (See also Notes 6.3 and 6.4).  6.2. The tolerance mentioned in Note 6.1 may be applied only to mixed products which have been made from two or more basic textile materials.  The following are the basic textile materials:  â silk;    EUSFTA Protocol 1 - 54 â wool;  â coarse animal hair;  â fine animal hair;  â horsehair;  â cotton;  â paper-making materials and paper;  â flax;  â true hemp;  â jute and other textile bast fibres;  â sisal and other textile fibres of the genus Agave;  â coconut, abaca, ramie and other vegetable textile fibres;  â synthetic man-made filaments;  â artificial man-made filaments;  â current-conducting filaments;    EUSFTA Protocol 1 - 55 â synthetic man-made staple fibres of polypropylene;  â synthetic man-made staple fibres of polyester;  â synthetic man-made staple fibres of polyamide;  â synthetic man-made staple fibres of polyacrylonitrile;  â synthetic man-made staple fibres of polyimide;  â synthetic man-made staple fibres of polytetrafluoroethylene;  â synthetic man-made staple fibres of poly(phenylene sulphide);  â synthetic man-made staple fibres of poly(vinyl chloride);  â other synthetic man-made staple fibres;  â artificial man-made staple fibres of viscose;  â other artificial man-made staple fibres;    EUSFTA Protocol 1 - 56 â yarn made of polyurethane segmented with flexible segments of polyether, whether or not gimped;  â yarn made of polyurethane segmented with flexible segments of polyester, whether or not gimped;  â products of heading 5605 (metallised yarn) incorporating strip consisting of a core of aluminium foil or of a core of plastic film whether or not coated with aluminium powder, of a width not exceeding 5 mm, sandwiched by means of a transparent or coloured adhesive between two layers of plastic film;  â other products of heading 5605;  â glass fibres;  â metal fibres.  Example:  A yarn, of heading 5205, made from cotton fibres of heading 5203 and synthetic staple fibres of heading 5506, is a mixed yarn. Therefore, non-originating synthetic staple fibres which do not satisfy the origin rules may be used, provided that their total weight does not exceed 10 % of the weight of the yarn.    EUSFTA Protocol 1 - 57 Example:  A woollen fabric of heading 5112 that is made from woollen yarn of heading 5107 and synthetic yarn of staple fibres of heading 5509 is a mixed fabric. Therefore, synthetic yarn which does not satisfy the origin rules, or woollen yarn which does not satisfy the origin rules, or a combination of the two, may be used, provided that their total weight does not exceed 10 % of the weight of the fabric.  Example:  Tufted textile fabric of heading 5802 that is made from cotton yarn of heading 5205 and cotton fabric of heading 5210 is only a mixed product if the cotton fabric is itself a mixed fabric made from yarns classified in two separate headings, or if the cotton yarns used are themselves mixtures.  Example:  If the tufted textile fabric concerned had been made from cotton yarn of heading 5205 and synthetic fabric of heading 5407, then, obviously, the yarns used are two separate basic textile materials and the tufted textile fabric is, accordingly, a mixed product.  6.3. In the case of products incorporating "yarn made of polyurethane segmented with flexible segments of polyether, whether or not gimped", this tolerance is 20 % in respect of this yarn.    EUSFTA Protocol 1 - 58 6.4. In the case of products incorporating a "strip consisting of a core of aluminium foil or of a core of plastic film, whether or not coated with aluminium powder, of a width not exceeding 5 mm, sandwiched by means of a transparent or coloured adhesive between two layers of plastic film", the tolerance is 30 % in respect of this strip.  Note 7 - Other tolerances applicable to certain textile products  7.1. Where, in the list, reference is made to this Note, textile materials (with the exception of linings and interlinings) which do not satisfy the rule set out in the list in column 3 for the made-up product concerned may be used, provided that they are classified under a heading other than that of the product, and provided that that their value does not exceed 8 % of the ex-works price of the product.  7.2. Without prejudice to Note 6.3, materials, which are not classified within Chapters 50 to 63, may be used freely in the manufacture of textile products, whether or not they contain textiles.  Example:  If a rule in the list provides that, for a particular textile item (such as trousers), yarn must be used, this does not prevent the use of metal items such as buttons, because buttons are not classified within Chapters 50 to 63. For the same reason, it does not prevent the use of slide-fasteners, even though slide-fasteners normally contain textiles.    EUSFTA Protocol 1 - 59 7.3. Where a percentage rule applies, the value of non-originating materials which are not classified within Chapters 50 to 63 must be taken into account when calculating the value of the non-originating materials incorporated.  Note 8 - Definition of specific processes and simple operations carried out in respect of certain products of Chapter 27  8.1. For the purposes of headings ex 2707 and 2713, the "specific processes" are the following:  (a) vacuum-distillation;  (b) redistillation by a very thorough fractionation process;  (c) cracking;  (d) reforming;  (e) extraction by means of selective solvents;  (f) the process comprising all of the following operations: processing with concentrated sulphuric acid, oleum or sulphuric anhydride; neutralisation with alkaline agents; decolourisation and purification with naturally active earth, activated earth, activated charcoal or bauxite;    EUSFTA Protocol 1 - 60 (g) polymerisation;  (h) alkylation;  (i) isomerisation.  8.2.
