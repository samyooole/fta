procured by the entities specified in Annexes 9-A to 9-C. 
 
 
B. 
Works concessions

equals or exceeds 5 000 000 SDR. 
 
 
EUSFTA Annex 9-F - 3 
Notes to Part 2 of Annex 9-F: 
 
1. 
When awarding work concessions contracts, the Union's procuring entities listed in 
Annexes 9-A and 9-B shall accord services and suppliers of Singapore, including locally 
established suppliers of Singapore, treatment no less favourable than treatment they accord 
to domestic services and suppliers under the Union's domestic regime for works concessions, 
(herein referred to as "national treatment regime"), provided the value of such contracts 
equals or exceeds 5 000 000 SDR. 
 
Under the national treatment regime, the Union, including its Member States and its 
procuring entities, shall: 
 
(a) 
ensure transparency in the award of works concessions contracts, including by the 
publication of notice of intended work concessions; and 
 
(b) 
ensure that there is an effective review procedure through which supplier, including 
suppliers from the other Party may challenge decisions relating to the award of work 
concessions contracts. 
 
2. 
Should the revision of Union's legislation on public procurement result in a further 
clarification or development of rules applicable to works concessions, the Union will, at the 
request of Singapore, review the possibility to reflect these developments in this Annex. 
Following such review the Parties may, by decision of the Committee on Trade in Services, 
Investment and Government Procurement, adapt the provisions applicable to works 
concessions in Chapter Nine (Government Procurement) or in their commitments set out in 
this Annex.
