This Chapter does not apply to measures that affect natural persons seeking access to the employment market of a Party, or to measures regarding citizenship, residence or employment on a permanent basis. Nothing in this Chapter shall prevent a Party from applying measures to regulate the entry of natural persons of the other Party into, or their temporary stay in, its territory, including measures that are necessary to protect the integrity of, and to ensure the orderly movement of natural persons across its borders, provided that such measures are not applied in such a manner as to nullify or impair the benefits1 accruing to the other Party under the terms of this Chapter.   ARTICLE 8.2  Definitions  For the purposes of this Chapter:  (a) "direct taxes" comprises all taxes on total income, on total capital or on elements of income or of capital, including taxes on gains from the alienation of property, taxes on estates, inheritances and gifts, and taxes on the total amounts of wages or salaries paid by enterprises, as well as taxes on capital appreciation;  (b) "juridical person" means any legal entity duly constituted or otherwise organised under applicable law, whether for profit or otherwise, and whether privately-owned or governmentally-owned, including any corporation, trust, partnership, joint venture, sole proprietorship, or association;                                                             1 The sole fact of requiring a visa for natural persons of certain countries and not for those of others shall not be regarded as nullifying or impairing benefits under a specific commitment.

Where applicable, an applicant should be permitted, within reasonable time limits, to resubmit an application.  8. Each Party shall ensure that a licence or an authorisation, once granted, enters into effect without undue delay in accordance with the terms and conditions specified therein.   SUB-SECTION 3  COMPUTER SERVICES   ARTICLE 8.21  Computer Services  1. The Parties subscribe to the understanding set out in the following paragraphs in respect of computer services liberalised in accordance with Section B (Cross-border Supply of Services), Section C (Establishment) and Section D (Temporary Presence of Natural Persons for Business Purposes).  EUSFTA Chapter 8 - 32  2. The Parties understand that CPC18 84, the United Nations code used for describing computer and related services, covers all computer and related services. Technological developments have led to the increased offering of these services as a bundle or package of related services that can include some or all of the basic functions listed in paragraph 3. For example, services such as web or domain hosting, data mining services and grid computing each consist of a combination of basic computer services functions.  3. Computer and related services, regardless of whether they are delivered via a network, including the Internet, include all services that provide any of the following or any combination thereof:  (a) consulting, adaptation, strategy, analysis, planning, specification, design, development, installation, implementation, integration, testing, debugging, updating, support, technical assistance or management of or for computers or computer systems;  (b) consulting, strategy, analysis, planning, specification, design, development, installation, implementation, integration, testing, debugging, updating, adaptation, maintenance, support, technical assistance, management or use of or for software19;                                                             18 "CPC" means the Central Products Classification as set out in Statistical Office of the United Nations, Statistical Papers, Series M, N° 77, CPC prov, 1991. 19 The term "software" means the sets of instructions required to make computers work and communicate. A number of different programmes may be developed for specific applications (application software), and the customer may have a choice of using ready-made programmes off the shelf (packaged software), developing specific programmes for particular requirements (customised software) or using a combination of the two. EUSFTA Chapter 8 - 33  (c) data processing, data storage, data hosting or database services;  (d) maintenance and repair services for office machinery and equipment, including computers; and  (e) training services for staff of clients, related to software, computers or computer systems, and not elsewhere classified.  4. The Parties understand that, in many cases, computer and related services enable the provision of other services20 by both electronic and other means. However, in such cases, there is an important distinction between the computer and related service (e.g., web-hosting or application hosting) and the other service21 enabled by the computer and related service. The other service, regardless of whether it is enabled by a computer and related service, is not covered by CPC 84.                                                              20 E.g.,W/120.1.A.b. (accounting, auditing and bookkeeping services), W/120.1.A.d. (architectural services), W/120.1.A.h. (medical and dental services), W/120.2.D (audiovisual services), W/120.5. (educational services). 21 See previous footnote. EUSFTA Chapter 8 - 34  SUB-SECTION 4  POSTAL SERVICES   ARTICLE 8.22  Prevention of Anti-Competitive Practices in the Postal Sector22  Each Party shall introduce or maintain appropriate measures23 for the purpose of preventing suppliers of postal services who, alone or together, are a major supplier in the relevant market for postal services, from engaging in or continuing anti-competitive practices.   ARTICLE 8.23  Independence of Regulatory Bodies  Regulatory bodies shall be separate from, and shall not be accountable to, any supplier of postal services. The decisions of and the procedures used by regulatory bodies shall be impartial with respect to all market participants.                                                              22 For greater certainty, only measures relating to basic letter services shall be subject to Article 8.22 (Prevention of Anti-Competitive Practices in the Postal Sector). 23 The maintenance of appropriate measures includes the effective enforcement of such measures. EUSFTA Chapter 8 - 35  SUB-SECTION 5  TELECOMMUNICATIONS SERVICES   ARTICLE 8.24  Scope  1. This Sub-Section applies to measures that affect trade in telecommunications services and sets out the principles of the regulatory framework for telecommunications services, liberalised pursuant to Section B to Section D.  2. This Sub-Section does not apply to any measure adopted or maintained by a Party relating to cable or broadcast distribution of radio or television programming.  3. Nothing in this Sub-Section shall be construed as requiring a Party:  (a) to authorise a service supplier of the other Party to establish, construct, acquire, lease, operate, or provide telecommunications transport networks or services, other than as provided for in its Schedule of Specific Commitments; or  (b) to establish, construct, acquire, lease, operate, or provide telecommunications transport networks or services where such networks or services are not offered to the public generally, or to compel any service supplier to do so.  EUSFTA Chapter 8 - 36  4.

For the Union, such procedures entail the analysis by the Union regulators of the relevant product and service markets provided for in the relevant Union legislation, of the designation of a service supplier as having significant market power and the decision of regulators, based upon such analysis, to impose, maintain, amend or withdraw such rights and obligations.   ARTICLE 8.25  Definitions  For the purposes of this Sub-Section:  (a) "broadcasting service" refers to the uninterrupted chain of transmission via wired or wireless means, regardless of the location of the originating transmission, required for the reception or display of aural or visual programme signals by all or any part of the public, but does not cover contribution links between operators;  EUSFTA Chapter 8 - 37  (b) "end-user" means a service consumer or a service supplier to whom a public telecommunications network or service is supplied other than for use in the further supply of a public telecommunications network or service;  (c) "essential facilities" mean facilities of a public telecommunications transport network or service that:  (i) are exclusively or predominantly provided by a single or limited number of suppliers; and  (ii) cannot feasibly be economically or technically substituted in order to provide a service;  (d) "interconnection" means linking with suppliers providing public telecommunications transport networks or services in order to allow the users of one supplier to communicate with users of another supplier and to access services provided by another supplier;  (e) "major supplier" means a supplier of public telecommunications networks or services that has the ability to materially affect the terms of participation in the relevant market for public telecommunications networks or services, having regard to price and supply, as a result of:  (i) control over essential facilities; or  (ii) use of its position in the market;  EUSFTA Chapter 8 - 38  (f) "non-discriminatory" means treatment that is no less favourable than that accorded to any other user of like public telecommunications transport networks or services in like circumstances;  (g) "number portability" means the ability of end-users of public telecommunications networks or services to retain existing telephone numbers at the same location, without impairment of quality, reliability or convenience when switching between like suppliers of public telecommunications networks or services;  (h) "public telecommunications network" means a telecommunications network which a Party requires to provide telecommunications services between defined network termination points;  (i) "public telecommunications service" means any telecommunications service that a Party requires, explicitly or in effect, to be offered to the public generally;  (j) "submarine cable landing station" means the premises and buildings where international submarine cables arrive and terminate and are connected to backhaul links;  (k) "telecommunications" means the transmission and reception of signals by any electromagnetic means;  EUSFTA Chapter 8 - 39  (l) "telecommunications services" means all services consisting of the transmission and reception of electro-magnetic signals, but excludes broadcasting services and economic activities consisting of the provision of content which requires telecommunications for its transport; and  (m) "telecommunications regulatory body" means the national body or bodies charged with the regulation of telecommunications.

Each Party shall ensure that such service suppliers are permitted to:  (a) purchase or lease, and attach terminal or other equipment which interfaces with the public telecommunications network;  EUSFTA Chapter 8 - 40  (b) interconnect private leased or owned circuits with public telecommunications networks and services in its territory, or across its borders, or with circuits leased or owned by other service suppliers; and  (c) use operating protocols of their choice, other than as necessary to ensure the availability of telecommunications networks and services to the public generally.  3. Each Party shall ensure that all service suppliers of the other Party may use public telecommunications networks and services for the movement of information in its territory or across its borders, including for intra-corporate communications of such service suppliers and for access to information contained in databases or otherwise stored in machine-readable form in the territory of either Party. Any new or amended measures of a Party significantly affecting such use shall be notified to the other Party and shall be subject to consultations.   ARTICLE 8.27  Confidentiality of Information  Each Party shall ensure the confidentiality of telecommunications and related traffic data by means of any public telecommunications network or service, without restricting trade in services.   EUSFTA Chapter 8 - 41  ARTICLE 8.28  Interconnection24  1. Each Party shall ensure that any service supplier authorised to provide public telecommunications networks or services has the right and obligation to negotiate interconnection with other suppliers of public telecommunications networks or services. Interconnection should be agreed on the basis of commercial negotiations between the parties concerned.  2. Regulatory authorities shall ensure that suppliers that acquire information from another undertaking during the process of negotiating interconnection arrangements use that information solely for the purpose for which it was supplied, and at all times respect the confidentiality of information transmitted or stored.                                                              24 For the purposes of this Article and Article 8.30 (Conduct of Major Suppliers), designation of a supplier of public telecommunications networks and services as a major supplier shall be in accordance with the domestic law and procedures of each Party. EUSFTA Chapter 8 - 42  ARTICLE 8.29  Interconnection with Major Suppliers  1. Each Party shall ensure that any major supplier in its territory provides interconnection for the facilities and equipment of suppliers of public telecommunications networks or services of the other Party at any technically feasible point in the major supplier's network. Such interconnection shall be provided:  (a) under non-discriminatory terms, conditions (including technical standards and specifications) and rates, and of a quality no less favourable than that provided for the own like services of such major supplier, or for like services of non-affiliated suppliers of public telecommunications networks or services, or for its subsidiaries or other affiliates;  (b) in a timely fashion, on terms, conditions (including technical standards and specifications), and cost-oriented rates that are transparent, are reasonable, having regard to economic feasibility, and are sufficiently unbundled so that the supplier need not pay for network components or facilities that it does not require for the service to be provided; and  (c) upon request, at points in addition to the network termination points offered to the majority of suppliers of public telecommunications networks or services, subject to charges that reflect the cost of construction of necessary additional facilities.  EUSFTA Chapter 8 - 43  2. Each Party shall ensure that major suppliers in its territory make publicly available their interconnection agreements or a reference interconnection offer.  3. The procedures applicable for interconnection to a major supplier shall be made publicly available.  4. When suppliers of public telecommunications networks or services are unable to resolve disputes regarding the terms, conditions and rates on which interconnection is to be provided by a major supplier, they shall have recourse to the regulatory authority, which shall aim to resolve the disputes in the shortest possible timeframe and in any case within 180 days of the referral to it, provided that the resolution of complex disputes may take longer than 180 days.   ARTICLE 8.30  Conduct of Major Suppliers  1. Each Party may impose obligations of non-discrimination on major suppliers in relation to interconnection or access.  2. Obligations of non-discrimination shall ensure, in particular, that the major supplier applies equivalent conditions in equivalent circumstances to other suppliers providing equivalent services and provides services and information to others under equivalent conditions and of the same quality as it provides for its own services or for the services of its subsidiaries or partners.   EUSFTA Chapter 8 - 44  ARTICLE 8.31  Competitive Safeguards on Major Suppliers  Each Party shall introduce or maintain appropriate measures25 for the purpose of preventing suppliers of public telecommunications networks or services who, alone or together, are a major supplier in its territory from engaging in or continuing anti-competitive practices. These anti-competitive practices shall include in particular:  (a) engaging in anti-competitive cross-subsidisation or margin squeeze;  (b) using information obtained from competitors with anti-competitive results;  (c) not making available to suppliers of public telecommunications networks or services, on a timely basis, technical information about essential facilities and commercially relevant information which are necessary for them to provide public telecommunications services;  (d) pricing services in a manner that is likely to unreasonably restrict competition, such as predatory pricing.                                                              25 The maintenance of appropriate measures includes the effective enforcement of such measures. EUSFTA Chapter 8 - 45  ARTICLE 8.32  Unbundled Network Elements  1. Each Party shall impose obligations on major suppliers to meet reasonable requests for access to, and use of, specific network elements and associated facilities at any technically feasible point, on an unbundled basis, in a timely fashion and on terms and conditions that are reasonable, transparent, and non-discriminatory, and in particular:  (a) to give access to specified network elements and/or facilities, including access to network elements which are not active, and/or unbundled access to the local loop to, inter alia, allow subscriber line resale offers;  (b) to grant open access to technical interfaces, protocols or other key technologies that are indispensable for the interoperability of services or virtual network services;  (c) to provide co-location; and  (d) to provide services required to ensure interoperability of end-to-end services to users.  2. When a Party is considering the obligations referred in paragraph 1, it may take account of, inter alia, the following factors:  (a) the technical and economic viability of using or installing competing facilities, taking into account the nature and type of interconnection and access involved, including the viability of other upstream access products such as access to ducts;  EUSFTA Chapter 8 - 46  (b) the feasibility of providing the access proposed, in relation to the capacity available;  (c) the initial investment by the facility owner, taking into account the risks involved in making the investment; and  (d) the need to safeguard effective and sustainable competition.   ARTICLE 8.33  Co-location  1. Each Party shall ensure that major suppliers in its territory provide to suppliers of public telecommunications networks or services of the other Party physical co-location of equipment necessary for interconnection or access to unbundled network elements in a timely fashion and on terms and conditions that are reasonable and non-discriminatory.  2. Each Party may determine in accordance with its domestic law the locations at which it requires major suppliers in its territory to provide co-location under paragraph 1.   EUSFTA Chapter 8 - 47  ARTICLE 8.34  Resale  Each Party shall ensure that major suppliers in its territory offer for resale to suppliers of public telecommunications networks or services of the other Party, public telecommunications services that such major suppliers provide at retail to end-users in accordance with the provisions of this Sub-Section and, in particular, with Article 8.32 (Unbundled Network Elements).   ARTICLE 8.35  Facility Sharing  1. Each Party shall be able, taking into account the principle of proportionality, to impose on any major supplier having the right to install facilities on, over or under public or private property, the sharing of such facilities or property, including buildings, entries to buildings, building wiring, masts, antennae, towers and other supporting constructions, poles, ducts, conduits, manholes and cabinets.  2. Each Party may determine in accordance with its domestic law the facilities to which it requires major suppliers in its territory to provide access under paragraph 1, on the basis that such facilities cannot feasibly be economically or technically substituted in order to provide a competing service.   EUSFTA Chapter 8 - 48  ARTICLE 8.36  Provisioning of Leased Circuits Services  Each Party shall ensure that major suppliers of leased circuits services in its territory provide juridical persons of the other Party leased circuits services that are public telecommunications services in a timely fashion on terms and conditions that are reasonable, non-discriminatory and transparent.   ARTICLE 8.37  Number Portability  Each Party shall ensure that suppliers of public telecommunications services in its territory provide number portability for those services designated by that Party, to the extent technically feasible, on a timely basis and on reasonable terms and conditions.   ARTICLE 8.38  Submarine Cable Landing Stations  Each Party shall ensure access to submarine cable systems, including landing facilities, in its territory, where a supplier is authorised to operate a submarine cable system as a public telecommunications service, on reasonable, non-discriminatory and transparent terms and conditions.   EUSFTA Chapter 8 - 49  ARTICLE 8.39  Independent Regulatory Authority  1. Each Party shall ensure that its telecommunications regulatory body is separate from, and not accountable to, any supplier of public telecommunications networks or services or telecommunications equipment. To this end, each Party shall ensure that its telecommunications regulatory body does not hold any financial interest or control in such a supplier.  2. Each Party shall ensure that the decisions of, and procedures followed by, its telecommunications regulatory bodies are fair and impartial with respect to all market participants and that they are made and implemented without undue delay. To this end, each Party shall ensure that any financial interest that it holds in a supplier of public telecommunications networks or services does not influence the decisions of, and procedures followed by, its telecommunications regulatory body.  3. The powers of the regulatory authorities shall be exercised transparently in accordance with the applicable domestic law.  4. Regulatory authorities shall have the power to ensure that suppliers of telecommunications transport networks and services within their respective territories provide them, promptly upon request, with all the information, including financial information, which is necessary to enable the regulatory authorities to carry out their tasks in accordance with this Sub-Section. Information requested shall be reasonably proportionate to the performance of the regulatory authorities' tasks and treated in accordance with the requirements of confidentiality.  EUSFTA Chapter 8 - 50  5. The regulatory authority shall be sufficiently empowered to regulate the sector. The tasks to be undertaken by a regulatory authority shall be made public in an easily accessible and clear form, in particular where those tasks are assigned to more than one body.   ARTICLE 8.40  Universal Services  1. Each Party has the right to define the kind of universal service obligations that it wishes to maintain.  2. Such obligations will not be regarded as anti-competitive per se, provided that they are administered in a transparent, objective, non-discriminatory and competitively neutral manner and are not more burdensome than necessary for the kind of universal service defined by the Party.  3. Where a Party requires a supplier of telecommunications services to provide directories of subscribers, that Party shall ensure that the supplier applies the principle of non-discrimination to the treatment of information that has been provided to them by other suppliers of such telecommunications services.   EUSFTA Chapter 8 - 51  ARTICLE 8.41  Authorisation to Provide Telecommunications Services  1. Each Party shall ensure that licensing procedures are as simple as possible and do not unduly complicate or delay the provisions of the service.  2. Where a Party requires a supplier of public telecommunications networks or services to have a licence, that Party shall make publicly available:  (a) all the licensing criteria, terms, conditions and procedures it applies; and  (b) a reasonable period of time that would normally be required to reach a decision concerning an application for a licence.  3. Each Party shall ensure that, if it so requests, the applicant receives in writing the reasons for the denial of a licence.  4. Where a licence has been unduly denied, the applicant for a licence shall be able to seek recourse before an appeal body.  5. Any licensing or authorisation fees26 which the applicants may incur from their application should be reasonable and should not in themselves restrict the supply of the service.                                                              26 Licensing or authorisation fees do not include payments for auction, tendering or other non-discriminatory means of awarding concessions, or mandated contributions to universal service provision. EUSFTA Chapter 8 - 52  ARTICLE 8.42  Allocation and Use of Scarce Resources  1. Any procedures for the allocation and use of scarce resources, including frequencies, numbers and rights of way, shall be carried out in an objective, timely, transparent and non-discriminatory manner. The current state of allocated frequency bands shall be made publicly available, but detailed identification of frequencies allocated for specific government uses is not required.  2. The Parties understand that decisions on allocating and assigning spectrum and frequency management are not measures that are per se inconsistent with Articles 8.5 (Market Access) and 8.10 (Market Access). Accordingly, each Party retains the right to exercise its spectrum and frequency management policies, which may affect the number of suppliers of public telecommunications services, provided that this is done in a manner that is consistent with this Chapter. The Parties also retain the right to allocate frequency bands in a manner that takes existing and future needs into account.   ARTICLE 8.43  Enforcement  1. Each Party shall ensure that its telecommunications regulatory body maintains appropriate procedures and has the authority to enforce domestic measures relating to the obligations under this Sub-Section. Such procedures and authority shall include the ability to impose timely, proportionate and effective sanctions, and the ability to modify, suspend, and revoke licences.  EUSFTA Chapter 8 - 53  2. Where a major supplier refuses the application of the rights and obligations provided for in Article 8.29 (Interconnection with Major Suppliers), Article 8.30 (Conduct of Major Suppliers), Article 8.31 (Competitive Safeguards on Major Suppliers), Article 8.32 (Unbundled Network Elements), Article 8.33 (Co-location), Article 8.34 (Resale), Article 8.35 (Facility Sharing) or Article 8.36 (Provisioning of Leased Circuit Services), the requesting service supplier may seek the intervention of the regulatory body, which shall issue, in accordance with its domestic law, a binding decision , in the shortest possible period of time, and in any case within a reasonable period of time.   ARTICLE 8.44  Resolution of Telecommunications Disputes  1. Each Party shall ensure that suppliers of public telecommunications networks or services of the other Party have timely recourse to a telecommunications regulatory body or other relevant body to resolve disputes arising under domestic measures that address a matter set out in this Sub-Section.  2. Each Party shall ensure that any supplier of public telecommunications networks or services of the other Party that is affected by a decision of its telecommunications regulatory body may appeal against that decision to a judicial or administrative authority independent of the parties involved.  3. Where the appeal body is not judicial in character, written reasons for its decision shall be given and its decision shall be subject to review by an impartial and independent judicial authority.  EUSFTA Chapter 8 - 54  4. Decisions taken by appeal bodies shall be effectively implemented by the parties concerned in accordance with the applicable domestic law and internal procedures. An appeal shall not relieve a party concerned of its obligation to comply with the underlying regulatory decision unless an appropriate authority has stayed that regulatory decision.   ARTICLE 8.45  Transparency  When regulatory bodies intend to take measures related to the provisions of this Sub-Section, they shall give interested parties the opportunity to comment on the draft measure within a reasonable period of time, in accordance with their domestic law. Regulatory bodies shall make their consultation procedures for such draft measures publicly available. The results of the consultation procedure should be made publicly available by the regulatory body except in the case of confidential information in accordance with the domestic law on business confidentiality.   ARTICLE 8.46  Flexibility in the Choice of Technologies  Neither Party shall prevent suppliers of public telecommunications services from having the flexibility to choose the technologies that they use to supply their services, subject to the ability of each Party to take measures to ensure that end-users of different networks are able to communicate with each other.   EUSFTA Chapter 8 - 55  ARTICLE 8.47  Relationship to other Sub-Sections, Sections and Chapters  In the event of any inconsistency between this Sub-Section and another Sub-Section or Section in this Chapter or another Chapter, this Sub-Section shall prevail to the extent of such inconsistency.   ARTICLE 8.48  Cooperation  1. The Parties, recognising the rapid development of the telecommunications and information technology industry, both in the domestic and international contexts, shall cooperate to promote the development of such services with a view to obtaining the maximum benefit for the Parties from the use of telecommunications and information technology.  2. The areas of cooperation may include the following:  (a) exchanging views on policy issues such as the regulatory framework for high speed broadband networks and the reduction of international mobile roaming charges; and  (b) promoting the use by consumers, the public sector and the private sector of telecommunications and information technology services, including newly emerging services.  EUSFTA Chapter 8 - 56  3. The forms of cooperation may include the following:  (a) promoting dialogue on policy issues;  (b) enhancing cooperation in international fora relating to telecommunications and information technology; and  (c) other forms of cooperation activities.   SUB-SECTION 6  FINANCIAL SERVICES   ARTICLE 8.49  Scope and Definitions  1.

EUSFTA Chapter 8 - 61  ARTICLE 8.50  Prudential Carve-out  1. Nothing in this Agreement shall be construed to prevent a Party from adopting or maintaining reasonable measures for prudential reasons, such as:  (a) the protection of investors, depositors, policy-holders or persons to whom a fiduciary duty is owed by a financial service supplier;  (b) the maintenance of the safety, soundness, integrity or financial responsibility of financial service suppliers; or  (c) ensuring the integrity and stability of the Party's financial system.  2. These measures shall not be more burdensome than necessary to achieve their aim, and shall not constitute a means of arbitrary or unjustifiable discrimination against financial service suppliers of the other Party in comparison to its own like financial service suppliers, or a disguised restriction on trade in services.  3. Nothing in this Agreement shall be construed as requiring a Party to disclose information relating to the affairs and accounts of individual consumers or to disclose any confidential or proprietary information in the possession of public entities.  EUSFTA Chapter 8 - 62  4. Each Party shall use its best endeavours to ensure that the Basel Committee's "Core Principles for Effective Banking Supervision", the standards and principles of the International Association of Insurance Supervisors and the International Organisation of Securities Commissions' "Objectives and Principles of Securities Regulation", and the internationally agreed Standard for transparency and exchange of information for tax purposes, as spelled out in the 2017 OECD Model Tax Convention on Income and on Capital, are implemented and applied in its territory.  5. Subject to Article 8.6 (National Treatment) and without prejudice to other means of prudential regulation of cross-border trade in financial services, a Party may require the registration or authorisation of cross-border financial service suppliers of the other Party and of financial instruments.   ARTICLE 8.51  Self-regulatory Organisations  When membership or participation in, or access to, any self-regulatory organisation is required by a Party in order for financial service suppliers of the other Party to supply financial services in or into the territory of the first Party, the Party shall ensure observance of the obligations under Article 8.6 (National Treatment) and Article 8.11 (National Treatment) by such self-regulatory organisation.

SUB-SECTION 7  INTERNATIONAL MARITIME TRANSPORT SERVICES   ARTICLE 8.56  Scope, Definitions and Principles  1. This Sub-Section sets out the principles regarding the liberalisation of international maritime transport services pursuant to Sections B (Cross-border Supply of Services), C (Establishment) and D (Temporary Presence of Natural Persons for Business Purposes).  EUSFTA Chapter 8 - 66  2. For the purposes of this Sub-Section, "international maritime transport" includes door-to-door and multi-modal transport operations, which means the carriage of goods using more than one mode of transport, and which involves a sea-leg, where such carriage takes place under a single transport document, and to this effect involves the right to contract directly with providers of other modes of transport.  3. As regards international maritime transport, the Parties agree to ensure the effective application of the principles of unrestricted access to cargoes on a commercial basis, the freedom to supply international maritime transport services, as well as national treatment in the framework of the supply of such services.  In view of the existing levels of liberalisation between the Parties in international maritime transport:  (a) the Parties shall effectively apply the principle of unrestricted access to the international maritime transport markets and trades on a commercial and non-discriminatory basis; and  (b) each Party shall grant to ships flying the flag of the other Party or operated by service suppliers of the other Party treatment no less favourable than the treatment that the granting Party accords to its own ships or those of any third country, whichever is better, with regard to, inter alia, access to ports, the use of infrastructure and auxiliary maritime services of the ports, as well as with regard to related fees and charges, customs facilities and access to berths and facilities for loading and unloading.  EUSFTA Chapter 8 - 67  4. In applying these principles, the Parties shall:  (a) not introduce cargo-sharing arrangements in future agreements with third countries concerning maritime transport services, including dry and liquid bulk and liner trade, and shall terminate, within a reasonable period of time, any such cargo-sharing arrangements that exist in previous agreements; and  (b) upon the entry into force of this Agreement, abolish and abstain from introducing any unilateral measures27 or administrative, technical and other obstacles which could constitute a disguised restriction or could have discriminatory effects on the free supply of services in international maritime transport.  5. Each Party shall permit international maritime transport service suppliers of the other Party to have an establishment in its territory under conditions of establishment and operation in accordance with the conditions inscribed in its Schedule of Specific Commitments.  6. The Parties shall make the use of the following services at the port available to international maritime transport suppliers of the other Party on reasonable and non-discriminatory terms and conditions:  (a) pilotage;  (b) towing and tug assistance;                                                             27 For the purposes of this subparagraph, the term "measures" shall comprise only measures that adversely discriminate based on the nationality or geographic area(s) of origin of the natural or juridical person to which the measure is applied. EUSFTA Chapter 8 - 68  (c) provisioning;  (d) fuelling and watering;  (e) garbage collecting and ballast waste disposal;  (f) port captain's services;  (g) navigation aids;  (h) shore-based operational services that are essential to ship operations, including communications, water and electrical supplies; and  (i) emergency repair facilities, anchorage, berth and berthing services.

SECTION G  GENERAL PROVISIONS   ARTICLE 8.62  General Exceptions  Subject to the requirement that such measures are not applied in a manner which would constitute a means of arbitrary or unjustifiable discrimination against the other Party where like conditions prevail, or a disguised restriction on establishment or cross-border supply of services, nothing in this Chapter shall be construed to prevent the adoption or enforcement by a Party of measures:  (a) necessary to protect public security or public morals or to maintain public order28;  (b) necessary to protect human, animal or plant life or health;                                                             28 The public order exception may be invoked only where a genuine and sufficiently serious threat is posed to one of the fundamental interests of society.
