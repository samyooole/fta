SINGAPORE 
 
SCHEDULE OF SPECIFIC COMMITMENTS 
 
EXPLANATORY NOTES 
 
1. 
The classification of service sectors in this schedule is based on the 1991 provisional Central 
Product Classification (CPC) of the United Nations Statistical Office unless otherwise 
indicated by the absence of a CPC number. The ordering reflects the services sectoral 
classification list as used in the GATT document MTN.GNS/W/120 dated 10 July 1991. The 
scheduling of specific commitments follows the guidelines stated in GATT documents 
MTN.GNS/W/164 dated 3 September 1993 and MTN.GNS/W/164/Add.1 dated 
30 November 1993. 
 
2. 
The use of "**" against individual CPC codes indicates that the specific commitment for that 
code shall not extend to the total range of services covered under that code. 
 
3. 
The classification of establishment sectors in this schedule is based on the International 
Standard Industrial Classification (ISIC) Revision 3 of the United Nations Statistical Office. As 
necessary and appropriate, Singapore could specify the exact coverage of the commitment if 
the commitment does not exactly conform to the classification system. 
 
 
 
EUSFTA Appendix 8-B-1- 2 
 
4. 
The list of commitments below (hereinafter referred to as "this Schedule") indicates the 
service sectors liberalised pursuant to Article 8.7 (Schedule of Specific Commitments) and 
Article 8.12 (Schedule of Specific Commitments), and, by means of reservations, the market 
access and national treatment limitations that apply to services and service suppliers of the 
Union in those sectors. This Schedule is composed of the following elements: 
 
(a) 
the first column, which indicates the sector or subsector in which the commitment is 
undertaken by Singapore, and the scope of liberalisation to which the reservations 
apply; 
 
(b) 
the second column, which describes the applicable reservations to Article 8.5 (Market 
Access) and Article 8.10 (Market Access) in the sector or subsector indicated in the first 
column; 
 
(c) 
the third column, which describes the applicable reservations to Article 8.6 (National 
Treatment) and Article 8.11 (National Treatment) in the sector or subsector indicated 
in the first column; and 
 
(d) 
the fourth column, which describes specific commitments on measures affecting the 
cross-border supply of services and establishment in service sectors not subject to 
scheduling under Article 8.5 (Market Access) and Article 8.10 (Market Access) and 
Article 8.6 (National Treatment) and Article 8.11 (National Treatment). 
 
 
 
EUSFTA Appendix 8-B-1- 3 
 
5. 
Notwithstanding Article 8.10 (Market Access), non-discriminatory requirements as regards 
the types of legal form of an establishment do not need to be specified in this Schedule in 
order to be maintained or adopted by Singapore. 
 
6. 
This Schedule does not include measures relating to qualification requirements and 
procedures, technical standards and licensing requirements when they do not constitute a 
market access or a national treatment limitation within the meaning of Article 8.5 (Market 
Access) and Article 8.10 (Market Access) and Article 8.6 (National Treatment) and 
Article 8.11 (National Treatment). Those measures (e.g. need to obtain a license, universal 
service obligations, need to obtain recognition of qualifications in regulated sectors, and 
need to pass specific examinations, including language examinations and need to have a 
legal domicile in the territory where the economic activity is performed), even if not listed, 
apply in any case to services and service suppliers of the Union. 
 
7. 
In accordance with paragraph 2(a) of Article 8.1 (Objective and Scope), this Schedule shall 
not apply to subsidies or grants provided by a Party, including government-supported loans, 
guarantees, and insurance.

Due to the gradual liberalisation process of Singapore's legal services market, Singapore cannot yet commit to further market access in this sector. The Parties will, with a 
view to granting further market access, review their commitments in legal services no later than two years after entry into force of the EUSFTA. The Trade Committee may 
amend either Party’s schedules in this respect.

Commitments. All the commitments in this Schedule are also subject to entry requirements, admission criteria, 
domestic laws, guidelines, rules and regulations, terms and conditions of the Monetary Authority of Singapore

public 
1) Unbound 
2) None 
3) These measures are also 
limitations on national treatment. 
Only institutions licensed or 
approved as banks, merchant 
banks and finance companies can 
accept deposits. This measure is 
not discriminatory. 
Foreign banks can operate from 
only one office (excluding 
back-office operations) unless 
otherwise specified in this 
schedule. They cannot establish 
off-premise ATMs and ATM 
networking and new sub-branches

Commercial banks 
If Singapore commits with 
countries, with at least one full 
bank licence with qualifying full 
bank (QFB) privileges other than 
the United States of America, to 
offer one or more new full bank 
licences with QFB privileges after 
the date of this Agreement comes 
into force, the number of 
additional new full bank licences 
with QFB privileges will be offered 
to the EU. Other than the EU, only 
Australia, China, India, Malaysia 
and the United States of America 
have one or more full bank licences 
with QFB privileges. 
 
 
EUSFTA Appendix 8-B-1- 79 
 
 
Location of banks and relocation of 
banks and sub-branches require 
prior approval from MAS. This 
limitation will not be used as a 
means of arbitrary and 
unjustifiable discrimination against 
EU banks or disguised restriction 
on trade in services to the 
competitive advantage of local 
incumbents. 
 
If Singapore allows a foreign QFB, 
other than from the US, to have 
more than 50 customer service 
locations, the same privilege 
should also be given to significantly 
rooted EU QFBs. 
 
 
EUSFTA Appendix 8-B-1- 80 
 
 
None, except the following 
electronic retail banking services: 
opening of accounts by new 
customers16, acceptance of 
deposits, dispensing of legal tender 
notes and coins, and application for 
unsecured credit facilities17. These 
measures shall be non-
discriminatory, be non-arbitrary 
and shall not include any economic 
needs test. For greater clarity, 
none of these measures shall apply 
to wholesale banks, offshore banks 
and merchant banks.

For the purpose of this limitation, 
electronic banking services are 
provided over points of access not 
arranged by the bank, such as 
mobile personal retail banking, 
home internet retail banking and as 
such technology may evolve. 
Establishment and operation of 
commercial foreign banks, 
merchant banks and finance 
companies are also subject to the 
limitations listed under activities 
B(a) to B(l) and the following 
limitations: 
 
 
 
 
 
EUSFTA Appendix 8-B-1- 82 
 
 
Commercial banks 
No new full bank licence will be 
granted to foreign banks, unless 
otherwise specified in additional 
commitments. 
Any EU bank with qualifying full 
bank ("QFB") privileges will be 
allowed to establish up to an 
additional 25 customer service 
locations (of which up to 10 may be 
established as branches), over and 
above the EU bank's existing limit 
of 25 customer service locations if 
and only if the MAS has 
determined that the EU bank is 
significantly rooted in Singapore. 
 
 
 
 
EUSFTA Appendix 8-B-1- 83 
 
 
In determining whether the EU 
bank is significantly rooted in 
Singapore, MAS will consider the 
following: 
(a) 
the EU bank must, at a 
minimum, incorporate its 
retail banking operations; 
(b) 
a simple majority of the 
Board of the EU bank's local 
subsidiary must be 
Singaporeans, Permanent 
Residents or a combination 
thereof; 
 
 
 
 
EUSFTA Appendix 8-B-1- 84 
 
 
(c) 
MAS is satisfied that the EU 
bank and the local subsidiary 
where applicable serves a 
comprehensive spectrum of 
the local community in 
Singapore and in principle, 
respects the key initiatives of 
any industry-wide 
associations; 
 
 
 
 
EUSFTA Appendix 8-B-1- 85 
 
 
(d) 
MAS is satisfied that the EU 
bank is committed to 
Singapore's financial stability 
and development in the long 
term. For example, MAS will 
consider the number of 
persons which the EU bank 
employs in Singapore and its 
willingness to support 
Singapore's financial stability; 
 
 
 
 
EUSFTA Appendix 8-B-1- 86 
 
 
(e) 
Singapore is one of the EU 
bank's significant markets 
contributing a significant part 
of profits and assets to the 
EU bank's global banking 
group18; 
(f) 
major business lines are 
headquartered in Singapore 
and the key decision makers 
of the business lines are 
resident in Singapore. 
 
 
                                                           
18 
"EU bank's global banking group" means the parent company of the EU bank (or the EU bank, as the case may be, where it is not owned or controlled by a parent company) 
and its group of companies which are consolidated according to accounting standards in the jurisdiction where the parent company is incorporated or established. 
 
 
EUSFTA Appendix 8-B-1- 87 
 
 
For avoidance of doubt, the local 
subsidiary must hold the Full Bank 
licence with the QFB privileges and 
is the entity which would be 
allowed to establish up to an 
additional 25 customer service 
locations (of which up to 10 may be 
established as branches). 
 
 
 
 
EUSFTA Appendix 8-B-1- 88 
 
 
A QFB may, with the prior approval 
of the MAS, enter into any 
arrangement with a local bank for 
access to the ATM network of the 
local bank for the purpose of 
permitting a cardholder of the QFB 
to obtain cash advances from his 
credit or charge card account, as 
the case may be. Where such an 
application for approval is made by 
the QFB, it would be granted as a 
matter of course, subject to such 
conditions as the MAS may impose. 
 
 
 
 
EUSFTA Appendix 8-B-1- 89 
 
 
QFBs may provide debit services on 
an Electronic Funds Transfer at 
Point of Sale (EFTPOS) network. 
 
Wholesale banks 
12 EU banks holding wholesale 
bank licenses, upon application to 
the MAS, will be allowed to 
operate up to 2 customer service 
locations each. 
Singapore commits to review the 
possibility of increasing the number 
of banks allowed to benefit from 
customer service locations once 
they are awarded to 12 EU banks.  
 
 
 
 
EUSFTA Appendix 8-B-1- 90 
 
 
Only a maximum of 20 new 
wholesale bank licenses will be 
granted by MAS and/or its 
successor body between 1 January 
2013 to 31 December 2014. 
Quantitative limits on the number 
of wholesale bank licences will be 
removed for EU banks with or 
without operations in Singapore, 
3 years after the date of entry into 
force of this Agreement and such 
banks may be admitted directly as 
wholesale banks. 
 
 
 
 
EUSFTA Appendix 8-B-1- 91 
 
 
Wholesale banks are not permitted 
to: 
(a)

savings accounts without 
MAS' prior approval;

successor body are complied 
with.

No foreign person shall, acting 
alone or in concert with other 
persons, assume control of any 
Singapore-incorporated bank or 
company, belonging to a class of 
financial institutions approved as 
financial holding companies under 
section 28 of the Monetary 
Authority of Singapore Act 
(referred to as a financial holding 
company) or approved, designated 
or otherwise regulated as financial 
holding companies under other 
laws and regulations.
