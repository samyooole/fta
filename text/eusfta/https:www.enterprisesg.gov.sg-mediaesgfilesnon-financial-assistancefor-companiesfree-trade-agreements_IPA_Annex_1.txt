 EUSFTA-IPA Annex 1 - 1  ANNEX 1   EXPROPRIATION  The Parties confirm their shared understanding that:  1. Article 2.6 (Expropriation) addresses two situations. The first is direct expropriation, where a covered investment is nationalised or otherwise directly expropriated through formal transfer of title or outright seizure. The second is indirect expropriation, where a measure or series of measures by a Party has an effect equivalent to direct expropriation in that it substantially deprives the covered investor of the fundamental attributes of property in its covered investment, including the right to use, enjoy and dispose of its covered investment, without formal transfer of title or outright seizure.  2. The determination of whether a measure or series of measures by a Party, in a specific situation, constitutes an indirect expropriation requires a case-by-case, fact-based inquiry that considers, among other factors:  (a) the economic impact of the measure or series of measures and its duration, although the fact that a measure or a series of measures by a Party has an adverse effect on the economic value of an investment, standing alone, does not establish that an indirect expropriation has occurred;   EUSFTA-IPA Annex 1 - 2  (b) the extent to which the measure or series of measures interferes with the possibility to use, enjoy or dispose of the property; and  (c) the character of the measure or series of measures, notably its object, context and intent.  For greater certainty, except in the rare circumstance where the impact of a measure or series of measures is so severe in light of its purpose that it appears manifestly excessive, non-discriminatory measure or series of measures by a Party that are designed and applied to protect legitimate public policy objectives such as public health, safety and the environment, do not constitute indirect expropriation.   ________________
