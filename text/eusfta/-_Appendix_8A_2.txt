measures (e.g. requirements to obtain a license, universal service obligations, requirements 
to obtain recognition of qualifications in regulated sectors, requirements to pass specific 
examinations, including language examinations, and non-discriminatory requirements that 
certain activities may not be carried out in environmental protected zones or areas of

service in its territory, a reservation listed in the list of commitments in Appendix 8-A-3 
pursuant to Article 8.13 (Scope and Definitions) with respect to temporary movement of 
natural persons shall operate as a reservation with respect to the commitments on 
establishment taken in this Appendix in conformity with Article 8.12 (Schedule of Specific

ALL SECTORS 
Investment 
DK: The establishment of branches by foreign companies outside the Union depend on 
whether the relevant country has agreed in an international agreement. Retail planning 
in Denmark is regulated by the Planning Act and has criteria for the size and location of 
stores for retail business. Regulations on size and location are only based on 
environmental matters. Therefore foreign business of retail does not need a special 
authorisation or permit before investing in Demark.

through companies or other entities controlled directly or indirectly by foreign 
governments, needs prior authorisation by the government. 
BG: In enterprises where the public (State or municipal) share in the equity capital 
exceeds 30 per cent, the transfer of those shares to third parties needs authorisation. 
Certain economic activities related to the exploitation or use of State or public property 
are subject to concessions granted under the provisions of the Concessions Act. Foreign 
investors cannot participate in privatisation. Foreign investors and Bulgarian juridical 
persons with controlling Singaporean participation require permission for:

rights in existing French enterprises, or 20 per cent in publicly quoted French companies, 
are subject to the following regulations:

investments of less than 7,6 million euros in French enterprises that have a 
turnover not exceeding 76 million euros are free, subject to a 15-day period 
following prior notification and verification that these amounts are met; 
– 
after a period of one month following prior notification, authorisation is tacitly 
granted for other investments unless the Minister of Economic Affairs has, in 
exceptional circumstances, exercised its right to postpone the investment. 
Foreign participation in newly privatised companies may be limited to a variable amount, 
determined by the government of France on a case by case basis, of the equity offered to 
the public. For establishing in certain commercial, industrial or artisanal activities, a 
specific authorisation is needed if the managing director is not a holder of a permanent 
residence permit.

Due to the gradual liberalisation process of Singapore's legal services market, Singapore cannot yet commit to further market access in this sector. The Parties will, 
with a view to granting further market access, review their commitments in legal services no later than two years after entry into force of this Agreement. The 
Parties may, by decisions in the Committee on Services, Investment and Government Procurement established pursuant to Article 16.2 (Specialised Committees) 
amend either Party's schedules in this respect.

Includes legal advisory services, legal representational services, legal arbitration and conciliation/mediation services, and legal documentation and certification 
services. Provision of legal services is only authorised in respect of public international law, Union law and the law of any jurisdiction where the service supplier or its 
personnel is qualified to practice as a lawyer, and, like the provision of other services, is subject to licensing requirements and procedures applicable in the Member 
States of the Union. For lawyers providing legal services in respect of public international law and foreign law, these licensing requirements and procedures may 
take, inter alia, the form of compliance with local codes of ethics, use of home title (unless recognition with the host title has been obtained), insurance 
requirements, simple registration with the host country Bar or a simplified admission to the host country Bar through an aptitude test and a legal or professional 
domicile in the host country. Legal services in respect of Union law shall in principle be carried out by or through a fully qualified lawyer admitted to the Bar in a 
Member State of the Union acting personally, and legal services in respect of the law of a Member State of the Union shall in principle be carried out by or through a 
fully qualified lawyer admitted to the Bar in that Member State acting personally. Full admission to the Bar in the relevant Member State of the Union might 
therefore be necessary for representation before courts and other competent authorities in the Union since it involves practice of Union and national procedural 
law. However, in some Member States, foreign lawyers not fully admitted to the Bar are allowed to represent in civil proceedings a party being a national of or 
belonging to the State in which the lawyer is entitled to practice.
