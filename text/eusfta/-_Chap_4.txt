the information can be made available to the public. 
 
 
EUSFTA Chapter 4 - 4 
 ARTICLE 4.6 
 
Technical Regulations 
 
The Parties agree to make best use of good regulatory practice with regard to the 
preparation, adoption and application of technical regulations, as provided for in the TBT 
Agreement including: 
 
(a)  considering, when developing a technical regulation, inter alia, the impact of the 
envisaged technical regulation and the available regulatory and non-regulatory 
alternatives to the proposed technical regulation which may fulfil the Party's 
legitimate objectives; 
 
(b)  using, consistent with Article 2.4 of the TBT Agreement and to the maximum extent 
possible, relevant international standards as a basis for their technical regulations, 
except when such international standards would be an ineffective or inappropriate 
means for the fulfilment of the legitimate objectives pursued; where international 
standards have not been used as a basis, to explain upon request to the other Party 
the reasons why such standards have been considered inappropriate or ineffective for 
the aim pursued; and 
 
(c)  specifying, consistent with Article 2.8 of the TBT Agreement and wherever 
appropriate, technical regulations based on product requirements in terms of 
performance rather than in terms of design or descriptive characteristics. 
 
 
EUSFTA Chapter 4 - 5 
 ARTICLE 4.7 
 
Conformity Assessment Procedures 
 
1.  The Parties recognise that a broad range of mechanisms exist to facilitate the 
acceptance of the results of conformity assessment procedures, including: 
 
(a)  the importing Party's reliance on a supplier's declaration of conformity; 
 
(b)  agreements on mutual acceptance of the results of conformity assessment procedures 
with respect to specific technical regulations conducted by bodies located in the 
territory of the other Party; 
 
(c)  the use of accreditation procedures to qualify conformity assessment bodies; 
 
(d)  government designation of conformity assessment bodies, including bodies located in 
the territory of the other Party; 
 
(e)  unilateral recognition by a Party of the results of conformity assessment procedures 
conducted in the territory of the other Party; 
 
(f)  voluntary arrangements between conformity assessment bodies in the respective 
territories of each Party; and 
 
EUSFTA Chapter 4 - 6 
 (g)  the use of regional or international multilateral recognition agreements and 
arrangements of which the Parties are parties. 
 
2.  Having regard, in particular, to those considerations, the Parties shall: 
 
(a)  intensify their exchange of information regarding these and other mechanisms, with a 
view to facilitating the acceptance of conformity assessment results; 
 
(b)  exchange information on the criteria used to select appropriate conformity 
assessment procedures for specific products and, in line with Article 5.1.2 of the TBT 
Agreement, require that conformity assessment procedures shall not be more strict or 
be applied more strictly than is necessary to give the importing Party adequate 
confidence that products conform with the applicable technical regulations or 
standards, taking account of the risks non-conformity would create; 
 
(c)  exchange information on accreditation policies and consider how to make the best use 
of international standards for accreditation and the best use of international 
agreements involving the Parties' accreditation bodies, for example through the 
mechanisms of the International Laboratory Accreditation Co-operation and the 
International Accreditation Forum; and 
 
(d)  ensure that, insofar as two or more conformity assessment bodies are authorised by a 
Party to carry out conformity assessment procedures required for placing the product 
on the market, economic operators may choose among them. 
 
EUSFTA Chapter 4 - 7 
 3.  The Parties reaffirm their obligation under Article 5.2.5 of the TBT Agreement that 
fees imposed for mandatory conformity assessment of imported products shall be equitable 
in relation to any fees chargeable for assessing the conformity of like products of national 
origin or originating in any other country, taking into account communication, 
transportation and other costs arising from differences between location of facilities of the 
applicant and the conformity assessment body. 
 
4.  Upon request by either Party, the Parties may decide to engage in consultations with 
a view to defining sectoral initiatives regarding the use of conformity assessment 
procedures or the facilitation of acceptance of conformity assessment results that are 
appropriate for the respective sectors. The Party making the request should substantiate it 
with relevant information on how this sectoral initiative would facilitate trade between the 
Parties. In these consultations, all mechanisms described in paragraph 1 may be considered. 
Where a Party declines such a request from the other Party, it shall, upon request, explain 
its reasons. 
 
 
ARTICLE 4.8 
 
Transparency 
 
The Parties reaffirm their transparency obligations under the TBT Agreement with regard to 
the preparation, adoption and application of standards, technical regulations and 
conformity assessment procedures, and agree: 
 
(a)  where a part of the process of developing a technical regulation is open to public 
consultation, to take the other Party's views into account and, without discrimination, 
to provide reasonable opportunities for the other Party and its interested persons to 
make comments; 
 
EUSFTA Chapter 4 - 8 
 (b)  when making notifications in accordance with Article 2.9 of the TBT Agreement, to 
allow at least 60 days following the notification for the other Party to provide 
comments in writing on the proposal and where practicable, to give appropriate 
consideration to reasonable requests for extending the comment period; 
 
(c)  to allow sufficient time between the publication of technical regulations and their 
entry into force for economic operators of the other Party to adapt, except where 
urgent problems of safety, health, environmental protection or national security arise 
or threaten to arise; and 
 
(d)  to make available to the other Party or its economic operators relevant information 
(for example through a public website, if available) on technical regulations, standards 
and conformity assessment procedures in force and, as appropriate and available, 
written guidance on compliance with its technical regulations, upon request and 
without undue delay. 
 
 
ARTICLE 4.9 
 
Market Surveillance 
 
The Parties undertake to exchange information on market surveillance and enforcement 
activities. 
 
 
EUSFTA Chapter 4 - 9 
 ARTICLE 4.10 
 
Marking and Labelling 
 
1.  The Parties note that, according to paragraph 1 of Annex 1 of the TBT Agreement, a 
technical regulation may include or deal exclusively with marking or labelling requirements, 
and they agree, where their technical regulations contain mandatory marking or labelling, to 
ensure that such regulations are not prepared with a view to, or with the effect of, creating 
unnecessary obstacles to international trade, and that such regulations are not more trade 
restrictive than necessary to fulfil a legitimate objective, as referred to under Article 2.2 of 
the TBT Agreement. 
 
2.  The Parties agree that where a Party requires the mandatory marking or labelling of 
products: 
 
(a)  that Party shall endeavour to restrict its requirements only to those which are relevant 
for consumers or users of the product or are relevant to indicate the product's 
conformity with the mandatory requirements; 
 
(b)  that Party may specify the information to be provided on the label, and may require 
compliance with certain regulatory requirements for the affixing of the label, but shall 
not require any prior approval or certification of labels and markings as a precondition 
for sale of the products on its market, unless this is deemed necessary in the light of 
the risk of the product to human, animal or plant health or life; 
 
EUSFTA Chapter 4 - 10 
 (c)  where that Party requires the use of a unique identification number by economic 
operators, that Party shall ensure that such numbers are issued to the relevant 
economic operators without undue delay and on a non-discriminatory basis; 
 
(d)  provided it is not misleading, contradictory or confusing in relation to the information 
required in the importing Party of the goods, that Party shall permit the following to 
be used in the marking or labelling of products: 
 
(i)  information in other languages in addition to the information in the language 
required by the importing Party of the goods; 
 
(ii)  internationally-accepted nomenclatures, pictograms, symbols or graphics; and 
 
(iii)  additional information to that required in the importing Party of the goods; 
 
(e)  that Party shall accept that labelling, including re-labelling and corrections to labelling, 
may take place, where relevant, in authorised premises (for example, in customs 
warehouses at the point of import) in the territory of the importing Party prior to the 
distribution and sale of the product, as an alternative to labelling in the place of origin, 
unless such labelling in the place of origin is required for reasons of public health or 
safety; and 
 
(f)  that Party shall endeavour, in cases where it considers that legitimate objectives 
under the TBT Agreement are not compromised thereby, to accept non-permanent or 
detachable labels, or marking or labelling in the accompanying documentation rather 
than physically attached to the product. 
 
EUSFTA Chapter 4 - 11 
 3.  Without prejudice to the Parties' rights and obligations under the WTO Agreement, 
paragraph 2 shall apply to agricultural products, industrial products, and processed 
agricultural food products, including beverages and spirits. 
 
 
ARTICLE 4.11 
 
Contact Points 
 
The functions of the contact points designated in accordance with Article 13.4 (Enquiries 
and Contact Points) shall include: 
 
(a)  monitoring the implementation and administration of this Chapter; 
 
(b)  promptly addressing any issue that the other Party raises related to the development, 
adoption, application or enforcement of standards, technical regulations or 
conformity assessment procedures; 
 
(c)  enhancing cooperation in the development and improvement of standards, technical 
regulations, and conformity assessment procedures;
