EUSFTA-IPA Annex 3 - 1  ANNEX 3   EXPROPRIATION AND INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS  For greater certainty, the revocation, limitation or creation of intellectual property rights, to the extent that the measure is consistent with the TRIPS Agreement and Chapter Ten (Intellectual Property) of EUSFTA, does not constitute expropriation. Moreover, a determination that the measure is inconsistent with the TRIPS Agreement and Chapter Ten (Intellectual Property) of EUSFTA does not establish that there has been an expropriation.   ________________
