For Modes 1 and 2 
AT, CY, ES, EL, LT, MT, SK: Full admission to the Bar, which is required for the practice of 
domestic (EU and Member State) law, is subject to a nationality condition.

Due to the gradual liberalisation process of Singapore's legal services market, Singapore cannot yet commit to further market access in this sector. The Parties will, 
with a view to granting further market access, review their commitments in legal services no later than two years after entry into force of this Agreement. The 
Parties may, by decision in the Committee on Trade in Services, Investment and Government Procurement established pursuant to Article 16.2 (Specialised 
Committees) amend either Party's schedules in this respect 
6 
This includes legal advisory services, legal representational services, legal arbitration and conciliation/mediation services, and legal documentation and certification 
services. The provision of legal services is only authorised in respect of public international law, Union law and the law of any jurisdiction where the service supplier 
or its personnel is qualified to practice as a lawyer, and, like the provision of other services, is subject to licensing requirements and procedures applicable in the 
Member States of the Union. For lawyers providing legal services in respect of public international law and foreign law, these licensing requirements and procedures 
may take, inter alia, the form of compliance with local codes of ethics, use of home title (unless recognition with the host title has been obtained), insurance 
requirements, simple registration with the host country Bar or a simplified admission to the host country Bar through an aptitude test and a legal or professional 
domicile in the host country. Legal services in respect of Union law shall be carried out in principle by or through a fully qualified lawyer admitted to the Bar in a 
Member State of the Union acting personally, and legal services in respect of the law of a Member State of the Union shall in principle be carried out by or through a 
fully qualified lawyer admitted to the Bar in that Member State acting personally. Full admission to the Bar in the relevant Member State of the Union might 
therefore be necessary for representation before courts and other competent authorities in the Union since it involves practice of Union and national procedural 
law. However, in some Member States, foreign lawyers not fully admitted to the Bar are allowed to represent a party in civil proceedings where that party is a 
national of or belonging to the State in which the lawyer is entitled to practice.
