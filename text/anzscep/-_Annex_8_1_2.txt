Annex 8.1.2: Schedule of Commitments of Singapore 
 
Cover Note 
 
Central Product Classification (“CPC”) 
 
1. 
With the exception of telecommunications services, archive services, other 
maritime auxiliary services and financial services, the classification of services sectors 
shall be based on the 1991 provisional Central Product Classification of the United 
Nations Statistical Office. The ordering shall reflect the services sectoral classification 
list as used in GATT document MTN.GNS/W/120 dated 10 July 1991. The use of “ ** 
” against individual CPC codes indicates that the specific commitment for that code 
shall not extend to the total range of services covered under that code.  
 
2. 
The definitions for telecommunications services, archive services, other 
maritime auxiliary services and financial services shall be as stated in the schedule of 
specific commitments for these services.  
 
 
Format for Scheduling 
 
The scheduling of specific commitments shall follow the guidelines stated in 
GATT 
documents 
MTN.GNS/W/164 
dated 
3 
September 
1993 
and 
MTN.GNS/W/164/Add.1 dated 30 November 1993. 
 
 
Scheduling of Measures Relating to both Market Access and National Treatment 
 
Measures inconsistent with both Articles 17 and 18 have been inscribed in the 
column relating to Article 17.  The inscription shall also be considered a qualification to 
Article 18.

will be licensed via a tender and/or auction process. 
2 Facilities-based operators are operators that intend to deploy any form of telecommunication networks, 
systems and facilities to offer telecommunication switching, transmission capacity and services to 
existing licensed telecommunication operators, businesses and consumers. 
3 The Info-Communications Development Authority of Singapore (iDA) will consider favourably 
applications by FBOs to be designated as PTLs if the FBO commits to substantial infrastructure 
investment and rollout to offer services to a significant proportion of the population within a reasonable 
time period. In return, a PTL’s network installation process and the maintenance and protection of their 
networks receive special consideration under the Telecommunications Act of 1999. 
4 These networks can have international, nationwide local or selected local coverage.
