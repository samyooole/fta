Section 3: Obligations 
 
3.1  Consistent with the objectives set out in Article 1.1 (Objectives) and the provisions of 
this Chapter, and reflecting the level of confidence that each Party has in the other Party's 
regulatory outcomes and conformity assessment systems, each Party shall implement the 
principles of mutual recognition, unilateral recognition or harmonisation that provide the 
most appropriate or cost-efficient approach to the removal or reduction of technical, sanitary 
and phytosanitary barriers (hereinafter referred to as "regulatory barriers") to the movement 
of goods between New Zealand and Singapore for products or assessments of manufacturers 
of products specified in this Annex.  
 
3.2  Each Party recognises that the conformity assessment bodies designated by the other 
Party in accordance with this Annex are competent to undertake the conformity assessment 
activities necessary to demonstrate compliance with its mandatory requirements. 
 
3.3  Each Party shall accept test reports that demonstrate compliance with their mandatory 
requirements issued by test facilities designated by the other Party’s designating authorities in 
accordance with Section 6. 
 
6-11 
  
3.6  Each Party shall accept the results of product surveillance activities undertaken in 
accordance with their mandatory requirements by certification bodies designated by the other 
Party’s  designating  authorities  in  accordance  with  Section  6.  Such  results  shall  include 
supporting  test  results  from  test  facilities  designated  by  the  other  Party’s  designating 
authorities in accordance with Section 6. 
 
3.7  Each Party shall accept certification to their mandatory requirements undertaken by 
the relevant certification bodies designated by the other Party’s designating authorities in 
accordance with Section 6. 
 
3.8  The Parties shall give consideration to increasing the degree of harmonisation or 
equivalence of their mandatory requirements, where appropriate and where consistent with 
good  regulatory  practice.  If  both  Parties  agree  that  the  mandatory  requirements  are 
harmonised  or  established  as  equivalent,  in  accordance  with  Article  6.9,  the  results  of 
conformity assessment that demonstrate compliance with the exporting Party’s mandatory 
requirements  shall  be  accepted  as  demonstrating  compliance  with  the  importing  Party’s 
mandatory requirements without the need for further conformity assessment by the importing 
Party to demonstrate compliance with its own mandatory requirements. 
 
 
Section 4: Exchange of Information 
 
  The Parties’ relevant regulatory authorities shall notify each other and the relevant 
designating authorities of any proposed changes to their relevant mandatory requirements. 
Except if considerations of health, safety and the environment warrant more urgent action, 
such notification shall take place at least 60 days before the entry into force of the changes. 
 
 
Section 5: Designating Authorities 
 
5.1  New Zealand’s designating authorities shall be: 
 
(a)  the International Accreditation New Zealand for test facilities; and 
 
(b)  the Joint Accreditation System of Australia and New Zealand for certification 
bodies.

such participation is appropriate, technically possible and within reasonable cost. 
 
 
Section 6: Designation Procedures and Stipulated Requirements 
 
6.1   Designating  authorities  shall  give  advance  notice  of  at  least  seven  days  of  any 
changes, including suspension, to their list of designated conformity assessment bodies. 
 
6.2  Designating authorities shall specify the scope of the conformity assessment activities 
for which a conformity assessment body has been designated. When a conformity assessment 
body is designated to undertake tests with regard to particular mandatory requirements, the 
relevant obligations of acceptance shall be limited to the results of assessments in relation to 
those mandatory requirements. 
 
6.3  Designating  authorities  shall  only  designate  conformity  assessment  bodies  if  the 
conformity assessment body, or the organisation of which the conformity assessment body is 
a part, is a legal person in the relevant jurisdiction. 
 
6.4  Designating authorities shall ensure that the conformity assessment bodies that they 
designate maintain the necessary technical competence to demonstrate the conformity of a 
product with the standards or specifications to meet mandatory requirements. Conformity 
assessment bodies of a non-Party shall be acceptable for designation by the Parties if there 
are no conformity assessment bodies designated in the territory of a Party and the other Party 
agrees to such designation.

designate participate in appropriate proficiency-testing programmes and other comparative 
reviews  such  as  non-government-to-government  mutual  recognition  agreements,  so  that 
confidence in their technical competence to undertake the required conformity assessment is 
maintained. 
 
6.7  Designated conformity assessment bodies shall not be adversely influenced by a body 
that manufactures or trades in electrical and electronic equipment. Furthermore, designated 
conformity  assessment  bodies  shall  be  impartial.  Any  other  services  offered  by  the 
conformity assessment body shall be provided in a manner that does not compromise the 
objectivity of its conformity assessment activities and decisions.

of technical competence to undertake conformity assessment activities that 
demonstrate conformity with the mandatory requirements for which they are 
to be designated provided that: 
 
(i)  the accreditation process is conducted in compliance with ISO/IEC 
Guide 58:1993; and 
 
(ii)  the accreditation body participates in mutual recognition arrangements, 
such  as  the  Asia  Pacific  Laboratory  Accreditation  Cooperation 
(APLAC) Mutual Recognition Arrangement, where they are subject to 
peer evaluation of the competence of accreditation bodies and the test 
facilities accredited by them; or 
 
(b)  membership in the IECEE CB Scheme. 
 
6.11  The basis for designating certification bodies shall be either: 
 
(a)   accreditation  to  ISO/IEC  Guide  65:1996,  which  shall  constitute  sufficient 
proof of technical competence to undertake conformity assessment activities

Section 7: Suspension and Withdrawal of Conformity Assessment Bodies 
 
7.1  Each Party shall have the right to challenge a designated conformity assessment 
body's technical competence and compliance with the relevant stipulated requirements. This 
right shall be exercised only in exceptional circumstances and where supported by relevant 
expert analysis or evidence. A Party shall exercise this right by notifying the other Party in 
writing. Such notification shall be accompanied by the supporting expert analysis or evidence. 
 
7.2  Except in urgent circumstances, the Parties shall, prior to a challenge under section 
7.1, enter into consultations with a view to seeking a mutually satisfactory solution. In urgent 
circumstances, consultations shall take place immediately after the right of challenge has 
been exercised.  
 
7.3  The consultations referred to in section 7.2 shall be conducted expeditiously with a 
view to resolving all issues and seeking a mutually satisfactory solution within 70 days. If 
this is not achieved, the matter shall be resolved in accordance with Chapter 14 (Dispute 
Settlement).  
 
6-15 
  
7.4  Unless the Parties decide otherwise, the designation of the challenged designated 
conformity assessment body shall be suspended by the relevant designating authority for the 
relevant  scope  of  designation  from  the  time  its  technical  competence  or  compliance  is 
challenged, until either:  
 
(a)  the challenging Party is satisfied as to the competence and compliance of the 
conformity assessment body; or  
 
(b)  the designation of that conformity assessment body has been withdrawn.  
 
7.5  The results of conformity assessment activities undertaken by a designated conformity 
assessment body on or before the date of its suspension or withdrawal shall remain valid for 
acceptance for the purposes of Section 3 unless otherwise agreed by the Parties.

8.1   Each  Party  retains  all  authority  under  its  laws  and  regulations  to  interpret  and 
implement its mandatory requirements.  
 
8.2  This Annex shall not limit the authority of a Party to determine the level of protection 
it considers necessary for the protection of inter alia human health or safety, animal or plant 
life or health, or the environment.  
 
8.3  This Annex shall not limit the authority of a Party to take all appropriate measures 
whenever it ascertains that products may not conform with its mandatory requirements. Such 
measures may include withdrawing the products from the market, prohibiting their placement 
on the market, restricting their free movement, initiating a product recall, initiating legal 
proceedings or otherwise preventing the recurrence of such problems, including through a 
prohibition on imports. If a Party takes such measures, it shall notify the other Party within 
15 days of taking the measures, giving its reasons.
