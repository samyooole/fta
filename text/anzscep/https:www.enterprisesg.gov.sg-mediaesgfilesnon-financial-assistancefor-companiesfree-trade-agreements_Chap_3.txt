Each Party shall provide that all costs considered for the calculation of regional value content are recorded and maintained in conformity with the Generally Accepted Accounting Principles applicable in the territory of a Party where the good is produced.   Article 3.6: Materials Used in Production  1. Each Party shall provide that if a non-originating material undergoes further production such that it satisfies the requirements of this Chapter, the material is treated as originating when determining the originating status of the subsequently produced good, regardless of whether that material was produced by the producer of the good.  2. Each Party shall provide that if a non-originating material is used in the production of a good, the following may be counted as originating content for the purposes of determining whether the good meets a regional value content requirement:  (a) the value of processing of the non-originating materials undertaken in the territory of one or both of the Parties; and  (b) the value of any originating material used in the production of the non-originating material undertaken in the territory of one or both of the Parties.    Article 3.7: Value of Materials Used in Production  Each Party shall provide that for the purposes of this Chapter, the value of a material is:  3-5  (a) for a material imported by the producer of the good, the transaction value of the material at the time of importation, including the costs incurred in the international shipment of the good;  (b) for a material acquired in the territory where the good is produced:  (i) the price paid or payable by the producer in the territory of the Party where the producer is located;   (ii) the value as determined for an imported material in subparagraph (a); or   (iii) the earliest ascertainable price paid or payable in the territory of the Party; or  (c) for a material that is self-produced:   (i) all the costs incurred in the production of the material, which includes general expenses; and   (ii) an amount equivalent to the profit added in the normal course of trade or equal to the profit that is usually reflected in the sale of goods of the same class or kind as the self-produced material that is being valued.    Article 3.8: Further Adjustments to the Value of Materials  1.  Each Party shall provide that for an originating material, the following expenses may be added to the value of the material, if not included under Article 3.7:  (a) the costs of freight, insurance, packing and all other costs incurred to transport the material to the location of the producer of the good;  (b) duties, taxes and customs brokerage fees on the material, paid in the territory of one or both of the Parties, other than duties and taxes that are waived, refunded, refundable or otherwise recoverable, which include credit against duty or tax paid or payable; and  (c) the cost of waste and spoilage resulting from the use of the material in the production of the good, less the value of reusable scrap or by-product.   2.  Each Party shall provide that, for a non-originating material or material of undetermined origin, the following expenses may be deducted from the value of the material:  (a) the costs of freight, insurance, packing and all other costs incurred in transporting the material within the territories of the Parties to the location of the producer of the good; 3-6   (b) duties, taxes and customs brokerage fees on the material paid in the territory of one or both of the Parties, other than duties and taxes that are waived, refunded, refundable or otherwise recoverable, which include credit against duty or tax paid or payable; and  (c) the cost of waste and spoilage resulting from the use of the material in the production of the good, less the value of reusable scrap or by-product.  3.

Each Party shall provide that production undertaken on a non-originating material in the territory of one or both of the Parties by one or more producers may contribute toward the originating content of a good for the purposes of determining its origin, regardless of whether that production was sufficient to confer originating status to the material itself.  3. Subject to paragraph 4, if each Party has a trade agreement that, as contemplated by the WTO Agreement, concerns the establishment of a free trade area with the same non-Party, the territory of that non-Party shall be deemed to form part of the territory of the free trade area established by this Agreement, for the purposes of determining whether a good is an originating good under this Agreement.  4. A Party shall apply paragraph 3 only once provisions with effect equivalent to those of paragraph 3 are in force between each Party and the non-Party with which each Party has separately concluded a free trade agreement. If such provisions in force between a Party and the non-Party apply to only certain goods or under certain conditions, the other Party may limit the application of paragraph 3 to those goods and under those conditions and as otherwise set out in this Agreement.   Article 3.10: De Minimis  1. Each Party shall provide that a good that contains non-originating materials that do not satisfy the applicable change in tariff classification requirement specified in Annex 3.1 for the good is nonetheless an originating good if:  3-7  (a) the value of all those materials does not exceed 10 per cent of the value of the good, as defined under Article 3.5, and the good meets all the other applicable requirements of this Chapter; or   (b) for a good classified in Chapters 50 through 63 of the Harmonized System, the total weight of all such materials does not exceed 10 per cent of the total weight of the good, or the total value of all such materials does not exceed 10 per cent of the value of the good.  2.  Paragraph 1 applies only when using a non-originating material in the production of another good.

Each Party shall provide that if a good is subject to a regional value content requirement, the value of the packaging materials and containers in which the good is packaged for retail sale, if classified with the good, are taken into account as originating or non-originating, as the case may be, in calculating the regional value content of the good.   Article 3.14: Packing Materials and Containers for Shipment   Each Party shall provide that packing materials and containers for shipment are disregarded in determining whether a good is originating.     Article 3.15: Indirect materials  1. Each Party shall provide that an indirect material is considered to be originating without regard to where it is produced.    2. Indirect material means a material used in the production, testing or inspection of a good but not physically incorporated into the good; or a material used in the maintenance of buildings or the operation of equipment, associated with the production of a good, including:  (a) fuel, energy, catalysts and solvents;  (b) equipment, devices and supplies used to test or inspect the good;  (c) gloves, glasses, footwear, clothing, safety equipment and supplies;  (d) tools, dies and moulds; 3-9   (e) spare parts and materials used in the maintenance of equipment and buildings;  (f) lubricants, greases, compounding materials and other materials used in production or used to operate equipment and buildings; and  (g) any other material that is not incorporated into the good but the use of which in the production of the good can reasonably be demonstrated to be a part of that production.   Article 3.16: Sets of Goods   Sets, as defined in General Interpretative Rule 3 of the Harmonized System, shall be regarded as originating when all component products are originating products. When a set is composed of originating and non-originating products, the set as a whole shall be regarded as originating, provided that the value of the originating products is not less than 40 percent of the value of the set.   Article 3.17: Transit and Transhipment  1. Each Party shall provide that an originating good retains its originating status if the good has been transported to the importing Party without passing through the territory of a non-Party.   2. Each Party shall provide that if an originating good is transported through the territory of one or more non-Parties, the good retains its originating status provided that the good does not undergo any operation outside the territories of the Parties other than: unloading; reloading; separation from a bulk shipment; storing; labelling or marking required by the importing Party; or any other operation necessary to preserve it in good condition or to transport the good to the territory of the importing Party.
