 Annex 11.1 - 1 Annex 11.1 Expropriation and Nationalization   The Parties confirm their shared understanding that:  1. Article 11.10.1 (Expropriation and Nationalization) is intended to reflect customary international law concerning the obligation of States with respect to expropriation.  2. An action or a series of actions by a Party cannot constitute an expropriation unless it interferes with a tangible or intangible property right or property interest in an investment.   3. Article 11.10.1 (Expropriation and Nationalization) addresses two situations. The first is direct expropriation, where an investment is nationalized or otherwise directly expropriated through formal transfer of title or outright seizure.  4. The second situation addressed by Article 11.10.1 (Expropriation and Nationalization) is indirect expropriation, where an action or series of actions by a Party has an effect equivalent to direct expropriation without formal transfer of title or outright seizure.  (a) The determination of whether an action or series of actions by a Party, in a specific fact situation, constitutes an indirect expropriation, requires a case-by-case, fact-based inquiry that considers, among other factors:  i. the economic impact of the government action, although the fact that an action or series of actions by a Party has an adverse effect on the economic value of an investment, standing alone, does not establish that an indirect expropriation has occurred;  ii. the extent to which the government action interferes with distinct, reasonable investment-backed expectations; and  iii. the character of the government action.  (b) Except in rare circumstances, non-discriminatory regulatory actions by a Party that are designed and applied to protect legitimate public welfare objectives, such as public health, safety and the environment, do not constitute indirect expropriations.
