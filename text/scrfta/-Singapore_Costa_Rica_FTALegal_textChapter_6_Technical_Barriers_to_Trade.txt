The Parties agree to ensure that technical regulations, standards and conformity assessment procedures do not constitute barriers to trade within the terms of the TBT Agreement.  3.  With a view to facilitating trade and increasing bilateral trade, the Parties shall seek to improve their cooperation and enhance mutual understanding of their respective systems.   Article 6.2: Scope and Coverage  1.  The Parties reaffirm their existing rights and obligations under the TBT Agreement.  2.  This Chapter is applicable to all standards, technical regulations and conformity assessment procedures, that may, directly or indirectly, affect trade in goods and/or assessments of manufacturers or manufacturing processes of goods traded between the Parties6 . 3.  This Chapter does not apply to sanitary and phytosanitary measures as defined in the SPS Agreement which are covered by Chapter 5 (Sanitary and Phytosanitary Measures) of this Agreement, or purchasing specifications prepared by governmental bodies for production or consumption requirements of governmental bodies which will be regulated by Chapter 8 (Government Procurement).    Article 6.3: Definitions  For purposes of this Chapter, standards, technical regulations and conformity assessment procedures shall have the meanings assigned to those terms in Annex 1 of the TBT Agreement.                                                   6 The application of this Chapter to all goods traded between the Parties is regardless of origin.   38 Article 6.4: Technical Regulations  1.  In consistency with Article 2.4 of the TBT Agreement, each Party shall use, to the maximum extent possible, relevant international standards as a basis for its technical regulations.   2.  Each Party shall give positive consideration to accept as equivalent, technical regulations of the other Party, even if these regulations differ from its own, provided that it is satisfied that these regulations adequately fulfill the objectives of its own regulations.   Article 6.5: Standards  1.  The Parties confirm their obligation, under Article 4.1 of the TBT Agreement, to ensure that their standardizing bodies accept and comply with the Code of Good Practice for the Preparation, Adoption and Application of Standards, established in Annex 3 of the TBT Agreement.  2. In determining whether an international standard, guide, or recommendation within the meaning of Articles 2, 5 and Annex 3 of the TBT Agreement exists, each Party shall apply the principles set out in Decisions and Recommendations adopted by the Committee since 1 January 1995, G/TBT/1/Rev. 9, 8 September 2008 (Decision of the Committee on Principles for the Development of International Standards, Guides and Recommendations with relation to Articles 2, 5 and Annex 3 of the TBT Agreement).   Article 6.6: Conformity Assessment Procedures  1.

Any information or explanation that is provided shall be given in print or electronically.    Article 6.10: Confidentiality  1.
