sufficient production in the territory of one or both Parties, as provided under 
this Article, shall be treated as originating goods of that Party.

it fulfills the product-specific rule as set out in Annex 3.1 
(Exceptions for the General Rule of Origin under Article 3.5); or 
 
(b)

content of not less than 35% determined in accordance with 
Article 3.6 (Qualifying Value Content). 
 
 
 
17 
Article 3.6: Qualifying Value Content 
 
1. 
For the purpose of paragraph 2 of Article 3.5 (Not Wholly Obtained or 
Produced Goods), the following formula for qualifying value content shall be 
applied: 
 
QVC = 
     FOB - VNM 
X 100 
     FOB 
 
Where: 
 
(a) 
“QVC” is the qualifying value content of the good, expressed as 
a percentage; 
 
(b) 
“FOB” is the Free On Board value of the particular good 
determined in accordance with the Customs Valuation 
Agreement; and 
 
(c) 
“VNM” is the value of non-originating materials used by the 
producer in the production of the good, calculated in accordance 
with paragraph 2 below. 
 
2. 
For the purpose of calculating the value of non-originating materials 
pursuant to subparagraph (c) above, the following formula shall be applied: 
 
VNM = TVM - QVM 
 
Where: 
 
(a) 
“TVM” is the total value of materials; and 
 
(b) 
“QVM” is the qualifying value of materials, which shall be 
calculated as: 
 
i. 
the total value of the material if the material satisfies the 
rule established in Article 3.2 (Originating Goods), and 
the material has undergone its last production or 
operation in the territory of either Party; or 
 
ii. 
the value of the material that can be attributed to one or 
both of the Parties if the material does not satisfy the rule 
established in Article 3.2 (Originating Goods). 
 
3. 
All costs considered for the calculation of qualifying value content shall 
be recorded and maintained in conformity with the Generally Accepted 
Accounting Principles applicable in the territory of the Party where the good is 
produced. 
 
 
 
18 
Article 3.7: Value of Materials

determined in accordance with the Customs Valuation 
Agreement, for a material imported directly by the producer of 
the good; 
 
(b) 
for a material acquired by the producer in the territory where the 
good is produced, the transaction value, or if this is not known 
and cannot be ascertained, the first ascertainable price paid for 
the material in the Party; or 
 
(c) 
for a material that is self-produced, or where the relationship 
between the producer of the good and the seller of the material 
influences the price actually paid or payable for the material, 
including a material obtained without charge, the sum of: 
 
i. 
all expenses incurred in the production of the material, 
including general expenses; and 
 
ii. 
an amount for profit equivalent to the profit added in the 
normal course of trade. 
 
 
Article 3.8: De Minimis 
 
Notwithstanding Article 3.5 (Not Wholly Obtained or Produced Goods), 
a good shall be considered to be originating if the value of all non-originating 
materials used in the production of that good, which do not satisfy the 
requirement of change in tariff classification as set out in Article 3.5 (Not 
Wholly Obtained or Produced Goods) is not more than 10% of the FOB value 
of the good. 
 
 
Article 3.9: Accumulation 
 
1. 
Originating goods or materials from the territory of one or both Parties, 
used in the production of a good in the territory of the other Party, shall be

Article 3.10: Accessories, Spare Parts, Tools 
 
1. 
Each Party shall provide that accessories, spare parts, or tools 
delivered with a good that form part of the good’s standard accessories, spare 
parts, or tools, shall be treated as originating goods if the good is an 
originating good, and shall be disregarded in determining whether all the non-
originating materials used in the production of the good undergo the 
applicable change in tariff classification, provided that: 
 
(a) 
the accessories, spare parts, or tools are not invoiced separately 
from the good; and 
 
(b) 
the quantities and value of the accessories, spare parts, or tools 
are customary for the good. 
 
2. 
If the good is subject to a qualifying value content requirement, the 
value of the accessories, spare parts, or tools shall be taken into account as 
originating or non-originating materials, as the case may be, in calculating the 
qualifying value content of the good. 
 
 
Article 3.11: Packaging Materials and Containers for Retail Sale 
 
Each Party shall provide that packaging materials and containers in 
which a good is packaged for retail sale, if classified with the good, shall be 
disregarded in determining whether all the non-originating materials used in 
the production of the good undergo the applicable change in tariff 
classification set out in Article 3.5 (Not Wholly Obtained or Produced Goods) 
and, if the good is subject to qualifying value content requirement, the value of 
such packaging materials and containers shall be taken into account as 
originating or non-originating materials, as the case may be, in calculating the 
qualifying value content of the good. 
 
 
Article 3.12: Packing Materials and Containers for Shipment 
 
Each Party shall provide that packing materials and containers in which 
a good is packed for shipment shall be disregarded in determining whether a 
good is originating. 
 
 
Article 3.13: Fungible Goods and Materials 
 
1. 
Each Party shall provide that the determination of whether fungible 
goods or materials are originating goods shall be made either by physical 
segregation of each good or material or through the use of any inventory 
management method, such as averaging, last-in first-out, or first-in first-out, 
recognized in the Generally Accepted Accounting Principles of the Party in 
which the production is performed or otherwise accepted by the Party in which 
the production is performed. 
 
 
20 
 
2. 
Each Party shall provide that an inventory management method 
selected under paragraph 1 for particular fungible goods or materials shall 
continue to be used for those fungible goods or materials throughout the fiscal 
year of the person that selected the inventory management method. 
 
 
Article 3.14: Indirect Materials Used in Production 
 
Each Party shall provide that an indirect material shall be treated as 
originating without regard to where it is produced and its value shall be the 
cost registered in the accounting records of the producer of the good.

1. 
Preferential tariff treatment provided for in this Agreement shall be 
applied to goods that satisfy the requirements of this Chapter and which are 
directly transported among the Parties.

Notwithstanding paragraph 1, goods that transit through non-Party 
countries, with or without transhipment or temporary storage, shall be eligible 
for preferential treatment when proved to the satisfaction of the importing

(d) 
the goods remain under the control of customs authorities4
 
 in 
the territory of a non-Party.
