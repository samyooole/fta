The Honourable Marco Vinicio Ruiz 
Minister of Foreign Trade 
San Jose, Costa Rica 
 
 
Dear Minister Ruiz: 
 
In connection with the Free Trade Agreement between our Governments, 
signed at Singapore on 6 April 2010, and considering that the national language 
of Singapore is the Malay language, and the official language of Costa Rica is 
the Spanish language, I have the honour to propose that: 
 
In view that the English and Spanish texts of the Agreement are 
equally authentic, in the event of any divergence between these 
texts, the English text shall prevail. 
 
I have the further honour to propose that this letter and your letter of acceptance 
in reply shall constitute an agreement between our Governments of the matter 
stated herein. 
 
 
Sincerely, 
 
 
 
 
 
S Iswaran
