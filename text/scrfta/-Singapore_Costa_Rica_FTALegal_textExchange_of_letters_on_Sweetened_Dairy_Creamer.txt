The Honorable S Iswaran 
Senior Minister of State 
for Trade and Industry and Education  
Singapore 
 
 
Dear Mr Iswaran: 
 
In connection with the Free Trade Agreement between our Governments, 
signed at Singapore on April 6, 2010, and for greater certainty, with respect to 
the preferential treatment granted by Costa Rica to “sweetened dairy creamer” 
from Singapore, I have the honor to propose that: 
 
“sweetened dairy creamer” constituted by 40%-50% of sugar, 
25%-35% of water, 10%-15% of milk, 10%-15% of vegetable oil, 
and 0%-1% of food additives, shall be classified by Costa Rica 
under 
Harmonized 
System 
(HS) 
code 
2106.90.99.90.  
Consequently, such good shall be imported under this HS code in 
order to receive preferential treatment under the Free Trade 
Agreement. 
 
I have the further honor to propose that this letter and your letter of acceptance 
in reply shall constitute an agreement between our Governments of the matter 
stated herein. 
 
 
Sincerely, 
 
 
 
 
 
Marco Vinicio Ruiz 
Minister
