supply of a service in its territory, a reservation for that measure taken with 
respect to Article 10.3 (National Treatment), 10.4 (Most-Favoured-Nation 
Treatment), or 10.6 (Local Presence) shall operate as a reservation with respect

11.8 (Performance Requirements) to the extent of that measure.
