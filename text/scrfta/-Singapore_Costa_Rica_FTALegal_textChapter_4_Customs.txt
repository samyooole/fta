The Parties agree that the Certification of Origin does not need to be in a prescribed format and the data elements for this Certification of Origin are those stated in Annex 4.1 (Data Elements to be Included in the Certification of Origin).

Article 4.14: Record Keeping Requirement  1. Each Party shall provide that an exporter or producer in its territory that completes and signs a Certification of Origin shall maintain in its territory, for 3 years after the date on which the Certification of Origin was issued or signed, all records relating to the origin of a good for which preferential tariff treatment was claimed in the territory of the other Party, including records associated with:  (a) the purchase of, cost of, value of, shipping of, and payment for, the good that is exported from its territory;  (b) the sourcing of, purchase of, cost of, value of, and payment for, all materials, including indirect materials, used in the production of the good that is exported from its territory; and  (c) the production of the good in the form in which the good is exported from its territory.  2.

The records to be maintained may include electronic records and shall be maintained in accordance with the domestic laws and practices of each Party.    27 Article 4.15: Verification of Origin  1. For purposes of determining whether a good imported into its territory from the territory of the other Party qualifies as an originating good, the importing Party may conduct verification by means of:  (a) requests for information from the importer;  (b) written questionnaires or requests for information to the exporter or producer of the good(s) in the territory of the other Party, through the competent government authority of the exporting Party, who shall notify the exporter or producer within 5 days upon receipt of such requests;   (c) requests for assistance from the competent government authority of the exporting Party as provided for in paragraph 3 below; or  (d) verification visits to the premises of an exporter or a producer in the territory of the other Party, to observe the facilities and the production processes of the good and to review the records referring to origin including accounting files.  2. For purposes of subparagraphs 1(a) and 1(b), the importer, exporter or producer:  (a) shall answer and return the request within a period of 30 days from the date on which it was received;   (b) may have one opportunity, before the expiration of the period established in subparagraph (a), to make a written request to the competent government authority of the importing Party for an extension of the answering period, for a period not exceeding 30 days.  For the exporter or producer, this written request will be made through the competent government authority of the exporting Party.  In the case where the importer, exporter, or producer does not return the written request for the information made by the competent government authority of the importing Party within the given period or its extension, the importing Party may deny preferential treatment to the good that is subject to verification.  3. For purposes of subparagraph 1(c), the customs authority of the importing Party:  (a) may request the assistance of the competent government authority of the exporting Party in verifying:    28 i. whether the goods declared in the Certification of Origin qualify as originating goods; and/or  ii. the accuracy of any information contained in the Certification of Origin;  (b) shall provide the competent government authority of the other Party with:  i. the reasons why such assistance is sought;  ii. the Certification of Origin, or a copy thereof; and  iii. any information and documents as may be necessary for the purpose of providing such assistance.  4. To the extent allowed by its domestic law and practices, the competent government authority of the exporting Party shall fully cooperate in any action to verify the origin as established under subparagraph 1(b) and paragraph 3 above.  In the absence of such cooperation, the importing Party shall determine the accuracy of the information contained in the Certification of Origin with the best information available at that moment.  5. For purposes of subparagraph 1(d), the competent government authority of the importing Party shall:  (a) deliver, at least 30 days prior to conducting a verification visit, a written notification of its intention to conduct the visit to the exporter or producer and to the competent government authority of the exporting Party; and   (b) obtain the written consent of the exporter or producer.  6. Pursuant to paragraph 5, the exporter or producer may within 15 days of receiving the notification, request to the competent government authority of the importing Party for a postponement of the proposed verification visit, for a period not exceeding 60 days.  This extension shall be notified to the competent authorities of the importing and exporting Parties.  7. A Party shall not deny preferential tariff treatment to a good solely because a verification visit was postponed pursuant to paragraph 6.  8. In the case where an exporter or producer does not give its written consent to a proposed verification visit within 30 days from the receipt of notification, the importing Party may deny preferential treatment to the good that is subject to verification.   9. After concluding the actions related to subparagraphs 1(a), (b), (c) or (d), and no later than 15 days after the outcome of the actions taken, the competent government authority of the importing Party shall provide a written   29 determination of whether the good is originating and therefore eligible for preferential tariff treatment based on the relevant law and findings of fact.  In respect of subparagraphs 1(a), (b), (c) or (d), the maximum time to be taken from the start of the verification to its conclusion should preferably not exceed 150 days.  10. When the customs authority, at time of importation of the goods in the customs territory of one of the Parties, is certain or has a reasonable doubt that the goods do not comply with the provisions under Chapter 3 (Rules of Origin) or the requirements under Annex 4.1 (Data Elements to be Included in the Certification of Origin), it can deny the preferential tariff treatment for such goods, upon notification to the importer by the established means.  In such case, the importer can apply the actions and time frames provided by the domestic laws, including customs clearance upon security.  Once the customs authority is satisfied that the goods comply with the provisions under Chapter 3 (Rules of Origin) or the requirements under Annex 4.1 (Data Elements to be Included in the Certification of Origin), the security or duties paid shall be refunded.  11. The importing Party may deny preferential treatment to an importer on any subsequent import of a good when its competent government authority had already determined that an identical good was not eligible for that treatment, provided that such good is exported by the same exporter or produced by the same producer subject to verification, until the importing Party determines that the importer, exporter, or producer is in compliance with this Chapter.   Article 4.16: Obligations Relating to Importations  1. Any good that meets all the applicable requirements in this Chapter and in Chapter 3 (Rules of Origin) is eligible for preferential tariff treatment.  2. A Party may deny preferential tariff treatment under this Agreement to imported good(s) if the importer fails to comply with any requirement of this Chapter or Chapter 3 (Rules of Origin).  3. Except as otherwise provided in this Chapter, each Party shall require an importer in its territory that claims preferential tariff treatment for a good imported into its territory from the territory of the other Party to:    (a) declare in the importation document that the good qualifies as an originating good, based on a Certification of Origin;   (b) have the Certification of Origin in its possession at the time the declaration is made;   (c) provide, on the request of that Party’s customs authority, a copy of the Certification of Origin; and     30 (d) promptly submit a corrected declaration in a manner required by the customs authority of the importing Party and pay any owed duties where the importer has reason to believe that a Certification of Origin on which a declaration was based contains information that is not correct.  4. Each Party shall provide that, where a good qualified as originating when it was imported into the territory of that Party but no claim for preferential tariff treatment was made at that time, the importer of the good may, no later than 1 year after the date on which the good was imported, apply for a refund of any excess duties paid as the result of the good not having been granted preferential tariff treatment, on presentation of:   (a) a written declaration that the good qualified as originating at the time of importation; and  (b) a copy of the Certification of Origin.    Article 4.17: Obligations Relating to Exportations   1. Each Party shall provide that an exporter or a producer in its territory shall submit a copy of the Certification of Origin to its competent government authority upon request.   2. When an exporter or a producer in its territory has provided a Certification of Origin and has reason to believe that such Certification contains or is based on incorrect information, the exporter or producer shall promptly notify in writing every person to whom it has provided the Certification of any change that could affect the accuracy or validity of the Certification, provided that such notification is made before the initiation of audit procedures.  Any penalty, if applicable, for providing an incorrect Certification of Origin for preferential tariff treatment shall be subject to Article 4.8 (Penalties).    Article 4.18: Third Party Invoicing    The importing Party shall accept a Certification of Origin in cases where the sales invoice is issued either by a company located in a non-Party or by an exporter in the exporting Party for the account of such company, provided that the good meets the requirements of Chapter 3 (Rules of Origin).
