Except as otherwise specified in the Annexes, this Chapter does not cover non-contractual agreements or any form of governmental assistance, including co-operative agreements, grants, loans, equity infusions, guarantees, fiscal incentives, and governmental provision of products and services to persons or governmental authorities not specifically covered under the schedules to this Chapter.  4.

To that end, these Articles, Notes and Appendices of the GPA are incorporated into and made part of this Chapter, mutatis mutandis.   2.

ARTICLE 16.4 : QUALIFICATION OF SUPPLIERS   Any conditions for participation in tendering procedures shall be limited to those which are essential to ensure the firm's capability to fulfill the contract in question. Any conditions for participation required from suppliers or service providers, including financial guarantees, technical qualifications and information necessary for establishing the financial, commercial and technical capacity of suppliers and service providers, as well as the verification of qualifications, shall be no less favourable to suppliers and service providers of the other Party than to domestic suppliers and service providers. The financial, commercial and technical capacity of a supplier or service provider shall be judged on the basis both of that supplier's or service provider's global business activity as well as of its activity in the territory of the procuring entity, taking due account of the legal relationship between the supply organisations.   ARTICLE 16.5 : INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY AND CO-OPERATION  1.  The Parties shall, to the extent possible, endeavour to use electronic means of communication to permit efficient dissemination of information on government procurement, particularly as regards tender opportunities offered by entities, while respecting the principles of transparency and non-discrimination.    2. When each Party publishes a notice inviting interested suppliers to submit tenders for the contract in accordance with Article IX of the GPA, which is incorporated into this Chapter by paragraph 1 of Article 16.3, it will use a single point of access specified in Annex 16B.  3. The Parties shall endeavour to provide each other with technical co-operation and assistance through the exchange of information on the development of their respective government electronic procurement systems.    4. Pursuant to Article IX:8 of the GPA, the procuring entity shall publish a summary notice in one of the official languages of the WTO, namely English, French and Spanish. For the purposes of this Chapter, the Parties shall endeavour to use English as the language for publishing the notice for each case of intended procurement. The notice shall contain at least the following information:  (a) the subject matter of the contract; (b) the time limits set for the submission of tenders or an application to be invited to tender; and (c) the addresses and contacts from which documents relating to the contracts may be requested.

Such amendments, rectifications or modifications shall become effective thirty (30) days from the date of notification. The other Party shall not be entitled to compensatory adjustments.   2. Where a Party proposes to make a modification to its Appendices to Annex 16A when the business or commercial operations or functions of any of its entities or part thereof is constituted or established as an enterprise with a legal entity separate and distinct from the government of a Party, regardless of whether or not the government holds any shares or interest in such a legal entity, it shall notify the other Party. The proposed removal of such entity or modification shall become effective thirty (30) days from the date of notification. The other Party shall not be entitled to compensatory adjustments.  3. Where a Party proposes to make a modification for reasons other than those stated in paragraphs 1 and 2, it shall notify the other Party and provide appropriate compensatory adjustments in order to maintain a level of coverage comparable to that existing prior to the modification. The proposed modification shall become effective thirty (30) days from the date of notification.
