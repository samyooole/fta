ARTICLE 11.4 : CONDUCT OF MAJOR SUPPLIERS 
 
Treatment by Major Suppliers 
 
1. 
Each Party shall ensure that any major supplier in its territory accords facilities-
based suppliers, licensed in its territory, of the other Party treatment no less favourable 
than such major supplier accords to itself, its subsidiaries, its affiliates, or any non-
affiliated service supplier, provided they are facilities-based suppliers, regarding: 
 
(a) 
the 
availability, 
provisioning, 
rates, 
or 
quality 
of 
like 
public 
telecommunications transport network or services; and  
(b) 
the availability of technical interfaces necessary for interconnection. 
 
When necessary, a Party shall assess such treatment on the basis of whether such 
suppliers of public telecommunications transport network or services, subsidiaries, 
affiliates, and non-affiliated service suppliers are in like circumstances. 
 
Competitive Safeguards 
 
2. 
(a) 
Each Party shall maintain appropriate measures for the purpose of 
preventing suppliers of public telecommunications transport network or

information about essential facilities and commercially relevant 
information 
that 
is necessary 
for 
them 
to 
provide public 
telecommunications transport network or services; and

network or services at any technically feasible point, on an unbundled basis, 
in a timely fashion; and on terms, conditions, and cost-oriented rates that are 
reasonable, transparent, and non-discriminatory. 
 
(b) 
Each Party may determine, in accordance with its domestic laws and 
regulations, which network elements it requires major suppliers in its 
territory to provide access to in accordance with paragraph (a) on the basis 
of the technical feasibility of unbundling and the state of competition in the 
relevant market.

4. 
(a) 
Each Party shall ensure that major suppliers in its territory provide to 
facilities-based suppliers, licensed in its territory, of the other Party physical

unbundled network elements in a timely fashion and on terms, conditions, 
and cost-oriented rates that are reasonable, transparent, and non-
discriminatory. 
 
(b) 
Where physical co-location under paragraph (a) is not practical for technical 
reasons or because of space limitations, each Party shall ensure that major

which are owned or controlled by such major suppliers to facilities-based 
suppliers, licensed in its territory, of the other Party: 
 
(i)  in a timely fashion; and 
 
(ii)  on terms, conditions, and cost-oriented rates that are reasonable, 
transparent, and non-discriminatory. 
  
(b)  Each Party may determine, in accordance with its domestic laws and 
regulations, the poles, ducts, conduits or other structures to which it requires 
major suppliers in its territory to provide access under paragraph (a) on the 
basis of the state of competition in the relevant market.

subsidiaries or other affiliates; 
 
(ii)  in a timely fashion, on terms, conditions (including technical standards 
and specifications) and cost-oriented rates that are transparent,
