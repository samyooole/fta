In the sectors inscribed in its Schedule in Annex 12A, and subject to any conditions and qualifications set out therein, each Party shall accord to financial services and financial service suppliers of the other Party, in like circumstance, in respect of all measures affecting the supply of financial services, treatment no less favourable than that it accords to its own like financial services and financial service suppliers.    2.

Formally identical or formally different treatment shall be considered to be less favourable if it modifies the conditions of competition in favour of financial services and financial service suppliers of a Party, investors of a Party, financial institutions of a Party and to investments of investors of a Party in financial institutions compared to like financial services or financial service suppliers of the other Party, like investors of the other Party, like financial institutions of the other Party and investments of like investors of the other Party in financial institutions in like circumstance.

Where publication as referred to paragraph 2 is not practicable, such information shall be made otherwise publicly available.    4. Each Party shall respond promptly to all requests by the other Party for specific information of its regulatory measures of general application or international agreements within the meaning of paragraph 2.  Each Party shall also establish one or more enquiry points to provide specific information to the other Party, upon request, on all such matters.   ARTICLE 12.6 : EXCEPTIONS  1. Nothing in this Agreement shall be construed to prevent a Party from adopting or maintaining measures for prudential reasons, including for the protection of investors, depositors, policy holders or persons to whom a fiduciary duty is owed by a financial service supplier, or to ensure the integrity and stability of a Party’s financial system.  Where such measures do not conform with the provisions of this Agreement, they shall not be used as a means of avoiding the Party’s commitments or obligations under such provisions.  2. Nothing in this Chapter or Chapters  10 (Investment), 11 (Telecommunications), or 14 (Electronic Commerce) applies to non-discriminatory measures of general application taken by any public entity in pursuit of monetary and related credit policies or exchange rate policies. This paragraph shall not affect a Party’s obligations under  Article 9.15, 10.7 or 10.11.  3. Notwithstanding Articles 9.15 and 10.11, as incorporated into this Chapter, a Party may prevent or limit transfers by a financial institution or financial service supplier to, or for the benefit of, an affiliate of or a person related to such institution or supplier, through the equitable, non-discriminatory and good faith application of measures relating to maintenance of the safety, soundness, integrity or financial responsibility of financial institutions or financial service suppliers. This paragraph does not prejudice any other provision of this Agreement that permits a Party to restrict transfers.  4.   For greater certainty, nothing in this Chapter shall be construed to prevent the adoption or enforcement by a Party of measures necessary to secure compliance with laws or regulations that are not inconsistent with this Chapter including those relating to the prevention of deceptive and fraudulent practices or to deal with the effects of a default on financial services contracts, subject to the requirement that such measures are not applied in a manner which would constitute a means of arbitrary or unjustifiable discrimination between countries where like conditions prevail, or a disguised restriction on investment in financial institutions or cross-border trade in financial services.                 ARTICLE 12.7 : DOMESTIC REGULATION   In sectors where specific commitments are undertaken in its schedule to Annex 12A each Party shall ensure that all measures of general application to which this Chapter applies are administered in a reasonable, objective and impartial manner.   ARTICLE 12.8 :  TREATMENT OF CERTAIN INFORMATION  Nothing in this Chapter shall require a Party to furnish confidential information, the disclosure of which would impede law enforcement or otherwise be contrary to the public interest, or which would prejudice legitimate commercial interests of particular enterprises, public or private.   ARTICLE 12.9 : RECOGNITION   1. A Party may recognise the prudential measures of any international regulatory body or non-Party in determining how the Party’s measures relating to financial services shall be applied. Such recognition, which may be achieved through harmonisation or otherwise, may be based upon an agreement or arrangement with the international regulatory body or non-Party concerned or may be accorded autonomously.  2. A Party that is a party to such an agreement or arrangement referred to in paragraph 1, whether future or existing, shall afford adequate opportunity for the other Party to negotiate its accession to such agreements or arrangements, or to negotiate comparable ones with it, under circumstances in which there would be equivalent regulation, oversight, implementation of such regulation, and if appropriate, procedures concerning the sharing of information between the parties to the agreement or arrangement. Where a Party accords recognition autonomously, it shall afford adequate opportunity for the other Party to demonstrate that such circumstances exist.

Where an investor of a Party submits a claim under Section C in Chapter 10 (Investment) against the other Party and the respondent invokes Article 10.12 or 12.6, on request of the respondent, the tribunal shall refer the matter in writing to the Financial Services Committee for a decision. The tribunal may not proceed pending receipt of a decision or report under this Article.  2.
