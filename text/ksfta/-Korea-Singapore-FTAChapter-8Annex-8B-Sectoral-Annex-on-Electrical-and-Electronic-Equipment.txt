referred to in paragraph 1 of Section 1 of this Sectoral Annex . The applicable laws,
regulations and administrative provisions are set out in Table II .
3. This Sectoral Annex does not require mutual acceptance of the mandatory
requirements of each Party, or mutual recognition of the equivalence of such
mandatory requirements. The Parties shall, however, give consideration to increasing
the degree of harmonisation or equivalence of their respective mandatory requirements,
where appropriate and where consistent with good regulatory practice. Where both
Parties agree that the standards or technical regulations are harmonised or established
i) "New" excludes used and second-hand equipment regardless of whether they have been
refurbished or reconditioned.

c. certification by designated certification bodies.
6. For the purpose of this Sectoral Annex "low voltage" has the same meaning as
that defined in Band II of International Electrotechnical Commission Standards
60449:1979 - Voltage bands for electrical installations in building (IEC 60449 :1979),
and/or a voltage rating of between 50 and 1000V for alternating current, and between
75 and 1500V for direct current.
Section 2 Obligations

with Section 5 of this Sectoral Annex. Such certification shall be supplemented by
test results from test facilities designated by Singapore and registered by Korea. Upon
- 2 -receipt of such assessments, Korea shall complete the relevant certification registration
processes within four (4) calendar days or two (2) working days, whichever is the
longer.
2. Singapore shall accept certification of the results of conformity assessment
procedures (including results of factory/product surveillance activities and test results)
