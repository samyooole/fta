REFERENCE PAPER 
 
Scope 
 
 
The following are definitions and principles on the regulatory framework for the 
basic telecommunications services.   
 
Definitions 
 
 
Users mean service consumers and service suppliers.   
 
 
Essential facilities mean facilities of a public telecommunications transport 
network or service that 
 
(a) 
are exclusively or predominantly provided by a single or limited number 
of suppliers;  and 
(b) 
cannot feasibly be economically or technically substituted in order to 
provide a service. 
 
 
A major supplier is a supplier, which has the ability to materially affect the terms 
of participation (having regard to price and supply) in the relevant market for basic 
telecommunications services as a result of: 
 
(a) 
control over essential facilities;  or 
 
(b) 
use of its position in the market. 
 
1. 
Competitive safeguards 
 
1.1 
Prevention of anti-competitive practices in telecommunications 
 
 
Appropriate measures shall be maintained for the purpose of preventing suppliers 
who, alone or together, are a major supplier from engaging in or continuing anti-
competitive practices. 
 
1.2 
Safeguards 
 
 
The anti-competitive practices referred to above shall include in particular: 
 
(a) 
engaging in anti-competitive cross-subsidization;   
(b) 
using information obtained from competitors with anti-competitive results;  
and 
(c) 
not making available to other services suppliers on a timely basis technical 
information about essential facilities and commercially relevant 
information which are necessary for them to provide services.  
 
2. 
Interconnection 
 
2.1 
This 
section 
applies 
to 
linking 
with 
suppliers 
providing 
public 
telecommunications transport networks or services in order to allow the users of one 
supplier to communicate with users of another supplier and to access services provided 
by another supplier, where specific commitments are undertaken. 
 
2.2 
Interconnection to be ensured 
 
 
Interconnection with a major supplier will be ensured at any technically feasible 
point in the network.  Such interconnection is provided. 
 
(a) 
under non-discriminatory terms, conditions (including technical 
standards and specifications) and rates and of a quality no less 
favourable than that provided for its own like services or for like 
services of non-affiliated service suppliers or for its subsidiaries or 
other affiliates; 
(b) 
in a timely fashion, on terms, conditions (including technical standards 
and specifications) and cost-oriented rates that are transparent, 
reasonable, having regard to economic feasibility, and sufficiently 
unbundled so that the supplier need not pay for network components or 
facilities that it does not require for the service to be provided;  and 
(c) 
upon request, at points in addition to the network termination points 
offered to the majority of users, subject to charges that reflect the cost 
of construction of necessary additional facilities. 
 
2.3 
Public availability of the procedures for interconnection negotiations 
 
 
The procedures applicable for interconnection to a major supplier will be made 
publicly available. 
 
2.4 
Transparency of interconnection arrangements 
 
 
It is ensured that a major supplier will make publicly available either its 
interconnection agreements or a reference interconnection offer. 
 
2.5 
Interconnection:  dispute settlement

been established previously.
