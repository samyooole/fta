CHAPTER 2 
TRADE IN GOODS 
 
 
Article 2.1 
National Treatment 
 
Each Party shall accord national treatment to the goods of the other Party in accordance 
with Article III of the GATT 1994. To this end, the provisions of Article III of the GATT 
1994 are incorporated into and shall form part of this Agreement. 
 
 
Article 2.2 
Elimination of Duties 
 
1.  
Each Party shall eliminate its customs duties and charges having equivalent effect 
on originating goods of the other Party in accordance with Annex 2A.  
 
2.  
Neither Party shall increase an existing customs duty and charges having 
equivalent effect or introduce any such new duties on imports of originating goods 
of the other Party. 
 
3. 
Upon request by any Party, the Parties shall consult each other to consider the 
possibility of accelerating the elimination of customs duties and charges having 
equivalent effect as set out in Annex 2A.  An agreement by the Parties to accelerate 
the elimination of customs duties and charges having equivalent effect on a good, 
when approved by each Party in accordance with its applicable legal procedures, 
shall supersede the terms established for the good in this Article and Annex 2A. 
 
4.  
Nothing in this Chapter shall prevent a Party from imposing at any time on the 
importation or exportation of any good of the other Party: 
 
(a)  
a charge equivalent to an internal tax, such as excise duties and other taxes, 
levied at the time of importation or exportation, imposed consistently with 
Article 2.1; or 
 
(b)  
fees or other charges  such as charges levied for a specific service such as 
demurrage, warehousing, transport, loading and unloading charges that: 
 
 
(i)  
are limited in amount to the approximate cost of services rendered; 
and  
 
(ii)  
do not represent a direct or indirect protection for domestic goods or 
a taxation of imports for fiscal purposes.

Article 2.3 
Customs Value 
 
The Parties shall determine the customs value of goods traded between them in accordance 
with the provisions of Article VII of the GATT 1994 and the WTO Agreement on 
Implementation of Article VII of the GATT 1994. 
 
 
Article 2.4 
Transparency 
 
1. 
Each Party shall ensure that its laws, regulations and administrative rulings of 
general application respecting any matter covered by this Chapter are promptly 
published or otherwise made available in such a manner so as to enable interested 
persons and Parties to become acquainted with them. 
 
2. 
Each Party shall, upon request by the other Party, promptly respond to specific 
questions from, and provide information to, the other Party with respect to matters 
referred to in Article 2.4.1. 
 
 
Article 2.5 
Non-Tariff Measures 
 
1. 
Neither Party shall adopt or maintain any non-tariff measures on the importation of 
any good of the other Party or on the exportation of any good destined for the 
territory of the other Party except in accordance with its WTO rights and 
obligations.  
 
2. 
Each Party shall ensure the transparency of its non-tariff measures permitted under 
Article 2.5.1 and that they are not applied with a view to or with the effect of 
creating unnecessary obstacles to trade between the Parties. 
 
 
Article 2.6 
Subsidies and Countervailing Measures 
 
The rights and obligations of the Parties in respect of subsidies shall be governed by 
Articles VI and XVI of the GATT 1994, the WTO Agreement on Subsidies and 
Countervailing Measures and the WTO Agreement on Agriculture.

Article 2.7 
Safeguard Measures 
 
Imposition of Bilateral Safeguard Measures 
 
1. 
If as a result of the reduction or elimination of a customs duty1 under this 
Agreement, an originating good of a Party (“the first Party”) is being imported into 
the territory of the other Party (“the second Party”) in such increased quantities, in 
absolute terms, or relative to domestic production, and under such conditions that 
the imports of such good from the first Party alone constitute a substantial cause of 
serious injury to the domestic industry of the second Party producing a like or 
directly competitive good, the second Party may, in accordance with this Article: 
 
(a) 
suspend the further reduction of any rate of duty provided for under this 
Agreement for such good; or 
 
(b) 
increase the rate of duty on such good to a level not to exceed the lesser of  
 
(i) 
the most-favoured nation (hereafter, “MFN”) applied rate of duty in 
effect at the time the measure is taken; and 
 
(ii) 
                                                
the MFN applied rate of duty in effect on the day immediately 
proceeding the date of entry into force of this Agreement; or 
 
(c) 
in the case of a duty applied to a good on a seasonal basis, increase the rate 
of duty to a level not to exceed the lesser of the MFN applied rate of duty 
that was in effect on the good for the immediately preceding corresponding 
season or the date of entry into force of this Agreement. 
 
Conditions and Limitations on the Imposition of Bilateral Safeguard Measures 
 
2. 
The following conditions and limitations shall apply to an investigation or a 
bilateral safeguard measure under this Article:  
 
 
 
 
 
1 A determination that an originating good is being imported as a result of the reduction or elimination of a 
duty provided for in this Agreement shall be made only if such reduction or elimination is a cause which 
contributes significantly to the increase in imports, but need not be equal to or greater than any other cause. 
The passage of a period of time between the commencement and termination of such reduction or elimination 
and the increase in imports shall not by itself preclude the determination referred in this footnote.  If the 
increase in imports is demonstrably unrelated to such reduction or elimination, the determination referred in 
this footnote shall not be made.  
 
 6
(a) 
A Party shall immediately deliver written notice to the other Party upon: 
 
(i) 
initiating an investigation described in Article 2.7.2(d) relating to 
serious injury; such notice shall state the reasons for initiating such 
investigation; 
 
(ii) 
making a finding of serious injury caused by increased imports 
pursuant to the investigation described in Article 2.7.2(d); and 
 
(iii) 
taking a decision to apply a safeguard measure under this Article; 
 
(b) 
In making the notification referred to in Article 2.7.2(a), the Party 
proposing to apply a safeguard measure shall provide the other Party with 
all pertinent information, which shall include where available, evidence of 
serious injury caused by the increased imports, a precise description of the 
good involved and the proposed measure, the proposed date of introduction 
and the expected duration of the measure.  The Party proposing to apply a 
measure is also obliged to provide, subject to Article 8.3, any additional 
information which the other Party considers necessary; 
 
(c) 
A Party proposing to apply a measure shall provide adequate opportunity 
for prior consultations with the other Party as far in advance of taking any 
such measure as practicable, with a view to reviewing the information 
arising from the investigation conducted pursuant to Article 2.7.2(d), 
exchanging views on the measure and reaching an agreement on 
compensation under Article 2.7.4.  The Parties shall in such consultations, 
review, inter alia, the information provided under Article 2.7.2(b) to 
examine: 
 
(i) 
compliance with this Article; 
 
(ii) 
whether any proposed measure should be taken; and 
 
(iii) 
whether any proposed measure would operate such as to constitute 
an unnecessary obstacle to trade between the Parties; 
 
(d) 
A Party shall apply or take the measure only following an investigation by 
the competent authorities of that Party in accordance with Articles 3 and 
4.2(c) of the WTO Agreement on Safeguards; and to this end, Articles 3 and 
4.2(c) of the WTO Agreement on Safeguards are incorporated, mutatis 
mutandis, into and made a part of this Agreement; 
 
 
 
 7
(e) 
In undertaking the investigation described in Article 2.7.2.(d), a Party shall 
comply with the requirements of Articles 4.2(a) and (b) of the WTO 
Agreement on Safeguards; and to this end, Articles 4.2(a) and (b) are 
incorporated, mutatis mutandis, into and made a part of this Agreement; 
 
(f) 
The investigation shall be promptly terminated and no measure shall be 
taken if imports of the good under investigation represent less than 5 per 
cent of apparent domestic consumption or less than 10 per cent of total 
imports2; 
 
(g) 
The investigation shall in all cases be completed within one year following 
its date of initiation;  
 
(h) 
No measure shall be maintained: 
 
(i) 
except to the extent and for such time as may be necessary to 
remedy serious injury and to facilitate adjustment; 
 
(ii) 
for a period exceeding one year, except that in exceptional 
circumstances, the period may be extended by up to an additional 
two years, to a total maximum of three years from the date that the 
measure was first imposed, if the competent authorities of the Party 
applying such measure determine in conformity with procedures that 
are set out in Articles 2.7.2(a)-(g), that the safeguard measure 
continues to be necessary to prevent or remedy serious injury and to 
facilitate adjustment and that there is evidence that the industry is 
adjusting; or 
 
(iii) 
                                                
beyond the expiration of the transition period;  
 
(i)      No investigation or bilateral safeguard measure shall be applied to the 
import of a particular good which has been previously subject to any other 
safeguard investigation under this Article; and 
 
(j) 
Upon the termination of the safeguard measure, the rate of duty shall be the 
rate which would have been in effect if such measure was not applied. 
 
 
 
 
 
2 For the purposes of Article 2.7.2(f), the time frame to be used for calculating the applicable percentages 
shall be the 12 month period prior to the filing of an application to the Party requesting for the imposition of 
a safeguard measure.    
 8
Provisional Measures 
 
3. 
In critical circumstances where delay would cause damage which would be difficult 
to repair, a Party may take a measure described in Article 2.7.1(a), (b) or (c) on a 
provisional basis pursuant to a preliminary determination that there is clear 
evidence that imports from the other Party have increased as a result of the 
reduction or elimination of a customs duty under this Agreement, and such imports 
constitute a substantial cause of serious injury, or threat thereof, to the domestic 
industry.  The duration of such provisional measure shall not exceed 200 days, 
during which time the requirements of Articles 2.7.2(d) and 2.7.2(e) shall be met.  
Any increase in tariffs as a result of such provisional measure shall be promptly 
refunded if the investigation described in Article 2.7.2(d) does not result in a 
finding that the requirements of Article 2.7.1 are met.  The duration of any 
provisional measure shall be counted as part of the period described in Article 
2.7.2(g). 
 
Compensation 
 
4. 
The Party proposing to apply a measure described in Article 2.7.1 shall provide to 
the other Party mutually agreed adequate means of trade liberalizing compensation 
in the form of concessions having substantially equivalent trade effects or 
equivalent to the value of the additional duties expected to result from the measure. 
If the Parties are unable to agree on compensation within 30 days in the 
consultations under Article 2.7.2(c), the Party against whose originating good the 
measure is applied may take action having trade effects substantially equivalent to 
the measure applied under this Article. This action shall be applied only for the 
minimum period necessary to achieve the substantially equivalent trade effects. 
However, the right to take compensatory action shall not be exercised for the first 
24 months from the date that the measure was applied, provided that the measure 
has been applied as a result of an absolute increase in imports and that the measure 
is in accordance with this Article. 
 
Administration of Safeguard Investigation Proceedings 
 
5.  
Each Party shall: 
 
(a)  
ensure the consistent, impartial and reasonable administration of its laws, 
regulations, decisions and rulings governing all investigations described in 
Article 2.7.2(d);  
 
(b) 
entrust determinations of serious injury in safeguard investigation 
proceedings to a competent investigating authority, subject to review by 
judicial or administrative tribunals, to the extent provided by domestic law. 
Negative injury determinations shall not be subject to modification, except 
 9
by such review.  The competent investigating authority empowered under 
domestic law to conduct such proceedings should be provided with the 
necessary resources to enable it to fulfil its duties; and  
 
(c) 
adopt or maintain fair, timely, transparent and effective procedures for 
investigations described in Article 2.7.2(d). 
 
 
 
Global Safeguard Measures 
 
6. 
Each Party retains its rights and obligations under Article XIX of the GATT 1994 
and the WTO Agreement on Safeguards.  This Agreement does not confer any 
additional rights or obligations on the Parties with regard to actions taken pursuant 
to Article XIX of the GATT 1994 and the WTO Agreement on Safeguards, except 
that a Party taking a safeguard measure under Article XIX of the GATT 1994 and 
the WTO Agreement on Safeguards may exclude imports of an originating good 
from the other Party if such imports are not a substantial cause of serious injury or 
threat thereof. 
 
Prohibition of Safeguard Investigations 
 
7. 
No safeguard investigation described in Article 2.7.2(d) shall be initiated against a 
good, if the good is the subject matter of an anti-dumping measure. 
 
 
Article 2.8 
Anti-Dumping Measures 
 
1. 
Except as otherwise provided in this Article, each Party retains its rights and 
obligations under the WTO Agreement on the Implementation of Article VI of the 
GATT 1994 (WTO Anti-Dumping Agreement). For the purposes of this 
Agreement, both Parties agree to the following changes in terms of implementation 
of the WTO Anti-Dumping Agreement, in order to bring greater discipline to anti-
dumping investigations and to minimise the opportunities to use anti-dumping in an 
arbitrary or protectionist manner: 
 
(a) 
the de minimis margin of 2 per cent, expressed as a percentage of the export 
price below which there shall be immediate termination of an investigation 
as provided for in Article 5.8 of the WTO Anti-Dumping Agreement, is 
raised to 5 per cent; 
 
 
 10
(b) 
the volume of dumped imports normally regarded as negligible under 
Article 5.8 of the WTO Anti-Dumping Agreement is raised from 3 per cent 
to 5 per cent of imports of the like good in the importing Party, below 
which there shall be an immediate termination of an investigation; 
 
(c) 
Articles 2.8.1(a) and (b) shall apply to investigations and review cases 
initiated after the entry into force of this Agreement; 
 
(d) 
Article 14 of the WTO Anti-Dumping Agreement on third country dumping 
shall not be applied by the Parties; 
 
(e) 
the time frame to be used for determining material injury, calculation of the 
volume of dumped imports in an investigation or review shall be 
representative of the imports of both dumped and non-dumped goods and 
shall be for a reasonable period, and such reasonable period shall normally 
be at least 12 months;  
 
(f) 
any anti-dumping duty shall be terminated on a date not later than 3 years 
from the date that the duty was imposed. In exceptional circumstances, the 
authorities of the Party applying such measure may initiate such review and 
consider the continued application of such measure; 
 
(g) 
if a decision is taken to impose anti-dumping duty pursuant to Article 9.1 of 
the WTO Anti-Dumping Agreement, the  Party taking such a decision, shall 
where possible, apply the ‘lesser duty’ rule, i.e. a duty which is less than the 
dumping margin where such lesser duty would be adequate to remove the 
injury to the domestic injury; and 
 
(h) 
in the conduct of investigations and reviews, the margin of dumping and the 
resulting dumping duty based on such margin shall be calculated by  strict 
price comparison on the basis of transaction to transaction, and weighted 
average to weighted average, and not weighted-average price and individual 
price. Where weighted-average prices are used, such prices shall be 
calculated based on the entire period of investigation, and not any particular 
period therein. 
 
2. 
Immediately following the acceptance of a properly documented application from 
an industry in a Party for the initiation of an anti-dumping investigation in respect 
of goods from the other Party, the Party that has accepted the properly documented 
application shall immediately inform the other Party of the acceptance of the 
application. Should the recipient Party observe any variation in the volume 
statistics relating to exports and imports, consultations with a view to reaching a 
satisfactory solution shall take place upon the recipient Party’s request and such 
solution shall be reached within 30 days from receipt of such request.  
 11
 
3. 
No anti-dumping investigations shall be initiated against a good if that good is 
subject to a safeguard measure under Article 2.7. 
 
 
Article 2.9 
Restrictions to Safeguard the Balance of Payments 
 
Article XII of the GATT 1994 and the Understanding on the Balance-of-Payments 
Provisions of the GATT 1994 shall apply to measures taken by any Party for balance of 
payments purposes for trade in goods. 
 
 
Article 2.10 
General Exceptions 
 
Subject to the requirement that such measures are not applied in a manner which would 
constitute a means of arbitrary or unjustifiable discrimination between the Parties where 
the same conditions prevail, or a disguised restriction on international trade, nothing in this 
Agreement shall be construed to prevent the adoption or enforcement by any Party of 
measures: 
 
(a) 
necessary to protect public morals; 
 
(b) 
necessary to protect human, animal or plant life or health; 
 
(c) 
relating to the importations or exportations of gold or silver;  
 
(d) 
necessary to secure compliance with laws or regulations which are not 
inconsistent with the provisions of this Agreement, including those relating 
to customs enforcement, the enforcement of monopolies operated under 
paragraph 4 of Article II and Article XVII of the GATT 1994, the 
protection  of patents, trade marks and copyrights, and the prevention of 
deceptive practices; 
 
(e) 
relating to the products of prison labour; 
 
(f) 
imposed for the protection of national treasures of artistic, historic or 
archaeological value; 
 
(g) 
relating to the conservation of exhaustible natural resources if such 
measures are made effective in conjunction with restrictions on domestic 
production or consumption; 
 
 12
(h) 
undertaken in pursuance of obligations under any intergovernmental 
commodity agreement which conforms to criteria submitted to the WTO 
and not disapproved by it or which is itself so submitted and not so 
disapproved; 
 
(i) 
involving restrictions on exports of domestic materials necessary to ensure 
essential quantities of such materials to a domestic processing industry 
during periods when the domestic price of such materials is held below the 
world price as part of a governmental stabilization plan; provided that such 
restrictions shall not operate to increase the exports of or the protection 
afforded to such domestic industry, and shall not depart from the provisions 
of this Agreement relating to non discrimination; 
 
(j) 
essential to the acquisition or distribution of products in general or local 
short supply; provided that any such measures shall be consistent with the 
principle that all WTO members are entitled to an equitable share of the 
international supply of such products, and that any such measures which are 
inconsistent with the other provisions of this Agreement shall be 
discontinued as soon as the conditions giving rise to them have ceased to 
exist.
