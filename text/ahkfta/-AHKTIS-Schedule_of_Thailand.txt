1. 
The classification of service sectors in this schedule is based on the 1991 provisional 
Central Product Classification (CPC) and CPC Version 1.1 of the United Nations 
Statistical Office unless otherwise indicated by the absence of a CPC number. The 
ordering reflects the services sectoral classification list as used in the GATT 
document MTN.GNS/W/120 dated 10 July 1991. The scheduling of specific 
commitments follows the guidelines stated in GATT documents MTN.GNS/W/164 
dated 3 September 1993 and MTN.GNS/W/164/Add.1 dated 30 November 1993. 
 
2. 
The use of “**” against individual CPC codes indicates that the specific commitment 
for that code shall not extend to the total range of services covered under that code. 
The entry “Unbound*” means unbound due to lack of technical feasibility.
