Reference Paper 
 
Scope 
 
The following are definitions and principles on the regulatory framework for the basic 
telecommunications services. 
 
 
Definitions 
 
Users mean service consumers and service suppliers. 
 
Essential facilities mean facilities of a public telecommunications transport network or service 
that: 
 
(a) 
are exclusively or predominantly provided by a single or limited number of suppliers; and 
 
(b) 
cannot feasibly be economically or technically substituted in order to provide a service. 
 
A major supplier is a supplier which has the ability to materially affect the terms of participation 
(having regard to price and supply) in relevant market for basic telecommunications services as 
a result of: 
 
(a) 
control over essential facilities; or 
 
(b) 
use of its position in the market. 
 
 
1. 
Competitive safeguards 
 
1.1. 
Prevention of anti-competitive practices in telecommunications 
 
Appropriate measures shall be maintained for the purpose of preventing suppliers who, 
alone or together, are a major supplier from engaging in or continuing anti-competitive 
practices. 
 
1.2. 
Safeguards 
 
The anti-competitive practices referred to above shall include in particular: 
 
(a) 
engaging in anti-competitive cross-subsidization; 
(b) 
 
(b) 
using information obtained from competitors with anti-competitive results; and 
 
(c) 
not making available to other services suppliers on timely basis technical 
information about essential facilities and commercially relevant information which 
are necessary for them to provide services. 
 
 
2. 
Interconnection 
 
AHKFTA – Annex 8-1 (Cambodia) 
35 
 
2.1. 
This section applies to linking with suppliers, providing public telecommunications 
transport networks or services in order to allow the users of one supplier to communicate 
with users of another supplier and to access services provided by another supplier, 
where specific commitments are undertaken. 
 
2.2. 
Interconnection to be ensured 
 
Interconnection with a major supplier will be ensured at any technically feasible point in 
the network. Such interconnection is provided: 
 
(a) 
under non-discriminatory terms, conditions (incl. technical standards and 
specifications) and rates and of a quality no less favourable than that provided for 
its own like services or for like services of non-affiliated service suppliers or for its 
subsidiaries or other affiliates; 
 
(b) 
in a timely fashion, on terms, conditions (incl. technical standards and 
specifications) and cost-oriented rates that are transparent, reasonable, having 
regard to economic feasibility, and sufficiently unbundled so that the supplier 
need not pay for network components or facilities that it does not require for the 
service to be provided; and 
 
(c) 
upon request, at points in addition to the network termination points offered to the 
majority of users, subject to charges that reflect the cost of construction of 
necessary additional facilities. 
 
2.3. 
Public availability of the procedures for interconnection negotiations 
 
The procedures applicable for interconnection to a major supplier will be made publicly 
available. 
 
2.4. 
Transparency of interconnection arrangements 
 
It is ensured that a major supplier will make publicly available either its interconnection 
agreements or a reference interconnection offer. 
2.5. 
Interconnection: dispute settlement 
 
A service supplier requesting interconnection with a major supplier will have recourse, 
either: 
 
(a) 
at any time or 
 
(b) 
after a reasonable period of time which has been made publicly known to an 
independent domestic body, which may be a regulatory body as referred to in 
paragraph 5 below, to resolve disputes regarding appropriate terms, conditions 
and rates for interconnection within a reasonable period of time, to the extent that 
these have not been established previously. 
 
3. 
Universal service 
 
Any Member has the right to define the kind of universal service obligation it wishes to 
maintain. Such obligations will not be regarded as anti-competitive per se, provided they 
 
AHKFTA – Annex 8-1 (Cambodia) 
36 
 
are administered in a transparent, non-discriminatory and competitively neutral manner 
and are not more burdensome than necessary for the kind of universal service defined 
by the Member. 
 
 
4. 
Public availability of licencing criteria 
 
Where a licence is required, the following will be made publicly available: 
 
(a) 
all the licensing criteria and the period of time normally required to reach a 
decision concerning an application for a licence and 
 
(b) 
the terms and conditions of individual licences. 
 
The reasons for the denial of a licence will be made known to the applicant upon 
request. 
 
 
5. 
Independent regulators 
 
The regulatory body is separate from, and not accountable to, any supplier of basic 
telecommunications services. The decisions of and the procedures used by regulators 
shall be impartial with respect to all market participants. 
 
 
6. 
Allocation and use of scarce resources 
 
Any procedures for the allocation and use of scarce resources, including frequencies, 
numbers and rights of way, will be carried out in an objective, timely, transparent and 
non-discriminatory manner. The current state of allocated frequency bands will be made 
publicly available, but detailed identification of frequencies allocated for specific 
government uses is not required.
