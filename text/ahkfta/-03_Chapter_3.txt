If a good is subject to a RVC-based rule of origin, the value of the accessories, spare parts, tools and instructional or information materials shall be taken into account as the value of the originating or non-originating materials, as the case may be, in calculating the RVC of the good.  Article 13  Neutral Elements  In order to determine whether a good is an originating good, it shall not be necessary to determine the origin of the following which might be used in its production and not incorporated into the good:  (a) fuel and energy;  36  (b) tools, dies and moulds;  (c) spare parts and materials used in the maintenance of equipment and buildings;  (d) lubricants, greases, compounding materials and other materials used in production or used to operate equipment and buildings;  (e) gloves, glasses, footwear, clothing, safety equipment and supplies;  (f) equipment, devices and supplies used for testing or inspecting the good;  (g) catalysts and solvents; and  (h) any other goods that are not incorporated into the good but  the use of which in the production of the good can reasonably be demonstrated to be a part of that production.
