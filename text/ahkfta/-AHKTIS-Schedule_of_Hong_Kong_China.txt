Additional Commitments on Regulatory Principles 
 
Scope 
 
The  following  are  definitions  and  principles  on  the  regulatory  framework  for  basic 
telecommunications services. 
 
Definitions 
 
Users mean service consumers and service suppliers. 
 
Essential  facilities  mean facilities of a public telecommunications transport network or 
service that: 
 
(a)  are exclusively or predominantly provided by a single or limited number of 
suppliers; and 
 
(b)  cannot feasibly be economically or technically substituted in order to provide a 
service. 
 
A  major  supplier is a supplier which has the ability to materially affect the terms of 
participation  (having  regard  to  price  and  supply)  in  the  relevant  market  for  basic 
telecommunications services as a result of: 
 
  (a)  control over essential facilities; or 
 
  (b)  use of its position in the market. 
 
1.  Competitive safeguards 
 
1.1  Prevention of anti-competitive practices in telecommunications 
 
  Appropriate measures shall be maintained for the purpose of preventing suppliers who, 
alone or together, are a major supplier from engaging in or continuing anti-competitive 
practices. 
 
1.2  Safeguards 
 
  The anti-competitive practices referred to above shall include in particular: 
 
  (a)  engaging in anti-competitive cross-subsidisation; 
 
  (b)  using information obtained from competitors with anti-competitive results; and 
 
  (c)  not  making  available  to  other services  suppliers  on  a  timely basis  technical 
information  about  essential  facilities  and  commercially  relevant  information 
which are necessary for them to provide services. 
 
 
 
41    
2.  Interconnection 
 
2.1  This section applies to linking with suppliers providing public telecommunications 
transport networks or services in order to allow the users of one supplier to communicate 
with users of another supplier and to access services provided by another supplier, where 
specific commitments are undertaken. 
 
2.2  Interconnection to be ensured 
 
  Interconnection with a major supplier will be ensured at any technically feasible point 
in the network.  Such interconnection is provided: 
 
(a)  under non-discriminatory terms, conditions (including technical standards and 
specifications) and rates and of a quality no less favourable than that provided for 
its own like services or for like services of non-affiliated service suppliers or for 
its subsidiaries or other affiliates; 
 
(b)  in  a  timely  fashion,  on  terms,  conditions  (including  technical  standards  and 
specifications) and cost-oriented rates that are transparent, reasonable, having 
regard to economic feasibility, and sufficiently unbundled so that the supplier 
need not pay for network components or facilities that it does not require for the 
service to be provided; and 
 
(c)  upon request, at points in addition to the network termination points offered to the 
majority of users, subject  to  charges that reflect  the  cost of construction of 
necessary additional facilities. 
 
2.3  Public availability of the procedures for interconnection negotiations 
 
  The  procedures  applicable  for  interconnection to  a  major  supplier  will  be  made 
publicly available. 
 
2.4  Transparency of interconnection arrangements 
 
  It  is  ensured  that  a  major  supplier  will  make  publicly  available  either  its 
interconnection agreements or a reference interconnection offer. 
 
2.5  Interconnection: dispute settlement 
 
  A service supplier requesting interconnection with a major supplier will have recourse, 
either: 
 
  (a)  at any time; or 
 
  (b)  after a reasonable period of time which has been made publicly known, 
 
to an independent domestic body, which may be a regulator as referred to in paragraph 5, to 
resolve disputes regarding appropriate terms, conditions and rates for interconnection within 
a reasonable period of time, to the extent that these have not been established previously. 
 
 
 
42    
3.  Universal service 
 
  Hong Kong, China has the right to define the kind of universal service obligation it 
wishes  to  maintain.    Such  obligations  will  not  be  regarded  as  anti-competitive  per  se, 
provided they are administered in a transparent, non-discriminatory and competitively neutral 
manner and are not more burdensome than necessary for the kind of universal service defined 
by Hong Kong, China. 
 
4.  Public availability of licensing criteria 
 
  Where a licence is required, the following will be made publicly available: 
 
(a)  all the licensing criteria and the period of time normally required to reach a 
decision concerning an application for a licence; and 
 
  (b)  the terms and conditions of individual licences. 
 
  The reasons for the denial of a licence will be made known to the applicant upon 
request. 
 
5.  Independent regulators 
 
  The  regulator  is  separate  from,  and  not  accountable  to,  any  supplier  of  basic 
telecommunications services.  The decisions of and the procedures used by regulators shall be 
impartial with respect to all market participants. 
 
6.  Allocation and use of scarce resources 
 
  Any procedures for the allocation and use of scarce resources, including frequencies, 
numbers and rights of way, will be carried out in an objective, timely, transparent and non-
discriminatory manner.  The current state of allocated frequency bands will be made publicly 
available, but detailed identification of frequencies allocated for specific government uses is 
not required.
