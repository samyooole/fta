REFERENCE PAPER 
I.  SCOPE 
  The following are definitions and principles on the regulatory framework for the basic 
telecommunications services.   
Definitions 
  Users mean service consumers and service suppliers.   
  Essential facilities mean facilities of a public telecommunications transport network or 
service that 
(a)  are exclusively or predominantly provided by a single or limited number of 
suppliers; and 
(b)  cannot feasibly be economically or technically substituted in order to provide 
a service. 
  A major supplier is a supplier which has the ability to materially affect the terms of 
participation  (having  regard  to  price  and  supply)  in  the  relevant  market  for  basic 
telecommunications services as a result of: 
  (a)  control over essential facilities; or 
  (b)  use of its position in the market. 
1.  Competitive safeguards 
1.1  Prevention of anti-competitive practices in telecommunications 
  Appropriate measures shall be maintained for the purpose of preventing suppliers 
who, alone or together, are a major supplier from engaging in or continuing anti-
competitive practices. 
1.2  Safeguards 
  The anti-competitive practices referred to above shall include in particular: 
(a)  engaging in anti-competitive cross-subsidization;   
  (b)  using information obtained from competitors with anti-competitive results; and 
(c)  not making available to other services suppliers on a timely basis technical 
information  about  essential  facilities  and  commercially  relevant  information  which  are 
necessary for them to provide services. 
2.  Interconnection 
2.1  This section applies to linking with suppliers providing public telecommunications 
transport  networks  or  services  in  order  to  allow  the  users  of  one  supplier  to 
communicate with users of another supplier and to access services provided by 
another supplier, where specific commitments are undertaken. 
AHKFTA – Annex 8-1 (Viet Nam)   
  
2.2  Interconnection to be ensured 
  Interconnection with a major supplier will be ensured at any technically feasible point 
in the network.  Such interconnection is provided. 
(a)  under non-discriminatory terms, conditions (including technical standards and 
specifications)  and  rates  and  of  a  quality  no  less  favourable  than  that 
provided for its own like services or for like services of non-affiliated service 
suppliers or for its subsidiaries or other affiliates; 
(b)  in a timely fashion, on terms, conditions (including technical standards and 
specifications)  and  cost-oriented  rates  that  are  transparent,  reasonable, 
having regard to economic feasibility, and sufficiently unbundled so that the 
supplier need not pay for network components or facilities that it does not 
require for the service to be provided; and 
(c)  upon request, at points in addition to the network termination points offered to 
the majority of users, subject to charges that reflect the cost of construction of 
necessary additional facilities. 
2.3  Public availability of the procedures for interconnection negotiations 
  The  procedures  applicable  for  interconnection  to  a  major  supplier  will  be  made 
publicly available. 
2.4  Transparency of interconnection arrangements 
  It  is  ensured  that  a  major  supplier  will  make  publicly  available  either  its 
interconnection agreements or a reference interconnection offer. 
2.5  Interconnection:  dispute settlement 
  A  service  supplier  requesting  interconnection  with  a  major  supplier  will  have 
recourse, either: 
  (a)  at any time; or 
(b)  after a reasonable period of time which has been made publicly known to an 
independent domestic body, which may be a regulatory body as referred to in 
paragraph  5  below,  to  resolve  disputes  regarding  appropriate  terms, 
conditions and rates for interconnection within a reasonable period of time, to 
the extent that these have not been established previously. 
3.  Universal service 
  Any Party has the right to define the kind of universal service obligation it wishes to 
maintain.  Such obligations will not be regarded as anti-competitive per se, provided 
they are administered in a transparent, non-discriminatory and competitively neutral 
manner and are not more burdensome than necessary for the kind of universal 
service defined by the Party. 
4.  Public availability of licensing criteria 
  Where a licence is required, the following will be made publicly available: 
(a)  all the licensing criteria and the period of time normally required to reach a 
decision concerning an application for a licence; and 
(b)  the terms and conditions of individual licenses. 
AHKFTA – Annex 8-1 (Viet Nam)  75 
  
  The reasons for the denial of a licence will be made known to the applicant upon 
request. 
5.  Independent regulators 
  The regulatory body is separate from, and not accountable to, any supplier of basic 
telecommunications  services.  The  decisions  of  and  the  procedures  used  by 
regulators shall be impartial with respect to all market participants. 
6.  Allocation and use of scarce resources 
  Any procedures for the allocation and use of scarce resources, including frequencies, 
numbers and rights of way, will be carried out in an objective, timely, transparent and 
non-discriminatory manner.  The current state of allocated frequency bands will be 
made  publicly  available,  but  detailed  identification  of  frequencies  allocated  for 
specific government uses is not required.
