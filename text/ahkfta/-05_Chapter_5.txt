(a)  the definitions in Annex A of the SPS Agreement 
are incorporated into and shall form part of this 
Chapter, mutatis mutandis; and

Article 2 
 
Objectives 
 
The objectives of this Chapter are to: 
 
(a)

(b) 
facilitate trade by minimising obstacles to trade 
among the Parties, while protecting human, 
animal or plant life or health in the Area of each 
Party; 
 
(c) 
enhance transparency such that sanitary and 
phytosanitary measures shall not be applied in a 
128 
 
manner which would constitute a disguised 
restriction on international trade; 
 
(d) 
strengthen co-operation and communication 
among the Parties in the field of sanitary and 
phytosanitary matters; and 
 
(e) 
provide a means to resolve, where possible, 
problems arising from sanitary and phytosanitary 
measures that may affect trade.

Equivalence 
 
1. 
The 
Parties 
may 
develop

if the exporting Party objectively demonstrates to the 
importing Party that its measures achieve the importing 
Partyâ€™s appropriate level of sanitary and phytosanitary 
protection. 
 
3. 
A Party shall, upon request of another Party, 
enter into consultations with the requesting Party with 
the aim of achieving agreements on recognition of the 
equivalence of specified sanitary or phytosanitary 
measures.  In the event that an outcome of the 
assessment of such consultations is negative, the 
importing Party should explain its rationale for the 
outcome.

guidance of the WTO Committee on Sanitary and 
Phytosanitary Measures and relevant international 
standards, guidelines and recommendations.

measure against or affecting the exports of 
another Party is considered necessary to 
protect human, animal or plant life or health of 
the importing Party.
