JAPAN’S SCHEDULE OF SPECIFIC COMMITMENTS
EXPLANATORY NOTES
1.
Alphabets indicated against individual sectors or subsectors and
numbers in brackets are references to the Services Sectoral
Classification List (GATT Document MTN.GNS/W/120, dated
10 July 1991) and the Provisional Central Product Classification
(Statistical Papers Series M No. 77, Department of International
Economic and Social Affairs, Statistical Office of the United Nations,
New York, 1991).  These alphabetical and numerical divisions are
indicated to enhance the clarity in the description of specific
commitments, but shall not be construed as being a part of the specific
commitments.
2.
The scheduling of specific commitments follows the Guidelines for the
Scheduling of Specific Commitments (WTO Document S/L/92, dated 28
March 2001). The Guidelines shall not, however, be construed as being
legally binding.
3.
The modes of supply 1), 2), 3) and 4) indicated in this Schedule
correspond respectively to the supply of services defined in (i),(ii),(iii) and
(iv) of sub-paragraph (o) of paragraph 6 of Article 58.
4.
The entry “Unbound*” means unbound due to lack of technical feasibility.
5.
The use of   “**” against individual CPC codes indicates that the specific
commitment for that code does not extend to the total range of services
covered under that code.
6.
Measures affecting (a) Passenger transport services by air; (b) Freight
transport services by air; and (c) Rental/Leasing services of aircraft
with crew/operator are not listed in this Schedule, as these are
measures affecting traffic rights or measures affecting services directly
related to the exercise of traffic rights to which this Agreement does
not apply. The commitment for Freight Transport Agency services
does not include freight forwarding services by air transport services.
7.
Cabotage services in the maritime transport sector are not listed in this
Schedule, as Chapter 7 does not apply to those services.
8.
A person who is permitted to supply road freight transportation
services, may also engage in the activities of pick-up, delivery, sorting,
conveyance and distribution of freight, in accordance with the specific
commitments in road freight transportation services. The following

ALL SECTORS
INCLUDED IN THIS
SCHEDULE
4) Horizontal Commitments in
Mode 4) of this column are
the same as those specific
commitments in Part A of
Annex VI.
3) Unbound for research and development
subsidies
There may be limitations on the treatment
accorded to the service suppliers who have
the right of permanent residence in
Singapore, where Japan adopts or maintains
measures pursuant to its domestic laws and
regulations whose implementation would be
prejudiced if the treatment accorded to service
suppliers who have the right of permanent
residence in Singapore is equivalent to the
treatment accorded to service suppliers who
are nationals of Singapore.
Such measures include those pursuant to
sub-paragraph 3.2 of Article 27 of the Foreign
Exchange and Trade Law (Law No. 228,
1949). In respect of service suppliers who
have the right of permanent residence in
Singapore, to whom sub-paragraph 3.2 of
Article 27 is applicable on the basis of their
nationality, notification to competent
authorities is required prior to supply of
service in all sectors.
In cases where Japan takes any measures
mentioned above, Japan will notify Singapore
of the description of the measure before such
a measure is taken.
With reference to the Foreign Exchange and
Foreign Trade Law, Japan will notify
Singapore before any new country is added to
the list of countries to which sub-paragraph
3.2 of Article 27 applies.

The term “other forms of commercial presence for the supply of international maritime transport services” means the ability for
international maritime transport service suppliers of Singapore to undertake in Japan all activities which are necessary for the
supply to their customers of a partially or fully integrated transport service, within which the maritime transport constitutes a
substantial element. (This commitment shall however not be construed as limiting in any manner the commitments undertaken
under Mode 1).)
These activities include, but are not limited to:
(a)
marketing and sales of maritime transport and related services through direct contact with customers, from quotation to
invoicing, these services being those operated or offered by the service supplier itself or by service suppliers with which
the service seller has established standing business arrangements;
(b)
the acquisition, on their own account or on behalf of their customers (and the resale to their customers) of any domestic
transport and related services, including inward transport services by any mode, particularly inland waterways, road and
rail, but excluding air, necessary for the supply of the integrated service;
(c)
the preparation of documentation concerning transport documents, customs documents or other documents related to the
origin and character of the goods transported;
(d)
the provision of business information by any means, including computerised information systems and electronic data
interchange (subject to the provisions of Annex IVB);
(e)
the setting up of any business arrangements (including participation in the stock of a company) and the appointment of
personnel recruited locally (or, in the case of foreign personnel, subject to the horizontal commitments in Part A of Annex
VI) with any locally established shipping agency;
(f)
acting on behalf of the companies, organising the call of the ship or taking over cargoes when required.
