with respect to matters relating to several
Chapters, the term “regional and local governments and
authorities” as used in the Marrakesh Agreement

adopts any findings or recommendations that affect the
understanding of that paragraph, such as those on the

the Agreement:
 
(i) 
a determination that an originating good is
being imported as a result of the reduction
or elimination of a customs duty provided
for in Article 14 of the Agreement shall be
made only if such reduction or elimination
is a cause which contributes significantly
to the increase in imports;
 
(ii) 
the passage of a period of time between the
commencement or termination of such
reduction or elimination and the increase in
imports shall not by itself preclude the
determination referred to in sub-paragraph
(i) above; and
 
(iii) 
if the increase in imports is demonstrably
unrelated to such reduction or elimination,
the determination referred to in sub-

criteria provided for in (i) of sub-paragraph (m) of

in the case of juridical persons provided

in the case of the Republic of Singapore
(hereinafter referred to as “Singapore”):
 
(i) 
the term “measures by a Party” defined in
sub-paragraph (p) of paragraph 6 of Article
58 does not include the activities of
juridical persons(Note) in whose daily
operational decisions the government is not
directly involved, unless such juridical
persons are non-governmental bodies that
exercise powers delegated by the government.
This applies even if the government owns
equity interest thereof, names directors
thereto, or provides funding thereto; and
Note: “The activities of juridical persons” include
the disposal (including divestment) of equity
interest of juridical persons.
 
(ii) 
such juridical persons (except for those
that are not service suppliers) and their
services are accorded the same treatment
that other juridical persons (except for
those that are not service suppliers) and
their services are accorded pursuant to
Chapter 7;
5
(6)
with respect to Chapter 8 (Investment):
(a) 
market access measures, as provided for in
Chapter 7, which are applied on a national treatment
basis, are deemed to be not inconsistent with Chapter
8;
(b) 
with reference to sub-paragraph (h) of Article 72
of the Agreement, an enterprise of a Party is not
regarded as being engaged in substantive business
operations in the territory of that Party if it does
not undertake real and continuous business activities
in the territory of that Party;
(c) 
with reference to paragraph 1 of Article 75 of
the Agreement:
 
(i) 
if one Party takes measures intended to
restrict the domestic availability of goods
and services to consumers within its
territory, such measures are deemed not
inconsistent with the obligation under
paragraph 1 of Article 75 provided that such
measures are not intended to afford
protection, to accord preference to domestic
providers of that Party or to adjust the
balance of payments; and
 
(ii) 
all conditions pertaining to licensing which
are based on voluntary commitments in
writing by an investor are deemed not to be
prohibited performance requirements under
paragraph 1 of Article 75;
(d) 
with reference to paragraph 2 of Article 77 of
the Agreement:
 
(i) 
the purposes specified in section 5(1)(b)
and (c) of Singapore’s Land Acquisition Act
(Cap. 152) as in force on 13th January 2002,
are examples of “public purpose” as provided
for in paragraph 2 of Article 77; and
 
(ii) 
the requirement of “public purpose” is
deemed to be satisfied, if the measures are
taken for the public use, the public welfare
or the public benefit, or in the public
interest, including, in the case of
Singapore, the purposes provided for in the
said Land Acquisition Act (Cap. 152);
6
(e) 
with reference to paragraph 3 of Article 77 of
the Agreement:
 
(i) 
the phrase “the laws of the expropriating
Party concerning the expropriation”, in the
case of Singapore, refers to the Land
Acquisition Act (Cap. 152), as in force on
13th January 2002; and
 
(ii) 
if this Act is amended so as to change the
amount of compensation which is payable for
expropriated land, such amendments:
(A) 
shall be applicable for the purpose of
paragraph 3 of Article 77 should the
amendments place investors of Japan in
a more advantageous situation than if
the amendments had not been effected;
and
(B) 
shall not be applicable for the purpose
of paragraph 3 of Article 77 in any
other case;
(f) 
with reference to paragraph 4 of Article 77 of
the Agreement, in the case of Singapore, where land is
subjected to compulsory acquisition, the time of
expropriation for the purpose of computing the
interest that would be payable shall be the date of
physical possession of the land;
(g) 
with reference to Article 78 of the Agreement, in
the case of Singapore, the agency of the Government of
Singapore responsible for leasing industrial land
stipulated in Article 78 is, at the time of entry into
force of the Agreement, the Jurong Town Corporation,
for such time as it continues to be a statutory board
created by the Jurong Town Corporation Act;
(h) 
with reference to Article 80 of the Agreement,
the laws relating to criminal matters referred to in
sub-paragraph (c) of paragraph 3 of Article 80 include
laws relating to the forfeiture of proceeds of crime;
7
(i) 
with reference to Article 82 of the Agreement,
the administrative settlement referred to in paragraph
3 of Article 82 means, in the case of Japan, the
administrative procedures through which an independent
institute or Commission renders a decision, equivalent
to a judicial decision, which is subject to appeal to
a judicial body, such as hearing procedures before the
Fair Trade Commission and the Marine Accidents Inquiry
Agency;
(j) 
with reference to Articles 77 and 87 of the
Agreement, in assessing whether a taxation measure
constitutes expropriation, the following
considerations are relevant:
 
(i) 
the imposition of taxes does not generally
constitute expropriation.  The mere
introduction of new taxation measures or the
imposition of taxes in more than one
jurisdiction in respect of an investment,
does not in and of itself constitute
expropriation;
 
(ii) 
taxation measures which are consistent with
internationally recognised tax policies,
principles and practices do not constitute
expropriation.  In particular, taxation
measures aimed at preventing the avoidance
or evasion of taxes should not, generally,
be considered to be expropriatory; and
 
(iii) 
taxation measures which are applied on a
non-discriminatory basis, as opposed to
being targeted at investors of a particular
nationality or specific individual taxpayers,
are less likely to constitute expropriation.
A taxation measure should not constitute
expropriation if, when the investment is
made, it was already in force, and
information about the measure was made
public or otherwise made publicly available;
and
8
(k) 
in the case of Singapore:
 
(i) 
the term “measures adopted or maintained by
a Party” referred to in paragraph 1 of
Article 71 does not include the activities
of enterprises(Note) in whose daily
operational decisions the government is not
directly involved unless such enterprises
are non-governmental bodies that exercise
powers delegated by the government.  This
applies even if the government owns equity
interest thereof, names directors thereto,
or provides funding thereto; and
Note: “The activities of enterprises” include the
disposal (including divestment) of equity
interest of enterprises.
 
(ii) 
such enterprises (except for those that are
not investors) and their investments are
accorded the same treatment that other
enterprises (except for those that are not
investors) and their investments are
accorded pursuant to Chapter 8;
(7)
with respect to Chapter 9 (Movement of Natural
Persons):
(a) 
“nationality” referred to in paragraph 2 of
Article 90 of the Agreement only applies to Japan and
“citizenship” referred to in the same paragraph only
applies to Singapore; and
(b) 
with reference to Article 93 of the Agreement,
when a Party recognises professional qualifications
granted in the territory of the other Party, the mere
fact of such recognition does not mean the automatic
liberalisation of immigration measures by the
recognising Party.  Nothing in the preceding sentence
shall be understood to prejudice the application of
paragraph 2 of Article 95 of the Agreement; and
(8)
with respect to Annexes to the Agreement:
(a) 
with reference to paragraph 3 of IV of Annex IV B
to the Agreement, Japan is not obliged to require a
major supplier to allow other suppliers to locate
their equipment or to install their cables and lines,
which are essential for interconnection, in areas
outside the buildings and building sites of the major
supplier;
9
(b) 
with reference to Annex VI to the Agreement, the
following part of paragraph 34 of the Guidelines for
the Scheduling of Specific Commitments (WTO Document
S/L/92, dated 28 March 2001) does not apply to the
specific commitments undertaken by Japan in B of Part
A of the specific commitments of Japan:
“With respect to the fourth mode of supply, many
participants have chosen to inscribe their bound
commitments in the form of undertakings rather than in
the form of market access limitations.  In such cases
the bound measures affecting the entry and temporary
stay of natural persons are explicitly stated.  Thus,
in the absence of a reference to a specific duration
for the temporary stay of a foreign service supplier,
it could be understood that no binding is being
undertaken in respect of the duration of that
stay.  ...Commitments should include the duration of
temporary stay of natural persons for the purpose of
supplying a service”; and
(c) 
with reference to Annex VII B to the Agreement,
the entities of Japan which have been privatised, as
provided for in Article 101, are as follows:
Japan Tobacco Inc.
Hokkaido Railway Company
East Japan Railway Company
Central Japan Railway Company
West Japan Railway Company
Shikoku Railway Company
Kyushu Railway Company
Japan Freight Railway Company
