ANNEX IIA
PRODUCT-SPECIFIC RULES
EXPLANATORY NOTES
1.
This Annex is made based on the Harmonized System as amended on 1
January 2002.
2.
For the purpose of calculating the value content of non-originating
materials of a good pursuant to Chapter 22 of this Annex, the following
formula shall be applied:
N.O.M. = 
M.C.I.F.
x 
100
F.O.B.
Where
(a)
N.O.M. is the value content of non-originating materials of a good,
expressed as a percentage;
(b) 
M.C.I.F. is the C.I.F. value of non-originating materials used in the
production of a good, which is determined in accordance with the
Agreement on Customs Valuation, or, if this is not known and
cannot be ascertained, the first ascertainable price paid for the
material in the Party; and
(c)
F.O.B. is the value of a good as defined in sub-paragraph (b) of
paragraph 4 of Article 23.
3.
Where “natural textile fibres” or “man-made staple fibres” are referred to
in the Column “Rules” of Chapters 50 through 63 of this Annex:
(a) 
if materials of heading 50.01 are not referred to in the above-
mentioned “Rules”, “natural textile fibres” or “man-made
staple fibres” do not include either the mixture of “natural
textile fibres” with man-made filaments or the mixture of “man-
made staple fibres”  with man-made filaments; and
(b) 
if materials of heading 50.01 are referred to in the above-
mentioned “Rules”, “natural textile fibres” or “man-made
staple fibres” do not include either the mixture of  “natural
textile fibres” with man-made filaments or raw silk, or the
mixture of “man-made staple fibres”  with man-made filaments
or raw silk.
