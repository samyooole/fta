- Page 168 -ANNEX IIAPRODUCT-SPECIFIC RULESEXPLANATORY NOTES1.This Annex is made based on the Harmonized System as amended on 1January 2002.2.For the purpose of calculating the value content of non-originatingmaterials of a good pursuant to Chapter 22 of this Annex, the followingformula shall be applied:N.O.M. = M.C.I.F.x 100F.O.B.Where(a)N.O.M. is the value content of non-originating materials of a good,expressed as a percentage;(b) M.C.I.F. is the C.I.F. value of non-originating materials used in theproduction of a good, which is determined in accordance with theAgreement on Customs Valuation, or, if this is not known andcannot be ascertained, the first ascertainable price paid for thematerial in the Party; and(c)F.O.B. is the value of a good as defined in sub-paragraph (b) ofparagraph 4 of Article 23.3.Where “natural textile fibres” or “man-made staple fibres” are referred toin the Column “Rules” of Chapters 50 through 63 of this Annex:(a) if materials of heading 50.01 are not referred to in the above-mentioned “Rules”, “natural textile fibres” or “man-madestaple fibres” do not include either the mixture of “naturaltextile fibres” with man-made filaments or the mixture of “man-made staple fibres”  with man-made filaments; and(b) if materials of heading 50.01 are referred to in the above-mentioned “Rules”, “natural textile fibres” or “man-madestaple fibres” do not include either the mixture of  “naturaltextile fibres” with man-made filaments or raw silk, or themixture of “man-made staple fibres”  with man-made filamentsor raw silk.- Page 169
