SINGAPORE’S SCHEDULE OF SPECIFIC COMMITMENTS
EXPLANATORY NOTES
1.
The classification of service sectors in this Schedule is based on the 1991
provisional Central Product Classification (CPC) of the United Nations
Statistical Office unless otherwise indicated by the absence of a CPC number.
The ordering reflects the services sectoral classification list as used in the
GATT document MTN.GNS/W/120 dated 10 July 1991.  The scheduling of
specific commitments follows the guidelines stated in GATT documents
MTN.GNS/W/164 dated 3 September 1993 and MTN.GNS/W/164/Add.1
dated 30 November 1993.
2.
The use of  “ ** ” against individual CPC codes indicates that the specific
commitment for that code does not extend to the total range of services
covered under that code.  The entry “Unbound*” means unbound due to lack
of technical feasibility.
3.
There are two sections to this Schedule of specific commitments:
(a) 
Section I contains the horizontal commitments, which apply to all the
specific commitments made by Singapore; and
(b) 
Section II is a list of specific sectoral commitments;
prepared according to Article 63.
4.
Measures affecting (a) Passenger transport services by air; (b) Freight
transport services by air; and (c) Rental/Leasing services of aircraft with
crew/operator are not listed in this Schedule, as these are measures affecting
traffic rights or measures affecting services directly related to the exercise of
traffic rights to which this Agreement does not apply. The commitment for
Freight Transport Agency services does not include freight forwarding
services by air transport services.
5.
Cabotage services in the maritime transport sector are not listed in this
Schedule, as Chapter 7 does not apply to those services.

Facilities-Based Operators are operators that intend to deploy any form of telecommunication
networks, systems and facilities to offer telecommunication switching, transmission capacity and
services to existing licensed telecommunication operators, businesses and consumers.

The Info-communications Development Authority of Singapore (IDA) will consider favourably
applications by FBOs to be designated as PTLs if the FBO commits to substantial infrastructure
investment and rollout to offer services to a significant proportion of the population within a
reasonable time period. In return, a PTL’s network installation process and the maintenance and
protection of their networks receive special consideration under the Telecommunications Act
(Cap. 323).

These networks can have international, nationwide, local or selected local coverage.

Services-Based Operators are operators who lease telecommunications network elements (i.e.,
transmission capacity, switching services, ducts, fibre, etc.) from FBO Suppliers to provide

The term “approved school” used in Section 44(1) (g) of the Children & Young Persons Act (Cap.
38) denotes a remand home for young offenders, and not a mainstream educational institution.
Young offenders are detained in an “approved school” for rehabilitation rather than for formal
education.
