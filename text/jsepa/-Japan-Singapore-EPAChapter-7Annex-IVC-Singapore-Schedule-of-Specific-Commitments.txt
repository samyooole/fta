- Page 430 -SINGAPORE’S SCHEDULE OF SPECIFIC COMMITMENTSEXPLANATORY NOTES1.The classification of service sectors in this Schedule is based on the 1991provisional Central Product Classification (CPC) of the United NationsStatistical Office unless otherwise indicated by the absence of a CPC number.The ordering reflects the services sectoral classification list as used in theGATT document MTN.GNS/W/120 dated 10 July 1991.  The scheduling ofspecific commitments follows the guidelines stated in GATT documentsMTN.GNS/W/164 dated 3 September 1993 and MTN.GNS/W/164/Add.1dated 30 November 1993.2.The use of  “ ** ” against individual CPC codes indicates that the specificcommitment for that code does not extend to the total range of servicescovered under that code.  The entry “Unbound*” means unbound due to lackof technical feasibility.3.There are two sections to this Schedule of specific commitments:(a) Section I contains the horizontal commitments, which apply to all thespecific commitments made by Singapore; and(b) Section II is a list of specific sectoral commitments;prepared according to Article 63.4.Measures affecting (a) Passenger transport services by air; (b) Freighttransport services by air; and (c) Rental/Leasing services of aircraft withcrew/operator are not listed in this Schedule, as these are measures affectingtraffic rights or measures affecting services directly related to the exercise oftraffic rights to which this Agreement does not apply. The commitment forFreight Transport Agency services does not include freight forwardingservices by air transport services.5.Cabotage services in the maritime transport sector are not listed in thisSchedule, as Chapter 7 does not apply to those services.- Page 431 -Modes of supply:1)Cross-border supply2)Consumption abroad3)Commercial presence4)Presence of natural personsSector orsubsectorLimitations on marketaccessLimitations on national treatmentAdditionalcommitmentsSECTION I.HORIZONTAL COMMITMENTSALL SECTORS INCLUDED IN THIS SCHEDULE1), 2), 3), 4) Unbound for all subsidiesor grants:(i)  to help develop local entrepreneurs;(ii)  to assist juridical persons to expandand upgrade their operations; or(iii) given on the basis of other nationalpolicy considerations including thosepertaining to social welfare, humanresources development, culturalpromotion, housing, education, health.3) Commercial presence, right ofestablishment and movement ofjuridical persons are subject tocompliance with the followingprovisions:-a foreigner who wishes to register abusiness firm must have a localmanager who should be aSingapore citizen or a Singaporepermanent resident or a SingaporeEmployment Pass holder.(However, a foreigner who is aSingapore permanent resident or aSingapore Employment Passholder can register a businesswithout appointing a localmanager.)-at least one director of thecompany must be locally resident.-all branches of foreign companiesregistered in Singapore must haveat least two locally resident agents.(To qualify as locally resident, aperson should be either aSingapore citizen or Singaporepermanent resident or SingaporeEmployment Pass holder.)4) Presence of naturalpersons unbound,except as specified inPart A of Annex VI4) Unbound- Page 432 -Modes of supply:1)Cross-border supply2)Consumption abroad3)Commercial presence4)Presence of natural personsSector or subsectorLimitations on marketaccessLimitations onnational treatmentAdditionalcommitmentsSECTION II.SECTOR-SPECIFIC COMMITMENTS1.BUSINESSSERVICESA.
