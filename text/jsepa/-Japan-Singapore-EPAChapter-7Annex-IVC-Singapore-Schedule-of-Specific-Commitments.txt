SINGAPORE’S SCHEDULE OF SPECIFIC COMMITMENTS
EXPLANATORY NOTES
1. The classification of service sectors in this Schedule is based on the 1991
provisional Central Product Classification (CPC) of the United Nations
Statistical Office unless otherwise indicated by the absence of a CPC number.
The ordering reflects the services sectoral classification list as used in the
GATT document MTN.GNS/W/120 dated 10 July 1991.  The scheduling of
specific commitments follows the guidelines stated in GATT documents
MTN.GNS/W/164 dated 3 September 1993 and MTN.GNS/W/164/Add.1
dated 30 November 1993.
2. The use of  “ ** ” against individual CPC codes indicates that the specific
commitment for that code does not extend to the total range of services
covered under that code.  The entry “Unbound*” means unbound due to lack
of technical feasibility.
3. There are two sections to this Schedule of specific commitments:
(a)  Section I contains the horizontal commitments, which apply to all the
specific commitments made by Singapore; and
(b)  Section II is a list of specific sectoral commitments;
prepared according to Article 63.
4. Measures affecting (a) Passenger transport services by air; (b) Freight
transport services by air; and (c) Rental/Leasing services of aircraft with
crew/operator are not listed in this Schedule, as these are measures affecting
traffic rights or measures affecting services directly related to the exercise of
traffic rights to which this Agreement does not apply. The commitment for
Freight Transport Agency services does not include freight forwarding
services by air transport services.
5. Cabotage services in the maritime transport sector are not listed in this
Schedule, as Chapter 7 does not apply to those services.- Page 431 -- Page 432 -- Page 433 -- Page 434 -- Page 435 -- Page 436 -- Page 437 -- Page 438 -- Page 439 -- Page 440 -- Page 441 -- Page 442 -- Page 443 -- Page 444 -- Page 445 -- Page 446 -
1 In view of spectrum constraints, parties interested in deploying networks based on wireless
technology will be licensed via a tender and/or auction process.- Page 447 -
2 Facilities-Based Operators are operators that intend to deploy any form of telecommunication
networks, systems and facilities to offer telecommunication switching, transmission capacity and
services to existing licensed telecommunication operators, businesses and consumers.
3 The Info-communications Development Authority of Singapore (IDA) will consider favourably
applications by FBOs to be designated as PTLs if the FBO commits to substantial infrastructure
investment and rollout to offer services to a significant proportion of the population within a
reasonable time period. In return, a PTL’s network installation process and the maintenance and
protection of their networks receive special consideration under the Telecommunications Act
(Cap. 323).
4 These networks can have international, nationwide, local or selected local coverage.
5 Services-Based Operators are operators who lease telecommunications network elements (i.e.,
transmission  capacity,  switching  services,  ducts,  fibre,  etc.)  from  FBO  Suppliers  to  provide- Page 448 -
telecommunication services to third parties or who resell the telecommunications services of
FBOs.
6 This includes both voice and data traffic.
7 Under the class licensing scheme, the licence terms and conditions are gazetted. Anyone who
provides the services will be deemed to have read and agreed to the terms and conditions of the
class licence. They will also be required to register with IDA.- Page 449 -- Page 450 -- Page 451 -- Page 452 -- Page 453 -- Page 454 -- Page 455 -- Page 456 -- Page 457 -- Page 458 -- Page 459 -- Page 460 -- Page 461 -- Page 462 -- Page 463 -- Page 464 -- Page 465 -- Page 466 -- Page 467 -- Page 468 -- Page 469 -- Page 470 -- Page 471 -- Page 472 -- Page 473 -- Page 474 -- Page 475 -- Page 476 -- Page 477 -- Page 478 -- Page 479 -
