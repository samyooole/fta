JOINT ANNOUNCEMENTOF THE SINGAPORE AND JAPANPRIME MINISTERSAT THE SIGNING OF THE AGREEMENT BETWEENTHE REPUBLIC OF SINGAPORE AND JAPANFOR A NEW-AGE ECONOMIC PARTNERSHIP(Towards Dynamism and Prosperity forthe 21st Century)1.We, the Prime Minister of Japan, Junichiro Koizumi, and the Prime Minister ofSingapore, Goh Chok Tong, held a meeting in Singapore on 13th January, 2002, andexchanged views and analyses on several issues, in particular on the political andeconomic situation in the Asian region.  Reaffirming our shared responsibility tocontribute to the security, stability and prosperity of our region, we discussedcandidly how our two nations should work closely to fulfil such responsibility.2.We, the two Prime Ministers, looking back at the history of our region, areheartened by the recent positive development that countries in both Northeast Asiaand Southeast Asia, once bitterly divided by ideologies reflecting the East-Westconfrontation under the Cold War, are now coming together. We also welcome thefact that their co-operation with other countries in the world has been enhanced atthe same time.3.Many difficulties and challenges, however, remain.  The sour memory of theAsian financial crisis in 1997 and 1998 is still vivid. Furthermore, the current globalrecession is threatening the prosperity and growth of our region.4.We recognise that the characteristic diligence, vitality and maturity of thepeoples in this region must now be mobilised to inspire in us further creativity,technological innovation and entrepreneurship for the purposes of restoringeconomic vibrancy to this region.  This will, in turn, contribute to the prosperity of ourtwo nations.5.In this context, we reviewed and re-evaluated the role our two nations shouldplay in the region, and have decided that fresh impetus should be given to theexisting close and warm relations between our two nations, by establishing a newframework for partnership.6.Cognisant of the dynamism of globalisation and the rapidity of technologicalprogress which have changed the global environment and presented new economicand strategic challenges and opportunities, we affirm the importance of establishingan economic partnership between our two nations to create a larger and harmonisedmarket for Japanese and Singapore businesses, and to institutionalise regulatory andother policy reforms in both nations.  This would enhance the attractiveness andvibrancy of our markets.7.We are convinced that firmer economic linkages and integration between ourtwo nations will create new opportunities for business, expand economies of scale,and promote stability and predictability for business transactions.  We stronglybelieve that such linkages and integration would play a vital catalytic role inaccelerating and promoting sound economic development and closer economicpartnership in this region, which is endowed with rich human and natural resources.We are determined to work together to achieve this goal.8.We believe that enhancing economic ties between our two nations wouldstrengthen Japan's involvement in and its commitment to Southeast Asia. Suchenhanced ties between Japan and Singapore would provide a framework forcementing economic relations between Japan and the other ASEAN countries.  Thiscould in turn help ASEAN's efforts to integrate into a common market of five hundredmillion people.9.We recognise that such an economic partnership between Japan andSingapore should include mutual elimination of cross-border trade barriers,facilitation and promotion of investment flows, development of capital markets,exchanges of people, promotion of the use of information and communicationstechnology, and alliances of scientific research institutes, universities, broadcastinghouses, as well as of small and medium-sized industries.10.We further share the conviction that, in view of the rapidly expanding roles ofthe private sector in modern economies, such a partnership should not only beestablished between the two Governments but should also involve a variety ofentities outside the Governments.11. Bearing all these beliefs and hopes in mind, we are pleased to announce thatthe signing of the Agreement between Japan and the Republic of Singapore for aNew-Age Economic Partnership has just been completed. Concurrently, we arepleased to announce our Joint Statement welcoming a number of partnerships andlinkages involving the private sector of our two nations, which have been developedin the course of the establishment of the New-Age Economic Partnership. This JointStatement also includes our shared views and convictions on specific issues relatingto certain parts of the Agreement which has just been signed.12.We, representing the Governments and peoples of our two nations, nowwarmly celebrate the conclusion of this comprehensive and substantive bilateraleconomic partnership agreement, the first in Asia, at the gateway of the 21st century.Joint StatementIn signing the Agreement between Japan and the Republic of Singapore on a New-Age Economic Partnership (hereinafter referred to in this Joint Statement as “theJSEPA”), the two Prime Ministers present the following Joint Statement on specificissues.1.CHAPTER ON GENERAL PROVISIONS (ASSOCIATION WITH THE JSEPA)(1) Recognising the catalytic role which the JSEPA could play inaccelerating global and regional trade and investment liberalisationand rule-making, the Prime Ministers note the possibility of associatingother economies with the JSEPA.(2) They affirm that the terms of such association could be negotiatedbetween the parties to the JSEPA (i.e. Japan and Singapore) and theeconomy seeking this association, taking into account the individualcircumstances of that economy.2.CHAPTER ON TRADE IN GOODS (JOINT ACTION IN THE WTO FOR THESTRENGTHENING OF DISCIPLINES OF ANTI-DUMPING MEASURES)(1)The two Prime Ministers recognise a growing inclination in the world toeasy recourse to anti-dumping measures, and share the profoundapprehension that such measures are frequently abused forprotectionist purposes to obstruct trade and afford unfair protection todomestic industries.
