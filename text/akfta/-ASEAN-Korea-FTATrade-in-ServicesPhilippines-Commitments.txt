PHILIPPINE REFERENCE PAPER ON REGULATORY PRINCIPLES IN TELECOMMUNICATIONS SERVICES 
 
The commitments in telecommunication services are in accordance with the General Agreement on Trade in Services and its Annex on Telecommunications. 
In Support of market access commitments undertaken, the following principles will form the basis for the regulatory framework in basic telecommunications 
 
1.  Competitive safeguard 
 
  Appropriated measures shall be maintained for the purpose of preventing suppliers from engaging in or continuing anti-competitive practices. 
 
2.  Interconnection 
   
  In order to achieve viable, efficient, reliable and universal telecommunications services, a fair and reasonable interconnection of facilities of authorized 
public network operators and other providers of telecommunications services shall be provided. 
 
  Interconnection shall be at any technically feasible point in the network, under non-discriminatory terms and conditions, in timely fashion, and on terms 
and conditions that are fair, transparent and reasonable. 
 
  A service supplier requesting interconnection with another supplier will have recourse after a reasonable period of time which has been made publicly 
known to an independent domestic body, which may be a regulatory body referred to in paragraph 5 below, to resolve disputes regarding appropriate terms, 
conditions and rated for interconnection within a reasonable period of time, to the extent that these have not been established previously 
 
3.  Universal Service 
 
  Universal service obligations, as may be defined by the appropriate Authority, shall be administered in a transparent, non-discriminatory and competitively 
neutral manner.  
 
13 AK-ATS/SC1/PHI  
  Authorized international gateway and mobile cellular telephone service providers are required by law to install a set number of local exchange line in 
designated areas. 
 
4.  Public availability of licensing criteria 
 
  Where a license is required, the following shall be made publicly available: 
   
(a)  all the licensing criteria and the period of time normally required to reach a decision concerning an application for a license: 
(b)  the terms and conditions of individual licenses 
 
The reasons for the denial of a license will be made to the applicant upon request. 
 
5.  Independent regulators 
 
  The regulatory body is separate from, and not accountable to, any supplier of basic communications services. The decisions of and procedures used by 
regulators shall be impartial with respect to all market participants. 
 
  The regulation of telecommunication suppliers shall rely principally on an administrative process that is stable, transparent and fair, giving due emphasis 
to technical, legal, economic and financial considerations, and with due regard to the observance of due process at all times. 
 
  A national consultative forum shall be maintained to allow interaction among the telecommunications industries, user groups, and academic and research 
institutions on important issues in the field of communications. 
 
6.  Allocation and use of scarce resources 
 
  Any procedures for the allocation and use of scarce resources, which are frequencies, numbers and rights of way, will be carried out in an objective, 
timely, transparent and non-discriminatory manner.  The current state of allocated frequency bands will be made publicly available, but detailed identification 
of frequencies allocated for specific government uses is not required.
