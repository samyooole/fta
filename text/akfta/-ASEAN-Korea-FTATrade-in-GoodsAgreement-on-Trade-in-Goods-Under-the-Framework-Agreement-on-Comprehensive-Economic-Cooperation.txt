Safeguard Measures 
 
1.  Each Party which is a WTO member retains its rights and obligations 
under Article XIX of GATT 1994 and the WTO Agreement on Safeguards.  
Actions  taken  pursuant  to  Article  XIX  of  GATT  1994  and  the  WTO 
Agreement on Safeguards shall not be subject to the Agreement on Dispute 
Settlement Mechanism under the Framework Agreement.  
 
6       
2.  With regard to ASEAN-Korea FTA safeguard measures, a Party shall 
have the right to initiate such a measure on a good within the transition period 
for that good.  The transition period for a good shall begin from the date of 
entry into force of this Agreement and end seven (7) years from the date of 
completion of tariff reduction/elimination for that good. 
 
3.  Subject to the following paragraphs of this Article, a Party shall be free 
to  take  ASEAN-Korea  FTA  safeguard  measures  if  as  an  effect  of  the 
obligations  incurred  by  the  Party  under  this  Agreement,  including  tariff 
concessions, or, if as a result of unforeseen developments and of the effects of 
the obligations incurred by the Party, a good is being imported from the other 
Parties to which tariff concession was made for that good in such increased 
quantities,  absolute  or  relative  to  domestic  production,  and  under  such 
conditions so as to substantially cause or threaten to cause serious injury to the 
domestic  industry  of  the  importing  Party  that  produces  like  or  directly 
competitive goods in its territory. 
 
4.  If an ASEAN-Korea FTA safeguard measure is taken, a Party taking 
such a measure may: 
 
(a)  suspend the further reduction of any rate of tariff provided for 
under this Agreement for the good; or 
 
(b)  increase the tariff rate on the good concerned to a level not to 
exceed the lesser of: 
 
(i)  the applied MFN tariff rate on the good in effect at the 
time the action is taken; and 
 
(ii)  the applied MFN tariff rate on the good in effect on the 
day immediately preceding the date of entry into force 
of this Agreement. 
 
5.  Any ASEAN-Korea FTA safeguard measure may be maintained for an 
initial period of up to three (3) years and may be extended for a period not 
exceeding one year if it is determined pursuant to the procedures referred to in 
paragraph 6 that the measure continues to be necessary to prevent or remedy 
serious injury and to facilitate adjustment and that there is evidence that the 
domestic industry is adjusting.  Notwithstanding the duration of an ASEAN-
Korea FTA safeguard measure on the good, such a measure shall terminate at 
the end of the transition period for that good. 
 
6.  In applying ASEAN-Korea FTA safeguard measures, the Parties shall 
adopt  the  rules  for  the  application  of  safeguard  measures,  including 
provisional measures, as provided under the WTO Agreement on Safeguards, 
with the exception of the quantitative restriction measures set out in Article 5, 
7       
and Articles 9, 13, and 14 of the WTO Agreement on Safeguards.  As such, all 
other  provisions  of  the  WTO  Agreement  on  Safeguards  shall,  mutatis 
mutandis, be incorporated into and form an integral part of this Agreement. 
 
7.  An ASEAN-Korea FTA safeguard measure shall not be applied against 
a good originating in the territory of a Party, so long as its share of imports of 
the good concerned in the importing Party does not exceed 3% of the total 
imports from the Parties. 
 
8.  In seeking compensation under Article 8 of the WTO Agreement on 
Safeguards  for  an  ASEAN-Korea  FTA  safeguard  measure,  the  Parties 
concerned shall seek the good offices of the Implementing Committee to 
determine the substantially equivalent level of concessions to that existing 
under this Agreement between the Party taking the safeguard measure and the 
exporting Parties which would be affected by such a measure prior to any 
suspension of equivalent concessions.  Any proceedings arising from such 
good offices shall be completed within ninety (90) days from the date on 
which the ASEAN-Korea FTA safeguard measure was applied. 
 
9.  On a Party’s termination of an ASEAN-Korea FTA safeguard measure 
on a good, the tariff rate for that good shall be the rate that, according to that 
Party’s tariff reduction and elimination programme as provided in Annexes 1 
and 2, would have been in effect but for the measure. 
 
10.  Notwithstanding the provisions of this Article, no Party may impose an 
ASEAN-Korea FTA safeguard measure on a good to which actions are being 
applied pursuant to Article XIX of GATT 1994 and the WTO Agreement on 
Safeguards.  When a Party intends to apply, pursuant to Article XIX of GATT 
1994 and the WTO Agreement on Safeguards, an action on a good to which 
ASEAN-Korea FTA safeguard measure is being applied, it shall terminate the 
ASEAN-Korea FTA safeguard measure prior to the imposition of the action to 
be applied pursuant to Article XIX of GATT 1994 and the WTO Agreement 
on Safeguards. 
 
11.  All official communications and documentations exchanged among the 
Parties and to the Implementing Committee relating to any ASEAN-Korea 
FTA  safeguard  measures  shall  be  in  writing  and  shall  be  in  the  English 
language.

difficulties or threat thereof, it may, in accordance with GATT 1994, which 
includes  the  Understanding  on  Balance-of-Payments  Provisions  of  GATT 
8       
1994, adopt restrictive import measures.  In adopting such measures, the Party 
shall immediately consult with the other Parties. 
 
 
Article 11 
General Exceptions 
Subject to the requirement that such measures are not applied in a 
manner  which  would  constitute  a  means  of  arbitrary  or  unjustifiable 
discrimination among the Parties where the same conditions prevail, or a 
disguised restriction on international trade, nothing in this Agreement shall be 
construed to prevent the adoption or enforcement by a Party of measures: 
 
(a)  necessary to protect public morals;

necessary to ensure essential quantities of such materials to a 
domestic processing industry during periods when the domestic 
price of such materials is held below the world price as part of 
a  governmental  stabilisation  plan,  provided  that  such 
restrictions shall not operate to increase the exports of or the 
9       
protection afforded to such domestic industry, and shall not 
depart from the provisions of this Agreement relating to non-
discrimination; and 
 
(j)  essential to the acquisition or distribution of products in general 
or local short supply, provided that any such measures shall be 
consistent with the principle that all Parties are entitled to an 
equitable share of the international supply of such products, and 
that any such measures, which are inconsistent with the other 
provisions of this Agreement shall be discontinued as soon as 
the conditions giving rise to them have ceased to exist.
