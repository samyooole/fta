 
Article 6 
Modification of Concessions 
 
1.  The Parties shall not nullify or impair any of the concessions under this 
Agreement, except in cases provided for in this Agreement. 
 
2.  Nothing in this Agreement shall preclude any Party from negotiating 
and  entering  into  arrangements  to  accelerate  the  implementation  of 
concessions made under this Agreement or to incorporate new goods into such 
concessions, provided that such arrangements are mutually agreed upon and 
applied to all the other Parties. 
 
3.  Any Party may, by negotiation and agreement with any other Party to 
which it has made a concession, modify or withdraw such concession made 
under  this  Agreement.    In  such  negotiations  and  agreement,  which  may 
include provision for compensatory adjustment with respect to other goods, 
the Parties concerned shall maintain a general level of reciprocal and mutually 
advantageous concessions not less favourable to trade than that provided for in 
this Agreement prior to such agreement. 
 
4.  Any agreement by the Parties to modify or withdraw concessions made 
in the tariff reduction or elimination programme in accordance with paragraph 
3,  or  to  accelerate  the  elimination  of  tariffs  in  such  programme  or  to 
incorporate goods into such programme in accordance with paragraph 2, shall 
supersede any tariff rate or track determined pursuant to the tariff reduction or 
elimination programme for that good as set out in Annexes 1 and 2, shall be 
treated as an amendment to the relevant Annexes and shall enter into force in 
accordance with the procedure under Article 17.
