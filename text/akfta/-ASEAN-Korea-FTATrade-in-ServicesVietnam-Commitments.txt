REFERENCE PAPER 
 
I.  SCOPE 
  The  following  are  definitions  and  principles  on  the  regulatory  framework  for  the  basic 
telecommunications services.   
Definitions 
  Users mean service consumers and service suppliers.   
  Essential facilities mean facilities of a public telecommunications transport network or service 
that 
(a)  are exclusively or predominantly provided by a single or limited number of suppliers; 
and 
(b)  cannot  feasibly be economically or technically substituted in order to  provide a 
service. 
  A major supplier is a supplier which has the ability to materially affect the terms of participation 
(having regard to price and supply) in the relevant market for basic telecommunications 
services as a result of: 
  (a)  control over essential facilities; or 
  (b)  use of its position in the market. 
1.  Competitive safeguards 
1.1  Prevention of anti-competitive practices in telecommunications 
  Appropriate measures shall be maintained for the purpose of preventing suppliers who, alone 
or together, are a major supplier from engaging in or continuing anti-competitive practices. 
1.2  Safeguards 
  The anti-competitive practices referred to above shall include in particular: 
(a)  engaging in anti-competitive cross-subsidization;   
  (b)  using information obtained from competitors with anti-competitive results; and 
(c)  not  making  available  to  other  services  suppliers  on  a  timely  basis  technical 
information about essential facilities and commercially relevant information which are 
necessary for them to provide services. 
2.  Interconnection 
2.1  This section applies to linking with suppliers providing public telecommunications transport 
networks or services in order to allow the users of one supplier to communicate with users of 
another  supplier  and  to  access  services  provided  by  another  supplier,  where  specific 
commitments are undertaken. 
2.2  Interconnection to be ensured 
  Interconnection with a major supplier will be ensured at any technically feasible point in the 
network.  Such interconnection is provided. 
(a)  under  non-discriminatory  terms,  conditions  (including  technical  standards  and 
specifications) and rates and of a quality no less favourable than that provided for its 
56  AK-ATS/SC1/VIE  
own like services or for like services of non-affiliated service suppliers or for its 
subsidiaries or other affiliates; 
(b)  in  a  timely  fashion,  on  terms,  conditions  (including  technical  standards  and 
specifications)  and  cost-oriented  rates  that  are  transparent,  reasonable,  having 
regard to economic feasibility, and sufficiently unbundled so that the supplier need 
not pay for network components or facilities that it does not require for the service to 
be provided; and 
(c)  upon request, at points in addition to the network termination points offered to the 
majority of users, subject to charges that reflect the cost of construction of necessary 
additional facilities. 
2.3  Public availability of the procedures for interconnection negotiations 
  The procedures applicable for interconnection to a major supplier will be made publicly 
available. 
2.4  Transparency of interconnection arrangements 
  It is ensured that a major supplier will make publicly available either its interconnection 
agreements or a reference interconnection offer. 
2.5  Interconnection:  dispute settlement 
  A service supplier requesting interconnection with a major supplier will have recourse, either: 
  (a)  at any time; or 
(b)  after  a  reasonable  period  of  time  which  has  been  made  publicly  known  to  an 
independent domestic  body,  which may be a regulatory  body as referred to  in 
paragraph 5 below, to resolve disputes regarding appropriate terms, conditions and 
rates for interconnection within a reasonable period of time, to the extent that these 
have not been established previously. 
3.  Universal service 
  Any Party has the right to define the kind of universal service obligation it wishes to maintain.  
Such  obligations  will  not  be  regarded  as  anti-competitive  per  se,  provided  they  are 
administered in a transparent, non-discriminatory and competitively neutral manner and are 
not more burdensome than necessary for the kind of universal service defined by the Party. 
4.  Public availability of licensing criteria 
  Where a licence is required, the following will be made publicly available: 
(a)  all the licensing criteria and the period of time normally required to reach a decision 
concerning an application for a licence; and 
(b)  the terms and conditions of individual licenses. 
  The reasons for the denial of a licence will be made known to the applicant upon request. 
5.  Independent regulators 
  The  regulatory  body  is  separate  from,  and  not  accountable  to,  any  supplier  of  basic 
telecommunications services. The decisions of and the procedures used by regulators shall 
be impartial with respect to all market participants.

6.  Allocation and use of scarce resources 
  Any  procedures  for  the  allocation  and  use  of  scarce  resources,  including  frequencies, 
numbers and rights of way, will be carried out in an objective, timely, transparent and non-
discriminatory manner.  The current state of allocated frequency bands will be made publicly 
available, but detailed identification of frequencies allocated for specific government uses is 
not required.
