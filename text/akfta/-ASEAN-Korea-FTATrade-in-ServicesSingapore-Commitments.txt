ANNEX 
 
Reference paper 
 
Scope 
 
The following are definitions and principles on the regulatory framework for the 
basic telecommunications services.  
 
Definitions 
 
Users mean service consumers and service suppliers.  
 
Essential  facilities  mean  facilities  of  a  public  telecommunications  transport 
network or service that 
 
    (a)    are exclusively or predominantly provided by a single or limited number 
of suppliers; and  
 
    (b)    cannot feasibly be economically or technically substituted in order to 
provide a service.  
 
A major supplier is a supplier which has the ability to materially affect the terms 
of participation (having regard to price and supply) in the relevant market for 
basic telecommunications services as a result of: 
 
    (a)    control over essential facilities; or 
 
    (b)    use of its position in the market. 
 
1.    Competitive safeguards 
 
1.1    Prevention of anti-competitive practices in telecommunications 
 
Appropriate  measures  shall  be  maintained  for  the  purpose  of  preventing 
suppliers  who,  alone  or  together,  are  a  major  supplier  from  engaging  in  or 
continuing anti-competitive practices. 
 
1.2    Safeguards 
 
The anti-competitive practices referred to above shall include in particular: 
 
    (a)    engaging in anti-competitive cross-subsidization;  
 
    (b)    using information obtained from competitors with anti-competitive results; 
and  
47 KA-ATS/SC1/SIN 
  
 
    (c)        not  making  available  to  other  services  suppliers  on  a  timely  basis 
technical information about essential facilities and commercially relevant 
information which are necessary for them to provide services.  
 
2.    Interconnection 
 
2.1        This  section  applies  to  linking  with  suppliers  providing  public 
telecommunications transport networks or services in order to allow the users of 
one  supplier  to  communicate  with  users  of  another  supplier  and  to  access 
services  provided  by  another  supplier,  where  specific  commitments  are 
undertaken. 
 
2.2    Interconnection to be ensured  
 
Interconnection with a major supplier will be ensured at any technically feasible 
point in the network. Such interconnection is provided. 
 
    (a)    under non-discriminatory terms, conditions (including technical standards 
and specifications) and rates and of a quality no less favourable than 
that provided for its own like services or for like services of non-affiliated 
service suppliers or for its subsidiaries or other affiliates;  
 
    (b)    in a timely fashion, on terms, conditions (including technical standards 
and  specifications)  and  cost-oriented  rates  that  are  transparent, 
reasonable,  having  regard  to  economic  feasibility,  and  sufficiently 
unbundled so that the supplier need not pay for network components or 
facilities that it does not require for the service to be provided; and  
 
    (c)    upon request, at points in addition to the network termination points 
offered to the majority of users, subject to charges that reflect the cost of 
construction of necessary additional facilities.  
 
2.3    Public availability of the procedures for interconnection negotiations 
 
The procedures applicable for interconnection to a major supplier will be made 
publicly available. 
 
2.4    Transparency of interconnection arrangements  
 
It  is  ensured  that  a  major  supplier  will  make  publicly  available  either  its 
interconnection agreements or a reference interconnection offer. 
 
2.5    Interconnection: dispute settlement 
 
48 KA-ATS/SC1/SIN 
  
A  service  supplier  requesting  interconnection  with  a  major  supplier  will  have 
recourse, either: 
 
    (a)    at any time or 
 
    (b)    after a reasonable period of time which has been made publicly known 
 
to an independent domestic body, which may be a regulatory body as referred to 
in paragraph 5 below, to resolve disputes regarding appropriate terms, conditions 
and rates for interconnection within a reasonable period of time, to the extent that 
these have not been established previously. 
 
3.    Universal service 
 
Any Member has the right to define the kind of universal service obligation it 
wishes to maintain. Such obligations will not be regarded as anti-competitive per 
se,  provided  they  are  administered  in  a  transparent,  non-discriminatory  and 
competitively neutral manner and are not more burdensome than necessary for 
the kind of universal service defined by the Member.  
 
4.    Public availability of licensing criteria 
 
Where a licence is required, the following will be made publicly available: 
 
    (a)    all the licensing criteria and the period of time normally required to reach 
a decision concerning an application for a licence and  
 
    (b)    the terms and conditions of individual licences.  
 
The reasons for the denial of a licence will be made known to the applicant upon 
request. 
 
5.    Independent regulators 
 
The regulatory body is separate from, and not accountable to, any supplier of 
basic telecommunications services. The decisions of and the procedures used by 
regulators shall be impartial with respect to all market participants. 
 
6.    Allocation and use of scarce resources 
 
Any  procedures  for  the  allocation  and  use  of  scarce  resources,  including 
frequencies, numbers and rights of way, will be carried out in an objective, timely, 
transparent  and  non-discriminatory  manner.  The  current  state  of  allocated 
frequency bands will be made publicly available, but detailed identification of 
frequencies allocated for specific government uses is not required.
