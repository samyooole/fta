ATTACHMENT TO THE REPUBLIC OF INDONESIA 
SCHEDULE ON BASIC TELECOMMUNICATIONS 
 
REFERENCE PAPER 
 
Scope 
 
The following are definitions and principles on the regulatory framework for the basic 
telecommunications services.   
 
Definitions 
 
Users mean service consumers and service suppliers.   
 
Essential facilities mean facilities of a public telecommunications transport network or service that 
 
(a)  are exclusively or predominantly provided by a single or limited number of suppliers;  
and 
 
  (b)  cannot feasibly be economically or technically substituted in order to provide a service. 
 
A major supplier is a supplier which has the ability to materially affect the terms of participation (having 
regard to price and supply) in the relevant market for basic telecommunications services as a result of: 
 
  (a)  control over essential facilities;  or 
 
  (b)  use of its position in the market. 
 
 
1.  Competitive safeguards 
 
1.1  Prevention of anti-competitive practices in telecommunications 
 
  Appropriate measures shall be maintained for the purpose of preventing suppliers who, alone or 
together, are a major supplier from engaging in or continuing anti-competitive practices. 
 
1.2  Safeguards 
 
  The anti-competitive practices referred to above shall include in particular: 
 
(a)  engaging in anti-competitive cross-subsidization;  
 
(b)  using information obtained from competitors with anti-competitive results;  and 
 
(c)  not making available to other services suppliers on a timely basis technical information 
about essential facilities and commercially relevant information which are necessary for 
them to provide services.  
 
2.  Interconnection 
 
2.1  This section applies to linking with suppliers providing public telecommunications transport 
networks or services in order to allow the users of one supplier to communicate with users of 
another  supplier  and    to  access  services  provided  by  another  supplier,  where  specific 
commitments are undertaken. 
 
2.2  Interconnection to be ensured 
 
  Interconnection with a major supplier will be ensured at any technically feasible point in the 
network.  Such interconnection is provided. 
 
38 AK-ATS/SC1/INO    
 
(a)  under  non-discriminatory  terms,  conditions  (including  technical  standards  and 
specifications) and rates and of a quality no less favourable than that provided for its 
own like services or for like services of non-affiliated service suppliers or for its 
subsidiaries or other affiliates; 
 
(b)  in  a  timely  fashion,  on  terms,  conditions  (including  technical  standards  and 
specifications) and cost-oriented rates that are transparent, reasonable, having regard 
to economic feasibility, and sufficiently unbundled so that the supplier need not pay for 
network components or facilities that it does not require for the service to be provided;  
and 
 
(c)  upon request, at points in addition to the network termination points offered to the 
majority of users, subject to charges that reflect the cost of construction of necessary 
additional facilities. 
 
2.3  Public availability of the procedures for interconnection negotiations 
 
  The procedures applicable for interconnection to a major supplier will be made publicly available. 
 
2.4  Transparency of interconnection arrangements 
 
  It is ensured that a major supplier will make publicly available either its interconnection 
agreements or a reference interconnection offer. 
 
2.5  Interconnection:  dispute settlement 
 
  A service supplier requesting interconnection with a major supplier will have recourse, either: 
 
  (a)  at any time or 
 
  (b)  after a reasonable period of time which has been made publicly known 
 
to an independent domestic body, which may be a regulatory authority as referred to in 
paragraph 5 below, to resolve disputes regarding appropriate terms, conditions and rates for 
interconnection within a reasonable period of time, to the extent that these have not been 
established previously. 
 
 
3.  Universal service 
 
Any Member has the right to define the kind of universal service obligation it wishes to maintain.  
Such obligations will not be regarded as anti-competitive per se, provided they are administered 
in  a  transparent,  non-discriminatory  and  competitively  neutral  manner  and  are  not  more 
burdensome than necessary for the kind of universal service defined by the Member. 
 
4.  Public availability of licensing criteria 
 
  Where a licence is required, the following will be made publicly available: 
 
(a)  all the licensing criteria and the period of time normally required to reach a decision 
concerning an application for a licence  and 
 
(b)  the terms and conditions of  individual licences. 
 
  The reasons for the denial of a licence will be made known to the applicant upon request. 
 
 
 
 
 
39 AK-ATS/SC1/INO    
 
5.  Regulatory Authority 
 
  The regulatory Authority  is not accountable to, any supplier of basic telecommunications 
services. The decisions of and the procedures used by regulators shall be impartial with respect 
to all market participants. 
 
 
6.  Allocation and use of scarce resources 
 
Any procedures for the allocation and use of scarce resources, including frequencies, numbers 
and rights of way, will be carried out in an objective, timely and transparent manner. The current 
state of allocated frequency bands will be made publicly available, but detailed identification of 
frequencies allocated for specific government uses is not required.
