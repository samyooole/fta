ANNEX 
 
 
Scope 
 
The following are definitions and principles on the regulatory framework for the 
basic telecommunications services.   
 
Definitions 
 
Users mean service consumers and service suppliers.   
 
Essential facilities mean facilities of a public telecommunications transport network 
or service that 
 
  (a)  are  exclusively  or  predominantly  provided  by  a  single  or  limited 
number of suppliers;  and 
 
  (b)  cannot feasibly be economically or technically substituted in order to 
provide a service. 
 
A major supplier is a supplier which has the ability to materially affect the terms of 
participation (having regard to price and supply) in the relevant market for basic 
telecommunications services as a result of: 
 
  (a)  control over essential facilities;  or 
 
  (b)  use of its position in the market. 
 
1.  Competitive safeguards 
 
1.1  Prevention of anti-competitive practices in telecommunications 
 
  Appropriate measures shall be maintained for the purpose of preventing 
suppliers who, alone or together, are a major supplier from engaging in or 
continuing anti-competitive practices. 
 
1.2  Safeguards 
 
  The anti-competitive practices referred to above shall include in particular: 
 
  (a)  engaging in anti-competitive cross-subsidization;   
 
  (b)  using  information  obtained  from  competitors  with  anti-competitive 
results;  and 
 
19 KA-ATS/SC1/BRU 
  
  (c)  not making available to other services suppliers on a timely basis 
technical  information  about  essential  facilities  and  commercially 
relevant  information  which  are  necessary  for  them  to  provide 
services.  
 
2.  Interconnection 
 
2.1  This  section  applies  to  linking  with  suppliers  providing  public 
telecommunications transport networks or services in order to allow the 
users of one supplier to communicate with users of another supplier and  to 
access services provided by another supplier, where specific commitments 
are undertaken. 
 
2.2  Interconnection to be ensured 
 
  Interconnection with a major supplier will be ensured at any technically 
feasible point in the network.  Such interconnection is provided. 
 
  (a)  under  non-discriminatory  terms,  conditions  (including  technical 
standards  and  specifications)  and  rates  and  of  a  quality  no  less 
favourable than that provided for its own like services or for like 
services of non-affiliated service suppliers or for its subsidiaries or 
other affiliates; 
 
  (b)  in  a  timely  fashion,  on  terms,  conditions  (including  technical 
standards  and  specifications)  and  cost-oriented  rates  that  are 
transparent, reasonable, having regard to economic feasibility, and 
sufficiently unbundled so that the supplier need not pay for network 
components or facilities that it does not require for the service to be 
provided;  and 
 
  (c)  upon request, at points in addition to the network termination points 
offered to the majority of users, subject to charges that reflect the 
cost of construction of necessary additional facilities. 
 
2.3  Public availability of the procedures for interconnection negotiations 
 
  The procedures applicable for interconnection to a major supplier will be 
made publicly available. 
 
2.4  Transparency of interconnection arrangements 
 
  It is ensured that a major supplier will make publicly available either its 
interconnection agreements or a reference interconnection offer. 
 
 
20 KA-ATS/SC1/BRU 
  
2.5  Interconnection:  dispute settlement 
 
  A service supplier requesting interconnection with a major supplier will have 
recourse, either: 
 
  (a)  at any time or 
 
  (b)  after a reasonable period of time which has been made publicly 
known 
 
to an independent domestic body, which may be a regulatory body as 
referred to in paragraph 5 below, to resolve disputes regarding appropriate 
terms, conditions and rates for interconnection within a reasonable period of 
time, to the extent that these have not been established previously. 
 
3.  Universal service 
 
  Any Member has the right to define the kind of universal service obligation it 
wishes  to  maintain.    Such  obligations  will  not  be  regarded  as  anti-
competitive per se, provided they are administered in a transparent, non-
discriminatory  and  competitively  neutral  manner  and  are  not  more 
burdensome than necessary for the kind of universal service defined by the 
Member.      
 
4.  Public availability of licensing criteria 
 
  Where a licence is required, the following will be made publicly available: 
 
  (a)  all the licensing criteria and the period of time normally required to 
reach a decision concerning an application for a licence  and 
 
  (b)  the terms and conditions of  individual licences. 
 
  The reasons for the denial of a licence will be made known to the applicant 
upon request. 
 
5.  Independent regulators 
 
  The regulatory body is separate from, and not accountable to, any supplier 
of basic telecommunications services. The decisions of and the procedures 
used by regulators shall be impartial with respect to all market participants. 
 
 
 
 
 
21 KA-ATS/SC1/BRU 
  
6.  Allocation and use of scarce resources 
 
  Any procedures for the allocation and use of scarce resources, including 
frequencies, numbers and rights of way, will be carried out in an objective, 
timely,  transparent  and  non-discriminatory  manner.  The  current  state  of 
allocated  frequency  bands  will  be  made  publicly  available,  but  detailed 
identification of frequencies allocated for specific government uses is not 
required.
