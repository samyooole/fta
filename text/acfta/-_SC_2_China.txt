Appendix 1 
 
Reference Paper 
 
Scope 
 
 
The following are definitions and principles on the regulatory framework for the basic 
telecommunications services.   
 
Definitions 
 
 
Users mean service consumers and service suppliers.   
 
 
Essential facilities mean facilities of a public telecommunications transport network or 
service that: 
 
(a) 
are exclusively or predominantly provided by a single or limited number of 
suppliers;  and 
(b) 
cannot feasibly be economically or technically substituted in order to provide 
a service. 
 
 
A major supplier is a supplier which has the ability to materially affect the terms of 
participation (having regard to price and supply) in the relevant market for basic 
telecommunications services as a result of: 
 
 
(a) 
control over essential facilities;  or 
 
(b) 
use of its position in the market. 
 
1. 
Competitive safeguards 
 
1.1 
Prevention of anti-competitive practices in telecommunications 
 
 
Appropriate measures shall be maintained for the purpose of preventing suppliers 
who, alone or together, are a major supplier from engaging in or continuing anti-competitive 
practices. 
 
1.2 
Safeguards 
 
 
The anti-competitive practices referred to above shall include in particular: 
 
(a) 
engaging in anti-competitive cross-subsidization;   
 
(b) 
using information obtained from competitors with anti-competitive results;  
and 
(c) 
not making available to other services suppliers on a timely basis technical 
information about essential facilities and commercially relevant information 
which are necessary for them to provide services. 
 
2. 
Interconnection 
 
2.1 
This section applies to linking with suppliers providing public telecommunications 
transport networks or services in order to allow the users of one supplier to communicate 
with users of another supplier and  to access services provided by another supplier, where 
specific commitments are undertaken. 
 
 
CHINA - SCHEDULE OF SPECIFIC COMMITMENTS 
For the 2nd Package of Commitments under ASEAN - China FTA Trade in Services 
61 
AC-TIS/SC2/PRC 
 
2.2 
Interconnection to be ensured 
 
 
Interconnection with a major supplier will be ensured at any technically feasible point 
in the network.  Such interconnection is provided. 
 
(a) 
under non-discriminatory terms, conditions (including technical standards and 
specifications) and rates and of a quality no less favourable than that 
provided for its own like services or for like services of non-affiliated service 
suppliers or for its subsidiaries or other affiliates; 
(b) 
in a timely fashion, on terms, conditions (including technical standards and 
specifications) and cost-oriented rates that are transparent, reasonable, 
having regard to economic feasibility, and sufficiently unbundled so that the 
supplier need not pay for network components or facilities that it does not 
require for the service to be provided;  and 
(c) 
upon request, at points in addition to the network termination points offered to 
the majority of users, subject to charges that reflect the cost of construction of 
necessary additional facilities. 
 
2.3 
Public availability of the procedures for interconnection negotiations 
 
 
The procedures applicable for interconnection to a major supplier will be made 
publicly available. 
 
2.4 
Transparency of interconnection arrangements 
 
 
It is ensured that a major supplier will make publicly available either its 
interconnection agreements or a reference interconnection offer. 
 
2.5 
Interconnection:  dispute settlement 
 
 
A service supplier requesting interconnection with a major supplier will have recourse, 
either: 
 
 
(a) 
at any time; or 
 
(b) 
after a reasonable period of time which has been made publicly known 
 
to an independent domestic body, which may be a regulatory body as referred to in 
paragraph 5 below, to resolve disputes regarding appropriate terms, conditions and rates for 
interconnection within a reasonable period of time, to the extent that these have not been 
established previously. 
 
3. 
Universal service 
 
 
Any Member has the right to define the kind of universal service obligation it wishes 
to maintain.  Such obligations will not be regarded as anti-competitive per se, provided they 
are administered in a transparent, non-discriminatory and competitively neutral manner and 
are not more burdensome than necessary for the kind of universal service defined by the 
Member.      
 
4. 
Public availability of licensing criteria 
 
 
Where a licence is required, the following will be made publicly available: 
 
(a) 
all the licensing criteria and the period of time normally required to reach a 
decision concerning an application for a licence;  and 
 
CHINA - SCHEDULE OF SPECIFIC COMMITMENTS 
For the 2nd Package of Commitments under ASEAN - China FTA Trade in Services 
62 
AC-TIS/SC2/PRC 
 
(b) 
the terms and conditions of  individual licences. 
 
 
The reasons for the denial of a licence will be made known to the applicant upon 
request. 
 
5. 
Independent regulators 
 
 
The regulatory body is separate from, and not accountable to, any supplier of basic 
telecommunications services. The decisions of and the procedures used by regulators shall 
be impartial with respect to all market participants. 
 
6. 
Allocation and use of scarce resources 
 
 
Any procedures for the allocation and use of scarce resources, including frequencies, 
numbers and rights of way, will be carried out in an objective, timely, transparent and non-
discriminatory manner. The current state of allocated frequency bands will be made publicly 
available, but detailed identification of frequencies allocated for specific government uses is 
not required.

Note by the Chairman 
 
Revision 
 
 
It has been suggested by a number of delegations that it might be helpful to produce a 
brief and simple note on assumptions applicable to the scheduling of commitments in basic 
telecoms.  The purpose of the attached note is to assist delegations in ensuring the 
transparency of their commitments and to promote a better understanding of the meaning of 
commitments.  This note is not intended to have or acquire any binding legal status. 
 
 
NOTES FOR SCHEDULING BASIC TELECOM SERVICES COMMITMENTS 
 
 
1. 
Unless otherwise noted in the sector column, any basic telecom service listed in the 
sector column: 
 
 
(a) 
encompasses local, long distance and international services for public and non-
public use; 
 
 
(b) 
may be provided on a facilities-basis or by resale;  and 
  
 
(c) 
may be provided through any means of technology (e.g., cable9, wireless, 
satellites). 
 
2. 
Subsector (g) --private leased circuit services -- involves the ability of service suppliers 
to sell or lease any type of network capacity for the supply of services listed in any other basic 
telecom service subsector unless otherwise noted in the sector column.  This would include 
capacity via cable, satellite and wireless network. 
 
3. 
In view of points 1 and 2 above, it should not be necessary to list cellular or mobile 
services as a separate subsector. However,  a number of Members have done so, and a 
number of offers have commitments only in these subsectors.  Therefore, in order to avoid 
extensive changes in schedules, it would seem appropriate for Members to maintain separate 
entries for these subsectors. 
                                                      
     9Including all types of cable.

CHAIRMAN'S NOTE 
 
Market Access Limitations on Spectrum Availability 
 
 
 
Many Members have entries in the market access column of their schedules indicating 
that commitments are "subject to availability of spectrum/frequency" or similar wording.  In light 
of the physical nature of spectrum and the constraints inherent in its use, it is understandable 
that Members may have sought to rely on these words to adequately protect legitimate 
spectrum management policies.  There is, however, doubt that words such as "subject to 
availability of spectrum/frequency" as listed in the market access column of many Members' 
schedules achieve that objective. 
 
 
Spectrum/frequency management is not, per se, a measure which needs to be listed 
under Article XVI.  Furthermore under the GATS each Member has the right to exercise 
spectrum/frequency management, which may affect the number of service suppliers, provided 
that this is done in accordance with Article VI and other relevant provisions of the GATS.  This 
includes the ability to allocate frequency bands taking into account existing and future needs.  
Also, Members which have made additional commitment in line with the Reference Paper on 
regulatory principles are bound by its paragraph 6. 
 
 
Therefore, words such as "subject to availability of spectrum/frequency" are 
unnecessary and should be deleted from Members' schedules.

The principal services rendered in each subsector can be characterized as reselling 
merchandise, accompanied by a variety of related subordinated services, including inventory 
management; assembly, sorting and grading of bulk lots; breaking bulk lots and 
redistributing into smaller lots; delivery services; refrigeration, storage, warehousing and 
garage services; sales promotion, marketing and advertising, installation and after sales 
services including maintenance and repair and training services. Distribution services are 
generally covered by CPC 61, 62, 63 and 8929.

insured.  If investors on the state key construction projects (i.e., projects that are so listed 
and annually announced by the State Development and Planning Commission) meet either 
of the following requirements, they may purchase master policy from insurers that are 
located in the same place as the investors' legal persons do. 
 
 
The investment on the subject-matter insured is all from China (including the 
reinvestment from the foreign-invested enterprises in China), and the sum of investment of 
the investor accounts for over 15 per cent of the total investment.

For the sake of payment of premium tax, insurance companies incorporated where 
the legal person or accounting unit of the insurance applicant is located are allowed to issue 
master policy. 
 
 
If over 50 per cent of insurance amount of the subject-matter insured is from a larger 
or medium sized city, then insurers in that city are allowed to issue master policy, no matter 
whether the insurance applicant's legal person or accounting unit is located in the city.
