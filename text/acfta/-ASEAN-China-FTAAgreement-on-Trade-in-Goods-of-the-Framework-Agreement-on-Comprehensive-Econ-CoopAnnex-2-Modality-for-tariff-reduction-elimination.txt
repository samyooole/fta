Track shall be subject to a maximum ceiling of:

    500 tariff lines at the HS 6-digit level; and 
 
(iii)  Viet Nam: 
 
  500 tariff lines at the HS 6-digit level, and the ceiling of import 
value shall be determined not later than 31 December 2004. 
 
2.  Tariff lines placed by each Party in the Sensitive Track shall be further 
classified into Sensitive List and Highly Sensitive List. However, tariff lines 
placed by each Party in the Highly Sensitive List shall be subject to the 
following ceilings: 
 
(i)  ASEAN 6 and China:    
not more than 40% of the total number of tariff lines in the 
Sensitive  Track  or  100  tariff  lines  at  the  HS  6-digit  level, 
whichever is lower; 
 
(ii)  Cambodia, Lao PDR and Myanmar: 
 
  not more than 40% of the total number of tariff lines in the 
Sensitive  Track  or  150  tariff  lines  at  the  HS  6-digit  level, 
whichever is lower; and 
 
(iii)  Viet Nam: 
  shall be determined not later than 31 December 2004. 
 
3.  The Parties shall reduce and, where applicable, eliminate the applied 
MFN tariff rates of tariff lines placed in the Sensitive Track according to the 
following Schedules: 
 
(i)  ASEAN 6 and China shall reduce the applied MFN tariff rates of 
tariff lines placed in their respective Sensitive Lists to 20% not 
later  than  1  January  2012.    These  tariff  rates  shall  be 
subsequently reduced to 0-5% not later than 1 January 2018. 
86  
(ii)  Cambodia,  Lao  PDR  and  Myanmar  shall  reduce  the  applied 
MFN tariff rates of tariff lines placed in their respective Sensitive 
Lists to 20% not later than 1 January 2015.  These tariff rates 
shall be subsequently reduced to 0-5% not later than 1 January 
2020. 
 
Viet Nam shall reduce the applied MFN tariff rates of tariff lines 
placed in its Sensitive Lists not later than 1 January 2015 to a 
rate to be determined not later than 31 December 2004. These 
tariff rates shall be subsequently reduced to 0-5% not later than 
1 January 2020. 
 
(iii)  The Parties shall reduce the applied MFN tariff rates of tariff 
lines placed in their respective Highly Sensitive Lists to not more 
than 50% not later than 1 January 2015 for ASEAN 6 and China, 
and 1 January 2018 for the newer ASEAN Member States. 
 
4.  Tariff lines in the Sensitive Track, which are subject to specific tariff 
rates,  shall  have  such  tariffs  reduced  in  accordance  with  the  timeframes 
provided in paragraph 3 of this Annex. The proportion of tariff reduction for 
these tariff lines shall be equal to the average margin of tariff reduction of the 
tariff lines with ad-valorem tariff rates under the Sensitive Track, which are 
subject to tariff reduction in the same year.  
 
5.  Notwithstanding  the  Schedules  in  paragraph  3,  any  Party  may 
unilaterally accelerate the tariff reduction and/or elimination for its tariff lines 
placed in the Sensitive Track at any time if it so wishes.  Nothing in this 
Agreement shall prevent any Party from unilaterally transferring any tariff line 
from the Sensitive Track into the Normal Track at any time if it so wishes.  
 
6.  The reciprocal tariff rate treatment of tariff lines placed by a Party in the 
Sensitive Track shall be governed by the following conditions: 
 
(i)  the tariff rate for a tariff line placed by a Party in the Sensitive 
Track must be at 10% or below in order for that Party to enjoy 
reciprocity; 
 
(ii)  the reciprocal tariff rate to be applied to a tariff line placed by a 
Party in the Sensitive Track shall be either the tariff rate of that 
Partyâ€™s tariff line, or the Normal Track tariff rate of the same tariff 
line of the other Party or Parties from whom reciprocity is sought, 
whichever is higher; and  
 
(iii)  the reciprocal tariff rate to be applied to a tariff line placed by a 
Party in the Sensitive Track shall in no case exceed the applied 
MFN rate of the same tariff line of the Party or Parties from 
whom reciprocity is sought. 
 
  877.  The treatment of tariff lines of the Parties subject to in-quota and out-
quota rates, including the modalities for tariff reduction/elimination, shall be 
discussed and mutually agreed by the Parties not later than 31 March 2005. 
The discussions shall include, but not be limited to, the in-quota and out-quota 
rates.  
 
8.  The tariff lines listed by each Party in the Sensitive List and Highly 
Sensitive List under the Sensitive Track are respectively set out in Appendix 1
