EXPLANATORY NOTES 
 
1.  The classification of service sectors in this schedule is based on the 1991 provisional Central Product Classification (CPC) and CPC Version 1.1 of the United 
Nations Statistical Office unless otherwise indicated by the absence of a CPC number. The ordering reflects the services sectoral classification list as used in 
the GATT document MTN.GNS/W/120 dated 10 July 1991. The scheduling of specific commitments follows the guidelines stated in GATT documents 
MTN.GNS/W/164 dated 3 September 1993 and MTN.GNS/W/164/Add.1 dated 30 November 1993.  
 
2.  The use of “**” against individual CPC codes indicates that the specific commitment for that code shall not extend to the total range of services covered under 
that code. The entry “Unbound*” means unbound due to the lack of technical feasibility.
