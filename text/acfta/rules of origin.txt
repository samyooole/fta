sewage treatment operations. 
262 (j)  Goods obtained or produced in a Party solely from products referred to 
in paragraphs (a) to (i) above. 
 
Rule 4:   Not Wholly Produced or Obtained 
 
(a)  For  the  purposes  of  Rule  2(b),  a  product  shall  be  deemed  to  be 
originating if: 
 
(i)  Not less than 40% of its content originates from any Party; or 
 
(ii)  If the total value of the materials, part or produce originating 
from outside of the territory of a Party (i.e. non-ACFTA) does not 
exceed 60% of the FOB value of the product so produced or 
obtained provided that the final process of the manufacture is 
performed within the territory of the Party.  
 
(b)  For the purposes of this Annex, the originating criteria set out in Rule 
4(a)(ii) shall be referred to as the “ACFTA content”. The formula for the 
40% ACFTA content is calculated as follows: 
 
 
Value of  Value of materials of 
+
Non-ACFTA materials  Undetermined origin   
x 100 % < 60% 
FOB Price 
Therefore, the ACFTA content: 100% - non-ACFTA material = at least 40% 
 
 
(c)  The value of the non-originating materials shall be: 
 
(i)  the CIF value at the time of importation of the materials; or 
 
(ii)  the  earliest  ascertained  price  paid  for  the  materials  of 
undetermined  origin  in  the  territory  of  the  Party  where  the 
working or processing takes place. 
 
(d)  For the purpose of this Rule, "originating material" shall be deemed to 
be a material whose country of origin, as determined under these rules, 
is the same country as the country in which the material is used in 
production. 
 
 
Rule 5:   Cumulative Rule of Origin 
 
Unless  otherwise  provided  for,  products  which  comply  with  origin 
requirements provided for in Rule 2 and which are used in the territory of a 
Party as materials for a finished product eligible for preferential treatment 
under  the  Agreement  shall  be  considered  as  products  originating  in  the 
territory of the Party where working or processing of the finished product has 
263 taken place provided that the aggregate ACFTA content (i.e. full cumulation, 
applicable among all Parties) on the final product is not less than 40%. 
 
Rule 6:  Product Specific Criteria 
 
Products which have undergone sufficient transformation in a Party shall be 
treated as originating goods of that Party. Products which satisfy the Product 
Specific Rules provided for in Attachment B shall be considered as goods to 
which sufficient transformation has been carried out in a Party. 
 
Rule 7:   Minimal Operations and Processes 
 
Operations or processes undertaken, by themselves or in combination with 
each other for the purposes listed below, are considered to be minimal and 
shall not be taken into account in determining whether a good has been 
wholly obtained in one country: 
 
(a)  ensuring preservation of goods in good condition for the purposes of 
transport or storage; 
 
(b)  facilitating shipment or transportation; 
 
(c)  packaging5 or presenting goods for sale.  
 
Rule 8:   Direct Consignment 
 
The following shall be considered as consigned directly from the exporting 
Party to the importing Party: 
 
(a)  If the products are transported passing through the territory of any 
other ACFTA member states; 
 
(b)  If the products are transported without passing through the territory of 
any non-ACFTA member states; 
 
(c)  The products whose transport involves transit through one or more 
intermediate non-ACFTA member states with or without transshipment 
or temporary storage in such countries, provided that: 
 
(i)  the  transit  entry  is  justified  for  geographical  reason  or  by 
consideration related exclusively to transport requirements; 
 
(ii)  the products have not entered into trade or consumption there; 
and 
 
                                                 
5 This excludes encapsulation which is termed “packaging” by the electronics industry.  
264 (iii)  the products have not undergone any operation there other than 
unloading and reloading or any operation required to keep them 
in good condition. 
 
Rule 9:  Treatment of Packing  
 
(a)  Where  for  purposes  of  assessing  customs  duties,  a  Party  treats 
products separately from their packing, it may also, in respect of its 
imports consigned from another Party, determine separately the origin 
of such packing. 
 
(b)  Where paragraph (a) above is not applied, packing shall be considered 
as  forming  a  whole  with  the  products  and  no  part  of  any  packing 
required for their transport or storage shall be considered as having 
been imported from outside the ACFTA when determining the origin of 
the products as a whole. 
 
Rule 10:  Accessories, Spare Parts and Tools  
 
The  origin  of  accessories,  spare  parts,  tools  and  instructional  or  other 
information materials presented with the goods therewith shall be neglected in 
determining the origin of the goods, provided that such accessories, spare 
parts, tools and information materials are classified and collected customs 
duties with the goods by the importing member state.   
 
Rule 11:  Neutral Elements  
 
Unless otherwise provided, for the purpose of determining the origin of goods, 
the origin of power and fuel, plant and equipment, or machines and tools used 
to obtain the goods, or the materials used in its manufacture which do not 
remain in the goods or form part of the goods, shall not be taken into account. 
 
Rule 12:  Certificate of Origin 
 
A claim that products shall be accepted as eligible for preferential concession 
shall be supported by a Certificate of Origin issued by a government authority 
designated by the exporting Party and notified to the other Parties to the 
Agreement in accordance with the Operational Certification Procedures, as 
set out in Attachment A. 
 
Rule 13:  Review and Modification  
 
These rules may be reviewed and modified as and when necessary upon 
request  of  a  Member  State  and  may  be  open  to  such  reviews  and 
modifications as may be agreed upon by the AEM-MOFCOM.
