in paragraphs (a) to (i) above. 
 
Rule 4:   Not Wholly Produced or Obtained 
 
(a)  For  the  purposes  of  Rule  2(b),  a  product  shall  be  deemed  to  be 
originating if: 
 
(i)  Not less than 40% of its content originates from any Party; or 
 
(ii)  If the total value of the materials, part or produce originating 
from outside of the territory of a Party (i.e. non-ACFTA) does not

performed within the territory of the Party.  
 
(b)  For the purposes of this Annex, the originating criteria set out in Rule 
4(a)(ii) shall be referred to as the “ACFTA content”. The formula for the

Value of  Value of materials of 
+

x 100 % < 60% 
FOB Price 
Therefore, the ACFTA content: 100% - non-ACFTA material = at least 40% 
 
 
(c)  The value of the non-originating materials shall be: 
 
(i)  the CIF value at the time of importation of the materials; or

working or processing takes place. 
 
(d)  For the purpose of this Rule, "originating material" shall be deemed to 
be a material whose country of origin, as determined under these rules, 
is the same country as the country in which the material is used in 
production.

Unless  otherwise  provided  for,  products  which  comply  with  origin 
requirements provided for in Rule 2 and which are used in the territory of a 
Party as materials for a finished product eligible for preferential treatment 
under  the  Agreement  shall  be  considered  as  products  originating  in  the 
territory of the Party where working or processing of the finished product has 
263 taken place provided that the aggregate ACFTA content (i.e. full cumulation, 
applicable among all Parties) on the final product is not less than 40%. 
 
Rule 6:  Product Specific Criteria 
 
Products which have undergone sufficient transformation in a Party shall be 
treated as originating goods of that Party. Products which satisfy the Product 
Specific Rules provided for in Attachment B shall be considered as goods to 
which sufficient transformation has been carried out in a Party. 
 
Rule 7:   Minimal Operations and Processes 
 
Operations or processes undertaken, by themselves or in combination with 
each other for the purposes listed below, are considered to be minimal and 
shall not be taken into account in determining whether a good has been 
wholly obtained in one country: 
 
(a)  ensuring preservation of goods in good condition for the purposes of 
transport or storage; 
 
(b)  facilitating shipment or transportation; 
 
(c)  packaging5 or presenting goods for sale.  
 
Rule 8:   Direct Consignment 
 
The following shall be considered as consigned directly from the exporting 
Party to the importing Party:

other ACFTA member states; 
 
(b)  If the products are transported without passing through the territory of 
any non-ACFTA member states; 
 
(c)  The products whose transport involves transit through one or more 
intermediate non-ACFTA member states with or without transshipment 
or temporary storage in such countries, provided that: 
 
(i)  the  transit  entry  is  justified  for  geographical  reason  or  by 
consideration related exclusively to transport requirements; 
 
(ii)  the products have not entered into trade or consumption there; 
and 
 
                                                 
5 This excludes encapsulation which is termed “packaging” by the electronics industry.  
264 (iii)  the products have not undergone any operation there other than 
unloading and reloading or any operation required to keep them 
in good condition. 
 
Rule 9:  Treatment of Packing  
 
(a)  Where  for  purposes  of  assessing  customs  duties,  a  Party  treats 
products separately from their packing, it may also, in respect of its 
imports consigned from another Party, determine separately the origin 
of such packing. 
 
(b)  Where paragraph (a) above is not applied, packing shall be considered 
as  forming  a  whole  with  the  products  and  no  part  of  any  packing 
required for their transport or storage shall be considered as having 
been imported from outside the ACFTA when determining the origin of 
the products as a whole. 
 
Rule 10:  Accessories, Spare Parts and Tools  
 
The  origin  of  accessories,  spare  parts,  tools  and  instructional  or  other 
information materials presented with the goods therewith shall be neglected in 
determining the origin of the goods, provided that such accessories, spare 
parts, tools and information materials are classified and collected customs 
duties with the goods by the importing member state.   
 
Rule 11:  Neutral Elements  
 
Unless otherwise provided, for the purpose of determining the origin of goods, 
the origin of power and fuel, plant and equipment, or machines and tools used 
to obtain the goods, or the materials used in its manufacture which do not 
remain in the goods or form part of the goods, shall not be taken into account. 
 
Rule 12:  Certificate of Origin 
 
A claim that products shall be accepted as eligible for preferential concession 
shall be supported by a Certificate of Origin issued by a government authority 
designated by the exporting Party and notified to the other Parties to the 
Agreement in accordance with the Operational Certification Procedures, as 
set out in Attachment A. 
 
Rule 13:  Review and Modification  
 
These rules may be reviewed and modified as and when necessary upon 
request  of  a  Member  State  and  may  be  open  to  such  reviews  and 
modifications as may be agreed upon by the AEM-MOFCOM.

2.  CONDITIONS: The main conditions for admission to the preferential treatment under the ACFTA Preferential Tariff are that 
goods sent to any Member States listed above: 
 
(i)  must fall within a description of products eligible for concessions in the country of destination;  
 
(ii)  must comply with the consignment conditions that the goods must be consigned directly from any ACFTA Member 
State to the importing Member State but transport that involves passing through one or more intermediate non-ACFTA 
Member States, is also accepted provided that any intermediate transit, transshipment or temporary storage arises only 
for geographic reasons or transportation requirements; and 
 
(iii)  must comply with the origin criteria given in the next paragraph. 
 
3.  ORIGIN CRITERIA: For exports to the above mentioned countries to be eligible for preferential treatment, the requirement is 
that either: 
 
(i)  The products wholly obtained in the exporting Member State as defined in Rule 3 of the ASEAN-China Rules of Origin; 
 
(ii)  Subject to sub-paragraph (i) above, for the purpose of implementing the provisions of Rule 2 (b) of the ASEAN-China 
Rules of Origin, products worked on and processed as a result of which the total value of the materials, parts or 
produce originating from non-ACFTA Member States or of undetermined origin used does not exceed 60% of the FOB 
value of the product produced or obtained and the final process of the manufacture is  performed within territory of the 
exporting Member State;  
 
(iii)  Products which comply with origin requirements provided for in Rule 2 of the ASEAN-China Rules of Origin and which 
are used in a Member State as inputs for a finished product eligible for preferential treatment in another Member 
State/States shall be considered as a product originating in the Member State where working or processing of the 
finished product has taken place provided that the aggregate ACFTA content of the final product is not less than 40%; 
or 
 
(iv)  Products which satisfy the Product Specific Rules provided for in Attachment B of the ASEAN-China Rules of Origin 
shall be considered as goods to which sufficient transformation has been carried out in a Party. 
 
If the goods qualify under the above criteria, the exporter must indicate in Box 8 of this form the origin criteria on the basis of 
which he claims that his goods qualify for preferential treatment, in the manner shown in the following table: 
 
 
4.  EACH ARTICLE MUST QUALIFY: It should be noted that all the products in a consignment must qualify separately in their own 
right. This is of particular relevance when similar articles of different sizes or spare parts are sent. 
 
5.  DESCRIPTION OF PRODUCTS: The description of products must be sufficiently detailed to enable the products to be 
identified by the Customs Officers examining them. Name of manufacturer, any trade mark shall also be specified. 
 
6.  The Harmonised System number shall be that of the importing Member State. 
 
7.  The term “Exporter” in Box 11 may include the manufacturer or the producer. 
 
8.  FOR OFFICIAL USE: The Customs Authority of the importing Member State must indicate ( (cid:57) ) in the relevant boxes in 
column 4 whether or not preferential treatment is accorded.
