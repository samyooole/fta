ANNEX I 
Annex to Additional Commitments on Telecommunication Services 
 
Principles 
Procedural Requirements 
1.  Competition safeguards 
The regulatory body must take measures to: 
- 
Maintain fair competition among network operators; 
- 
Safeguards the interest of consumers; 
 
 
 
 
2.  Universal Service 
- 
Ensure that network operators contribute to Universal 
 
 
Service Obligation particularly the extension of services 
into rural and other undeserved areas as stipulated in 
the licences; 
3.  Public availability of licensing 
- 
To advise other network operators on the licensed status 
 
criteria 
of each network operator including terms and conditions 
pertaining to the operator's licence which govern the right 
of the licensee to interconnect with operators; 
4.  Independent regulator 
To exercise its functions with respect to the conduct of 
telecommunications operators and the running of 
telecommunications services in Malaysia as provided for 
under Section 3B of the Telecommunications Act; 
5.  Interconnection arrangements 
To ensure that the following principles pertaining to 
interconnection arrangements are adhered to: 
- 
Interconnection and access between network operators 
shall be on an equitable and non-discriminatory basis; 
- 
Charges for interconnection facilities and services 
provided by network operators shall be fair and equitable; 
- 
The technical qualities of interconnect facilities and 
services provided by network operators shall be of no less 
quality than that provided by them within their own 
networks; 
- 
A domestic network operator in any of the market 
segments shall not abuse its market power to limit access 
to essential facilities only for interconnection; 
- 
The network operator that provides the access connection 
to the customer should be allowed to tell him (the 
customer); 
- 
No cross-subsidies should be allowed between carriers 
whereby one carrier has to bear an inequitable share of 
the Universal Service Obligation burden where the said 
share is not proportional to its market share.
