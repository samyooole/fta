Goods Not Wholly Produced or Obtained 
 
1.  For the purposes of Article 2(c) of this ANNEX, except for 
those  goods  covered  under  Paragraph  2,  a  good  shall  be 
treated as an originating good: 
 
(a)  if the good has a regional value content of not less 
than  40  per  cent  of  FOB  calculated  using  the 
formula as described in Article 5 of this ANNEX, and 
the final process of production is performed within a 
Party; or 
 
(b)  for the purpose of goods classified in Chapters 25, 
26, 28, 293, 314, 395, 42-49, 57-59, 61, 62, 64, 66-71, 
73-83, 86, 88, 91-97 of the Harmonised System if all 
non-originating materials used in the production of 
the  goods  have  undergone  a  change  in  tariff 
classification  (hereinafter  referred  to  as  “CTC”)  at 
the  four-digit  level,  which  is  a  change  in  tariff 
heading, of the Harmonised System. 
 
2.  In  accordance  with  Paragraph  1,  and  unless  otherwise 
provided  for  in  the  Product  Specific  Rules  as  specified  in 
Attachment B, a good shall be treated as an originating good if 
it meets a regional value content of not less than 40 per cent or 
those criteria in the Product Specific Rules.

Article 5 
Calculation of Regional Value Content 
 
1.  The Regional Value Content (RVC) shall be calculated as 
follows: 
 
FOB–VNM 
RVC=  x 100% 
FOB 
where: 
RVC is the regional value content, expressed as a percentage; 
VNM is the value of the non-originating materials. 
2.  VNM  shall  be  determined  according  to  the  following 
circumstances: 
 
(a)  in  case  of  the  imported  non-originating  materials, 
VNM shall be the CIF value of the materials at the 
time of importation; 
 
(b)  in case of the non-originating materials obtained in 
a  Party,  VNM  shall  be  the  earliest  ascertainable 
price  paid  or  payable  for  the  non-originating 
materials  in  that  Party.  The  value  of  such  non-
originating  materials  shall  not  include  freight, 
insurance,  packing  costs  and  any  other  costs 
incurred  in  transporting  the  material  from  the 
supplier’s warehouse to the producer’s location. 
 
3.  If  a  product  which  has  acquired  originating  status  in 
accordance with paragraph 1 in a Party is further processed in 
that Party and used as material in the manufacture of another 
product,  no  account  shall  be  taken  of  the  non-originating 
7  
components  of  that  material  in  the  determination  of  the 
originating status of the product. 
 
4.  The valuation shall be determined in accordance with the 
Customs Valuation Agreement. 
 
Article 6 
Accumulation 
 
Unless otherwise provided in this ANNEX, goods originating in 
a  Party,  which  are  used  in  another  Party  as  materials  for 
finished goods eligible for preferential tariff treatment, shall be 
treated  as  originating  in  the  latter  Party  where  working  or 
processing of the finished goods has taken place 
 
Article 7  
Minimal Operations and Processes 
 
Operations  or  processes  undertaken,  by  themselves  or  in 
combination with each other for the purposes listed below, are 
considered to be minimal and shall not be taken into account in 
determining  whether  a  good  has  been  wholly  obtained  in  a 
Party: 
(a)  ensuring preservation of goods in good condition for 
the purposes of transport or storage; 
 
(b)  facilitating shipment or transportation; 
 
(c)  packaging6 or presenting goods for sale.

Article 9 
De Minimis 
 
A  good  that  does  not  satisfy  a  change  in  tariff  classification 
requirement  pursuant  to  Article  4  of  this  ANNEX  will 
9  
nonetheless be an originating good if: 
 
(a)  for a good, other than that provided for in Chapters 
50 to 63 of the Harmonised System, the value of all 
non-originating materials used in the production of 
the good that did not undergo the required change 
in tariff classification does not exceed 10 per cent of 
the FOB value of the good;  
 
(b)  for a good provided for in Chapters 50 to 63 of the 
Harmonised  System,  the  weight  of  all  non-
originating materials used in its production that did 
not  undergo  the  required  change  in  tariff 
classification  does  not  exceed  10  per  cent  of  the 
total  weight  of  the  good,  or  the  value  of  all  non-
originating materials used in the production of the 
good that did not undergo the required change in

content criterion, the value of the packing materials, 
packages and containers used for packaging goods 
10  
for retail sale shall be taken into account in origin 
determination, provided that the packing materials, 
packages  and  containers  are  classified  with  the 
goods. 
 
(b)  Where the goods are subject to a change in tariff 
classification  criterion,  the  origin  of  the  packing 
materials, packages and containers in which goods 
are packaged for retail sale shall not be taken into 
account  in  origin  determination,  provided  that  the 
packing  materials,  packages  and  containers  are

Where  originating  and  non-originating  identical  and 
interchangeable materials are used in the production of a good, 
the following methods shall be adopted in determining whether 
the materials used are originating: 
12
