INTERPRETATIVE NOTES TO PARAGRAPH 6 OF ANNEX 2 
 
1.  Paragraph  6  of  Annex  2  applies  to  the  situation  when  an 
exporting  Party  places  a  tariff  line  in  the  Sensitive  Track  and  the 
Importing Party has placed the same tariff line in the Normal Track or 
the Early Harvest Programme. 
 
2.  As a general rule, products classified in the Sensitive Track shall 
be  eligible  for  preferential  tariff  treatment  only  when  the  exporting 
Party, which has classified that product in the Sensitive Track, reduces 
its tariff rate1 for that product to at least 10%. A product placed in the 
Sensitive  Track  shall  be  eligible  for  tariff  concessions  even  if  the 
applied MFN rate for that product is already at 10% or below. 
 
3.  The exporting Party would have to give a notification to that 
effect  to  all  Parties  before  the  preferential  tariff  treatment  under 
paragraph 6 can be applied. The notification shall be sent to all Parties. 
If an exporting Party has the domestic legal enactment providing for the 
tariff rate of the tariff line to be 10% or below, the exporting party can 
notify by forwarding such legal enactment to the other Parties. 
 
4.  The  application  of  preferential  tariff  treatment  under  the 
reciprocal arrangement for eligible products in the Sensitive Track shall 
be subject to the condition that a product is classified in the Normal 
Track or the Early Harvest Programme of the importing Party and the 
exporting Party’s tariff rate for that same product is 10% or below, the 
reciprocal rate to be applied shall be which is higher between: 
 
(i)  the Normal Track or the Early Harvest Programme rate of 
the importing Party for the same product; or 
 
(ii)  the tariff rate of the exporting Party, provided that this does 
not exceed the importing Party’s MFN rate. 
 
Nothing in the paragraph prevents the importing Party from granting to 
the exporting Party the Normal Track or the Early Harvest Programme 
rate, even when such rate is lower than the exporting Party’s tariff rate. 
 
                                            
1 For this purpose, tariff rate may include applied MFN tariff rate or tariff reduction in 
accordance with the schedule under the Framework Agreement on Comprehensive 
Economic Co-operation Between the Association of Southeast Asian Nations and  the 
People’s Republic of China and the Agreement on Trade in Goods of the Framework 
Agreement on Comprehensive Economic Co-operation Between the Association of 
Southeast Asian Nations and the People’s Republic of China.  
  415.  If the tariff of a tariff line in the Sensitive Track of the exporting 
Party has not been reduced to 10% and below, and the Importing Party 
has placed the same tariff line in the Normal Track or the Early Harvest 
Programme,  the  applicable  tariff  rate  shall  be  the  MFN  rate  of  the 
importing Party for that same product.  
 
6.  If the product is in the Sensitive Track of both the exporting and 
the importing Parties, the applicable tariff rate shall be the tariff rate of 
the importing Party for that same product, regardless of applicable tariff 
rate of the exporting Party.
