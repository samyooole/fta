The  exporter  and/or  the  manufacturer  of  the  products  qualified  for 
preferential tariff treatment shall apply in writing to the Issuing Authority of 
78  the  exporting  Party  requesting  for  the  pre-exportation  verification  of  the 
origin  of  the  products.  The  result  of  the  verification,  subject  to  review 
periodically or whenever appropriate, shall be accepted as the supporting 
evidence  in  verifying  the  origin  of  the  said  products  to  be  exported 
thereafter. The pre-exportation verification may not apply to products, the 
origin of which by their nature can be easily verified. 
 
Article 5 
 
At the time of carrying out the formalities for exporting the products under 
preferential tariff treatment, the exporter or his authorised representative 
shall submit a written application for the AIFTA Certificate of Origin together 
with  appropriate  supporting  documents  proving  that  the  products  to  be 
exported qualify for the issuance of an AIFTA Certificate of Origin. 
 
PRE-EXPORTATION EXAMINATION 
 
Article 6 
 
(a)  The  Issuing  Authority  shall,  to  the  best  of  their  competence  and 
ability, carry out proper examination upon each application for the 
AIFTA Certificate of Origin to ensure that: 
 
(i)  the  application  and  the  AIFTA  Certificate  of  Origin  are  duly 
completed and signed by the authorised signatory;

79  ISSUANCE OF AIFTA CERTIFICATE OF ORIGIN 
 
Article 7 
 
(a)  The AIFTA Certificate of Origin shall be in International Organization 
for Standardization (ISO) A4 size, and white paper in conformity with

preferential tariff treatment. 
 
(d)  In  cases  where  an AIFTA  Certificate  of  Origin  is  not  accepted,  as 
stated in paragraph (c), the Issuing Authority shall provide detailed, 
exhaustive  clarification  addressing  the  grounds  for  the  denial  of 
preferential  tariff  treatment  raised  by  the  importing  Party.  The 
Customs  Authority  of  the  importing  Party  shall  accept  the  AIFTA 
Certificate of Origin and grant the preferential tariff treatment if the 
clarification is found satisfactory. 
 
Article 8

treatment.  If  the  good  is  still  found  to  be  non-originating,  the  final 
written  determination  issued  by  the  importing  Party  shall  be 
communicated to the Issuing Authority within 30 days from the date of 
receipt  of  the  comments/additional  information  from  the 
producer/exporter.
