Explanatory Paper on 
Additional Commitments by India 
 
 
Scope 
 
The following are definitions and principles on the regulatory framework for the basic 
telecommunications services. 
 
 
Definitions 
 
Users mean service consumers and service suppliers. 
 
Essential facilities mean facilities of a public telecommunications transport network or service that 
 
(a)  are exclusively or predominantly provided by a single or limited number of suppliers; 
and 
 
(b)  cannot feasibly be economically or technically substituted in order to provide a 
service. 
 
A major supplier is a supplier which has the ability to materially affect the terms of participation 
(having regard to price and supply) in the relevant market for basic telecommunications services as a 
result of : 
 
(a)  control over essential facilities; or 
 
(b)  use of its position in the market. 
 
 
1.  Competitive safeguards 
 
Appropriate measures shall be maintained for the purpose of preventing service suppliers from 
engaging in or continuing in anti competitive practices of the following type: 
 
(a)  using information obtained from competitors with anti competitive results; and 
 
(b)  not making available to other services suppliers on a timely basis technical 
information about essential facilities and commercially relevant information which are 
necessary for them to provide services. 
 
2.  Interconnection 
 
2.1  This section applies to linking with suppliers providing public telecommunications transport 
network or services in order to allow the users of one supplier to communicate with users of another 
supplier and to access services provided by another supplier, where specific commitments are 
undertaken. 
 
2.2  Interconnection to be ensured 
 
Interconnection with a major supplier will be ensured at any specified feasible point in the 
network as indicated in the licence.  Such interconnection is provided: 
 
(a)  of a quality no less favourable than that provided for its own like services or for like 
services of non affiliated service suppliers or for its subsidiaries or other affiliates; 
 
31  
(b)  upon request, at points in addition to the network termination points offered to the 
majority of users as per licence conditions, subject to mutually agreed charges. 
 
2.3  Public availability of the procedures for interconnection negotiations 
 
The procedures applicable for interconnection to a major supplier will be made publicly 
available.  
 
2.4  Transparency of interconnection arrangements 
 
It will be ensured that a major supplier will make publicly available either its interconnection 
agreements, or a reference interconnection offer. 
 
2.5  Interconnection: dispute settlement 
 
A service supplier requesting interconnection with a major supplier will have recourse, either: 
 
(a)  at any time or 
 
(b)  after a reasonable period of time which has been made publicly known 
 
to a domestic regulatory authority to resolve disputes regarding appropriate terms, conditions 
and rates for interconnection within reasonable period of time, to the extent that these have 
not been established previously. 
 
3.  Universal service 
 
India retains the right to define the kind of universal service obligation it wishes to maintain. Such 
obligations are not regarded as anti-competitive per se, since they would be administered in a 
transparent and non-discriminatory manner. 
 
 
4.  Public availability of licensing criteria 
 
Where a licence is required, the following will be made publicly available: 
 
(a)  All the licensing criteria and  
 
(b)  the terms and conditions of individual licences. 
 
 
5.  Regulatory Authority 
 
The decisions of and the procedures used by the regulatory authority  shall be impartial with respect 
to all market participants. 
 
 
6.  Allocation and use of scarce resources 
 
Any procedures for the allocation and use of scarce resources, including frequencies, numbers and 
rights of way, will be carried out in an objective and timely manner.
