Explanatory Paper on 
Additional Commitments by India 
 
 
Scope 
 
The following are definitions and principles on the regulatory framework for the basic 
telecommunications services. 
 
 
Definitions 
 
Users mean service consumers and service suppliers. 
 
Essential facilities mean facilities of a public telecommunications transport network or service that 
 
(a) 
are exclusively or predominantly provided by a single or limited number of suppliers; 
and 
 
(b) 
cannot feasibly be economically or technically substituted in order to provide a 
service. 
 
A major supplier is a supplier which has the ability to materially affect the terms of participation 
(having regard to price and supply) in the relevant market for basic telecommunications services as a 
result of : 
 
(a) 
control over essential facilities; or 
 
(b) 
use of its position in the market. 
 
 
1. 
Competitive safeguards 
 
Appropriate measures shall be maintained for the purpose of preventing service suppliers from 
engaging in or continuing in anti competitive practices of the following type: 
 
(a) 
using information obtained from competitors with anti competitive results; and 
 
(b) 
not making available to other services suppliers on a timely basis technical 
information about essential facilities and commercially relevant information which are 
necessary for them to provide services. 
 
2. 
Interconnection 
 
2.1 
This section applies to linking with suppliers providing public telecommunications transport 
network or services in order to allow the users of one supplier to communicate with users of another
