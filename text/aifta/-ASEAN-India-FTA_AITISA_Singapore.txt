ASEAN-INDIA AGREEMENT ON TRADE IN SERVICES   ANNEX 1/SC1 
   
SINGAPORE 
 
Schedule of Specific Commitments  
 
 
 
a) The classification of service sectors in this offer is based on the 1991 provisional Central Product Classification (CPC) of the United Nations Statistical 
Office unless otherwise indicated by the absence of a CPC number. The ordering reflects the services sectoral classification list as used in the GATT 
document MTN.GNS/W/120 dated 10 July 1991. 
 
b) The use of “**” against individual CPC codes indicates that the specific commitment for that code shall not extend to the total range of services covered 
under that code. The entry “Unbound*” means unbound due to lack of technical feasibility.

ANNEX 
 
Reference paper 
 
Scope 
 
The  following  are  definitions  and  principles  on  the  regulatory  framework  for  the  basic 
telecommunications services. 
 
Definitions 
 
Users mean service consumers and service suppliers. 
 
Essential facilities mean facilities of a public telecommunications transport network or service that 
 
(a)  are exclusively or predominantly provided by a single or limited number of suppliers; 
and 
 
(b)   cannot  feasibly  be  economically  or  technically  substituted  in  order  to provide a 
service. 
 
A major supplier is a supplier which has the ability to materially affect the terms of participation 
(having  regard  to  price  and  supply)  in  the  relevant  market  for  basic  telecommunications 
services as a result of: 
 
(a)  control over essential facilities; or 
 
(b)  use of its position in the market. 
 
 
1.  Competitive safeguards 
 
1.1.  Prevention of anti-competitive practices in telecommunications 
 
Appropriate  measures  shall  be  maintained  for  the  purpose  of  preventing suppliers who, alone 
or together, are a major supplier from engaging in or continuing anti-competitive practices. 
 
1.2.  Safeguards 
 
The anti-competitive practices referred to above shall include in particular:  
 
(a)  engaging in anti-competitive cross-subsidization; 
 
(b)  using information obtained from competitors with anti-competitive results; and 
 
(c)  not making  available to other  services suppliers on a timely basis technical information 
about essential facilities and commercially relevant information which are necessary for 
them to provide services. 
 
 
2.  Interconnection 
 
2.1. This section applies to linking with suppliers providing public telecommunications transport 
networks or services in order to allow the users of one supplier to communicate with users of 
64 
AI-TISA/SC1/SIN SINGAPORE - SCHEDULE OF SPECIFIC COMMITMENTS 
For the 1st Package of Commitments under ASEAN – India Agreement on Trade in Services 
 
 
 
another supplier and to access services provided by another supplier, where specific commitments 
are undertaken. 
 
2.2. Interconnection to be ensured 
 
Interconnection  with a major supplier  will  be  ensured at  any technically feasible point in the 
network. Such interconnection is provided. 
 
(a)  under  non-discriminatory  terms,  conditions  (including  technical  standards  and 
specifications) and rates and of a quality no less favourable than that provided for 
its own like services or for like services of non-affiliated service suppliers or for its 
subsidiaries or other affiliates; 
 
(b)  in  a  timely  fashion,  on  terms,  conditions  (including  technical  standards  and 
specifications) and cost-oriented rates that are transparent, reasonable, having  regard 
to economic feasibility, and sufficiently unbundled so that the supplier need not pay for 
network components or facilities that it does not require for the service to be provided; 
and 
 
(c)  upon request, at points in addition to the network termination points offered to the 
majority of users, subject to charges that reflect the cost of construction of necessary 
additional facilities. 
 
2.3 Public availability of the procedures for interconnection negotiations 
 
The  procedures  applicable  for  interconnection  to  a  major  supplier  will  be  made  publicly 
available. 
 
2.4. Transparency of interconnection arrangements 
 
It  is  ensured  that  a  major  supplier  will  make  publicly  available  either  its  interconnection 
agreements or a reference interconnection offer. 
 
2.5. Interconnection: dispute settlement 
 
A service supplier requesting interconnection with a major supplier will have recourse, either: 
 
(a)  at any time or 
 
(b)  after a reasonable period of time which has been made publicly known 
 
to an independent domestic body, which may be a regulatory body as referred to in paragraph 5 
below, to resolve disputes regarding appropriate terms, conditions and rates for interconnection 
within a reasonable period of time, to the extent that these have not been established previously. 
 
 
3. Universal service 
 
Any Member has the right to define the kind of universal service obligation it wishes to maintain. 
Such obligations will not be regarded as anti-competitive per se, provided they are administered in 
a transparent, non-discriminatory and competitively neutral manner and are not more burdensome 
than necessary for the kind of universal service defined by the Member.

concerning an application for a licence and 
 
(b)  the terms and conditions of individual licences. 
 
The reasons for the denial of a licence will be made known to the applicant upon request. 
 
5. Independent regulators 
 
The  regulatory  body  is  separate  from,  and  not  accountable  to,  any  supplier  of  basic 
telecommunications services. The decisions of and the procedures used by regulators shall be 
impartial with respect to all market participants. 
 
6. Allocation and use of scarce resources 
 
Any procedures for the allocation and use of scarce resources, including frequencies, numbers and 
rights of way, will be carried out in an objective, timely, transparent and non-discriminatory manner. 
The  current  state  of  allocated  frequency  bands  will  be  made  publicly  available,  but  detailed 
identification of frequencies allocated for specific government uses is not required.
