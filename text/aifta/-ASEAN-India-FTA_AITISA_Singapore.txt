ANNEX 1/SC1 
 
 
SINGAPORE 
 
Schedule of Specific Commitments  
 
 
 
a) The classification of service sectors in this offer is based on the 1991 provisional Central Product Classification (CPC) of the United Nations Statistical 
Office unless otherwise indicated by the absence of a CPC number. The ordering reflects the services sectoral classification list as used in the GATT 
document MTN.GNS/W/120 dated 10 July 1991. 
 
b) The use of “**” against individual CPC codes indicates that the specific commitment for that code shall not extend to the total range of services covered 
under that code. The entry “Unbound*” means unbound due to lack of technical feasibility.

ANNEX 
 
Reference paper 
 
Scope 
 
The following are definitions and principles on the regulatory framework for the basic 
telecommunications services. 
 
Definitions 
 
Users mean service consumers and service suppliers. 
 
Essential facilities mean facilities of a public telecommunications transport network or service that 
 
(a) 
are exclusively or predominantly provided by a single or limited number of suppliers; 
and 
 
(b) 
 cannot feasibly be economically or technically substituted in order to provide a 
service. 
 
A major supplier is a supplier which has the ability to materially affect the terms of participation 
(having regard to price and supply) in the relevant market for basic telecommunications 
services as a result of: 
 
(a) 
control over essential facilities; or 
 
(b) 
use of its position in the market. 
 
 
1.  Competitive safeguards 
 
1.1.  Prevention of anti-competitive practices in telecommunications 
 
Appropriate  measures  shall  be  maintained  for  the  purpose  of  preventing suppliers who, alone 
or together, are a major supplier from engaging in or continuing anti-competitive practices. 
 
1.2.  Safeguards 
 
The anti-competitive practices referred to above shall include in particular:  
 
(a) 
engaging in anti-competitive cross-subsidization; 
 
(b) 
using information obtained from competitors with anti-competitive results; and 
 
(c) 
not making available to other services suppliers on a timely basis technical information 
about essential facilities and commercially relevant information which are necessary for 
them to provide services. 
 
 
2.  Interconnection 
 
2.1. This section applies to linking with suppliers providing public telecommunications transport 
networks or services in order to allow the users of one supplier to communicate with users of 
SINGAPORE - SCHEDULE OF SPECIFIC COMMITMENTS

AI-TISA/SC1/SIN 
another supplier and to access services provided by another supplier, where specific commitments 
are undertaken. 
 
2.2. Interconnection to be ensured 
 
Interconnection with a major supplier will be ensured at any technically feasible point in the 
network. Such interconnection is provided. 
 
(a) 
under non-discriminatory terms, conditions (including technical standards and 
specifications) and rates and of a quality no less favourable than that provided for 
its own like services or for like services of non-affiliated service suppliers or for its 
subsidiaries or other affiliates; 
 
(b) 
in a timely fashion, on terms, conditions (including technical standards and 
specifications) and cost-oriented rates that are transparent, reasonable, having  regard 
to economic feasibility, and sufficiently unbundled so that the supplier need not pay for 
network components or facilities that it does not require for the service to be provided; 
and 
 
(c) 
upon request, at points in addition to the network termination points offered to the 
majority of users, subject to charges that reflect the cost of construction of necessary 
additional facilities. 
 
2.3 Public availability of the procedures for interconnection negotiations 
 
The procedures applicable for interconnection to a major supplier will be made publicly 
available. 
 
2.4. Transparency of interconnection arrangements 
 
It is ensured that a major supplier will make publicly available either its interconnection 
agreements or a reference interconnection offer. 
 
2.5. Interconnection: dispute settlement 
 
A service supplier requesting interconnection with a major supplier will have recourse, either: 
 
(a) 
at any time or 
 
(b) 
after a reasonable period of time which has been made publicly known 
 
to an independent domestic body, which may be a regulatory body as referred to in paragraph 5 
below, to resolve disputes regarding appropriate terms, conditions and rates for interconnection 
within a reasonable period of time, to the extent that these have not been established previously. 
 
 
3. Universal service 
 
Any Member has the right to define the kind of universal service obligation it wishes to maintain. 
Such obligations will not be regarded as anti-competitive per se, provided they are administered in 
a transparent, non-discriminatory and competitively neutral manner and are not more burdensome 
than necessary for the kind of universal service defined by the Member.

4. Public availability of licensing criteria 
 
Where a licence is required, the following will be made publicly available: 
 
(a) 
all the licensing criteria and the period of time normally required to reach a decision 
concerning an application for a licence and 
 
(b) 
the terms and conditions of individual licences. 
 
The reasons for the denial of a licence will be made known to the applicant upon request. 
 
5. Independent regulators 
 
The regulatory body is separate from, and not accountable to, any supplier of basic 
telecommunications services. The decisions of and the procedures used by regulators shall be 
impartial with respect to all market participants. 
 
6. Allocation and use of scarce resources 
 
Any procedures for the allocation and use of scarce resources, including frequencies, numbers and 
rights of way, will be carried out in an objective, timely, transparent and non-discriminatory manner. 
The current state of allocated frequency bands will be made publicly available, but detailed 
identification of frequencies allocated for specific government uses is not required.
